water so I'm going to twitchcon to review my experience it's taking place down in San Diego the plan was to just drive down this way but uh oh there's a car crash looks like I have to go all the way around and then camp out in this sick desert so I get to San Diego that way to you know to review twitchconz Michael why do you own a salvage title run down piece of [\u00a0__\u00a0] pickup truck from the city of Los Angeles um because it's Swag first of all five times cheaper than a normal truck and the most important I make too much trash at my house I put it in this truck and then put on a high Vis vest and drive around the place where I live until I find places with dumpsters and dump the trash and people just assume that I work for the County of Los Angeles and No One's Gonna bother you you have a high Vis jacket and the white truck with the light on top so [\u00a0__\u00a0] where are we going to twitchcon we're going to uh we're going to twitchcon piss number one well this is a fun quirky story conflict I came back from pissing and the truck was doing some pissing of its own I think it's leaking coolant not really a car person but I want to say that the coolant thing should have coolant inside of it some water in there just to give me two and mechanic store water is cold sometimes so that's pretty much coolant yep up hmm [Music] luckily it didn't matter because the engine was so hot that in the five minutes it took me to drive to the store it already burned away all the water so you know Small Miracles back to driving to the desert and it was actually a really nice drive it was blue skies good day made the perfect place for the truck to overheat on the side of the road that's not good I'm sure that's bad I'm sure that's a bad thing okay no no listen to this mmm good so good this coolant pipe was leaking everywhere how do we fix that I don't know cool yeah so I just took it off so I just took it off and put it back on and hoped it'll work I might need a funnel yeah that's pretty good ah [\u00a0__\u00a0] we're driving for a while and then we'll open it back up and see foreign going to the desert but now you're probably wondering why are you really going to the desert and honestly I had to get to twitchcon I don't need an ulterior motive to do any of this anyways my ulterior motive is because of nystat no not that nice that his brother van neistat he has a YouTube channel and his videos are pretty [\u00a0__\u00a0] weird but they're also really good and he has this one video called should I get a motorcycle and I thought hey I should get a motorcycle and now I have a motorcycle and I thought it would be really fun to ride around this desert and that's it it's just for fun not everything has to be a [\u00a0__\u00a0] life lesson anyway we're here yes this is when I came all this way for God yes bathroom I need a map I meant like a one I could hold that's pretty easy right now I am here and I am trying to get to here [\u00a0__\u00a0] God well let's turn right onto the road that it wants me to go on to and it's a pretty epic truck but I don't think it can do sand or can they ah no I would definitely get stuck okay I can't park here so I'm gonna go up this road and find a place to park this is the closest thing that set it out of Road and this doesn't look like a road it really doesn't look like what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is that what is that it's just rocks that's not rope and so I spent the next hour looking around the desert for a campsite it kind of feels like I'm playing Borderlands but nothing's funny hey dude listen up don't die in the desert I think this is good it's a campground I don't see a single other person at this point I just wanted to ride around anywhere because half the day was gone so I took the bike down using these wooden steps that I made because I have minion legs and then I was ready to go [Music] I'm [\u00a0__\u00a0] stupid now I know I look professional but this is actually my first time going into the desert believe it or not so it's a learning experience for us all more more just me mostly me because I was there and here's something I learned science is really hard ah I also learned that I was lost realistically so I got on the dirt trail and I had eventually I pressed on didn't figure out where I was just got tired of looking in the map I knew it was the right direction after a while because the terrain started looking like this oh my God it's all [\u00a0__\u00a0] rocks oh my God it's all [\u00a0__\u00a0] sad but with no other choice I just kept going and doing desert things like climbing rocks and screaming you know desert things speaking of desert things [Music] I was gonna say I'm a sand Whisperer oh what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] no if you look like I have no idea what I'm doing and that's because I don't I [\u00a0__\u00a0] suck at this the sun is way harder to ride in than I thought it would be but hey it's fun I think oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] that's what I get that's what I get [\u00a0__\u00a0] the bikes on my leg oh God I'm gonna have to cut it off I think I can get out of this I'm gonna turn around hey oh I was feeling pretty silly after that crash so I stopped here to eat and take in The View all right [\u00a0__\u00a0] this and then immediately turn around because I'm an hour and a half away from my campsite and the sun was getting pretty low and then for my next trick I got the bike stuck it's actually so stuck that it stands up on its own so [Music] okay this is sand yeah a few hundred years from now huh it's gonna be sad well I was trying to get it out I noticed this on my phone it's a emergency dust storm alert for the area you know pullover visibility zero don't die on all that that sucks it's said to pull over but I'm not on a road so I'm pretty sure it doesn't apply to me anyways I got the bike on stuck and I was on my way oh baby yeah you know it wasn't the longest Adventure ever but I had a lot of fun I gotta see some cool stuff and it's about time that I headed back so that I could go to twitchcon why always when I celebrate oh oh no oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh no this is the dust storm oh my [\u00a0__\u00a0] god [\u00a0__\u00a0] okay I'm gonna get the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of here [\u00a0__\u00a0] this who could have seen this coming no one no one could have seen this coming but there's another problem this area is called a wash it's where water flows out of the hills when it rains the water Cuts these paths in the ground and they go all over the place it doesn't look that confusing from up here this is a Google Earth picture that I cropped to hide the watermark but when you're on the ground and it's dark and there's [\u00a0__\u00a0] sand in the air it's way harder to see where you're going so at some point I went the wrong way I don't know where but I went the wrong way and the trail started looking less and less and less like a trail worse I discovered that sand isn't really sand but tasty little rocks that you can breathe and eat yummy woman in my Widow tummy they taste so good what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] but it was getting pretty hard to breathe I'm gonna put a [\u00a0__\u00a0] dust mask on by dust mask I mean a shirt so I had to stop and wrap a t-shirt around my face so I wouldn't breathe any more yummy rocks okay get the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of here this way I think and yeah I think I found it that looks like the trail but not for long that doesn't look anything like the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Trail oh there it is but I feel like this scary music's gonna come back I couldn't find the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Trail okay this one I was on just ended I didn't even turn around this time just kept going towards where I thought the road was which is definitely not what you're supposed to do in this situation I'm not sure what you are supposed to do but it's definitely not this and I had no idea where I was I was just riding around hoping to find something which makes this next part really boring so I'm gonna put some Minecraft parkour video on the screen to keep your attention look at that a Subway Surfers oh and I'll go to Reddit and read the top post of today am I the [\u00a0__\u00a0] for kicking my dog in the head and then I'll post it on Tick Tock and then I'll post that on YouTube sorts and then I'll post that short talk on my Instagram oh wow is that the road God and I felt pretty relieved what happened is I saw these power lines way off in the distance and those are usually near civilization so I just went towards them until I found the road and then I was free [Music] foreign I think for dinner tonight I will make scrambled eggs and spam look at how good this looks it's like fried rice [Music] good night [Music] good morning I had a nightmare that someone was walking around my tent at night so I'm probably gonna have to deduct points from twitchcon for that but other than that it was pretty good and uh let's all get packed up and we'll head to twitchcon [Music] not much happened on the 100 mile drive from the desert to San Diego I had a lot of time to think about how fun it had been so far and how I wished I could have stayed a little bit longer but as I rolled into town I was overcome with optimism you see I lost track of why I came down to San Diego in the first place and so I was excited to finally get started on my review of twitchcon 4 out of ten it's all right [Music] thank you [Music] foreign"

      "corpus": "[Music] hey Vsauce Michael here on July 1st of 2015 a long-standing ban was lifted visitors were finally allowed to take selfies at the White House this is the first legal selfie ever taken on a White House Tour but a year before the ban was lifted in February of 2014 I met with the president and secretly took an illegal selfie while on the toilet In The West Wing thanks Obama why am I admitting to this crime now well it's time for the truth who took the first selfie really few people would call this a selfie but it is the oldest known self-portrait a depiction someone made of themself that includes Head and Shoulders it was sculpted more than three thousand years ago by Pharaoh akhenaten's first Chief Royal sculptor A guy named Beck next to himself Beck sculpted his wife to Heart making this also a contender for oldest known asy but the roots of the selfie go back further than this we have been making things that resemble ourselves in whole or in part intentionally or not for as long as there's been cause and effect just looking into a pool of water creates a kind of selfie A Primitive ephemeral one that you can't preserve or send to anyone but it is undeniably an image of the self made by the self even the earliest life forms on Earth were capable to some degree of self-discrimination they could differentiate themselves from the environment around them they have inside them in some chemical form a crude pre-conscious sense of themselves I call things like that a first wave selfie first wave selfies are unintentional automatic or accidental resemblances something makes of itself in whole or in part like prehistoric human Footprints or the mental images animals have of their own bodies the first big leap in selfie history the second wave began with the first intentional depictions of oneself second wave selfies include everything from Chauvet caves 32 000 year old hand stencil prints to the paintings of Jan Von Ike and Judith leister but in the 19th century self-depiction changed in another Major Way a technology emerged that allowed likenesses of the self to be made faster and with less skill that seemed more accurate less mediated and more indexical than ever before photography ushered in the third wave selfie in the fall of 1839 outside his family's lamp and chandelier store in Philadelphia thirty-year-old Robert Cornelius stood completely still for about 15 minutes in front of a camera he built using a modified opera glass and a sheet of silver plated copper the result was a significant image it could be found on his gravestone in Philadelphia's Laurel Hill Cemetery the Smithsonian calls it the first selfie but they also don't in that same fall of 1839 a man named Henry Fitz Jr took a photograph of himself in Baltimore Smithsonian Magazine and pretty much everyone else has called cornelius's Selfie the first but in their archives the Smithsonian calls Fitz Juniors the first the reason for this confusion is that honestly we don't know which of these came first all we can be sure of is that neither of them is the first equally by r a Frenchman wrote of taking a photo of himself in 1837 two years before these but it's been lost and other even earlier examples may have been lost as well because these are photographs people took of themselves it's largely uncontroversial to call them selfies but you know they're not like selfie selfies if you've seen my video is cereal soup you know what I just did there contrastive Focus reduplication that's when you repeat a word in order to focus on prototypical examples in contrast to edge cases for example we went on a date last night but you know it wasn't a date date in that statement I'm contrasting what I did last night which might have been a date to a true date date which is obviously a date okay anyway the point is no one called these selfies when they were taken they were photographic self-portraits the word selfie wouldn't even exist for another 160 years after they were taken so at some point between this and this our relationship to self-depiction changed and our vocabulary had to expand to discuss it what rough Beast emerged to make the coining of selfie necessary well let's keep going around 1846 Czech photographer MV lobethal took the earliest known selfie with a mirror this of course would become a classic selfie technique mirrors provided an easy early way to capture the self with a camera but in my opinion this mirror selfie from around 1900 is the most arresting I think you die at least three times once when your body stops living again usually sometime later when your name is spoken for the last time but now thanks to photography more and more of us are able to save ourselves from the third the last time and image of you is seen the identity of this woman is unknown that makes it the oldest known selfie taken by a person whose name we have forgotten this is the oldest known example of the classic outstretched arm selfie technique it was taken by Joseph Byron in 1909 images like these were a significant step toward the eventual fourth wave selfie the presence of a camera or arms or poles in the shot evidence of how it was made are Hallmarks of the modern day selfie stereotype for example a 2013 ad campaign for the cape times reimagined famous historical photographs as selfies and in every single one an arm connecting the subject to the camera was used five years after Byron's armed selfie Anastasia nikolivino Romanova the youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II and great-granddaughter to Britain's queen Victoria and Prince Albert took this photo of herself she was 13 years old at the time so many have claimed it to be the first selfie ever taken by a teenager but that's not true in 1852 61 years earlier British chemist William Henry Perkin took this photo of himself when he was just 14. however even though Anastasia wasn't the first teenager to take a selfie in another way she was unlike Perkins whose shot feels like a self-portrait she took pictures that feel much more like we today would call selfies the photos she took were personal she sent them to friends to share her mood and daily life here she is posing with fake novelty teeth in 1915 or 16. four years after taking this famous selfie her camera was confiscated and not long after Bolshevik revolutionaries executed her and her entire family together in a basement conclusive evidence of her death in 1918 wasn't uncovered until 2007. although her work was cut short she pioneered the use of Photography as a social behavior as a way to communicate not just commemorate she has been called the Kardashian of her day but despite her influence she was more of a trendsetter for hairstyles than photography she didn't usher in a worldwide shift in Behavior where young people everywhere started taking selfies camera manufacturers didn't rush to make self-portraiture easier and articles weren't written about how great or how scary it was that young people were taking pictures of themselves though the modern day selfie still wasn't born it continued to gestate and kick within the womb one such kick was the use of sticks and pulls to activate a camera's shutter in 1925 newlyweds Arnold and Helen Hogg used a long Pole to take this picture in 1934 Helmer Larson used a fallen tree branch to snap this selfie with his wife naime in Sweden on Reddit Chooch 37 shared his grandfather using a selfie stick in the late 1940s here's one from 1957 and going back to 1920 here's Joseph Byron taking a handheld photograph with others I mentioned this image because a second camera captured how it was taken giving us an early depiction of what is now the recognizable human selfie pose now what I think makes this image so significant is that it's another early Taste of the selfie as we know it today as Jin's rushitz pointed out in exploring the selfie if you Google self-portrait you get a lot of self-portraits there's only one image that shows someone making a self-portrait Norman Rockwell's famous triple self-portrait but if you Google selfie a lot of what you get aren't selfies they're pictures of people taking selfies four the selfie as we know it today the pose of taking one is just as if not more Salient than the actual result blogs and articles containing outrage over people taking selfies in inappropriate places or when they should be behaving differently rarely complain about the actual images they dislike the performance in 2015 Joanne paternapatania published a book of pictures of people taking selfies from which she had removed the environment giving us what feel like selfie poses preserved in specimen jars the idea that those taking photos can be a nuisance didn't begin with selfies far from it there's a long tradition of photographers especially tourists raising eyebrows for being annoying centering themselves over the location and being predictably heard like for example the Pisa pushers found in Italy the modern day selfie that was to come however makes a person look like a tourist everywhere they go not because everything suddenly became a landmark but because people have always loved looking at themselves and as cameras became smaller and easier to handle it was inevitable that people would start snapping more self-portraits Vivian Dorothy Meyer took really cool mirror selfies in the 1950s and 60s but she kept them to herself her selfies were unknown and unpublished during her lifetime a couple of years before her death she failed to make payments on a storage unit she rented and her Works were auctioned off six months after her death in 2009 a collector who had acquired them uploaded her images to Flickr and they went viral inspiring exhibitions a documentary a road in Paris was even named after her the popularization of instant cameras in the 60s and 70s made taking selfies physically and mentally easier you didn't need to know how to develop the film yourself or feel self-conscious turning in selfies to be developed but instant cameras with mirrors on the front didn't come around until decades later selfies still hadn't reached a Tipping Point in 1969 Michael Collins took the first reverse selfie a photograph that contains everyone but yourself Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin are in this Lander right here and every human living or dead at that time is on this ball of Rock Only Collins himself behind the lens is absent in 1983 Hiroshi wada submitted a patent for a telescopic extender for supporting a compact camera an early selfie stick and two years prior Lester wisbrod started what was to become a personal tradition using his new auto focusing compact camera to snap selfies with famous people whiz broad was the pioneer of the celebrity selfie still though no one was using the word selfie selfies hadn't become a thing yet but then something happened in Japan in 1995 19 year old toshikawa haromi known as hero mix was nominated for the new Cosmos of Photography award by world renowned photographer Nobi Yoshi araki she submitted a portfolio of snapshots she'd taken of her daily life and she won the grand prize there was already a unique culture of photo diary and photo booth use among young people in Japan but hero mix's sudden Fame amongst teenagers and the educated Elite made the practice a thing suddenly young people all over Japan wanted to be like her the New York Times called it hero mix syndrome increased demand for cameras that made self-portraiture and proto-instagramming easier LED camera manufacturers to speed up the release of features that served immediate frequent photography hero mix took a lot of photos tens of thousands and her work generated polarized reactions some critics adored her While others found it all baffled now by the time selfies were called selfies the same debate was started again but it was a about the behavior hero mix had brought into focus more than a decade before you know it's hard to say who took the first selfie but in my opinion hero mix took the first selfie selfie her work hastened and christened the arrival of the fourth wave selfie the selfie as we know it today now if it hadn't been her it would have been someone else people love looking at themselves and it was becoming easier and easier to do so but hero mix popularized taking pictures of yourself as a social sharing activity more akin to speaking than remembering less a memory than a message nowhere is this more clear than in the story of the first camera phone picture on June 11 1997 while his wife was in labor Philippe Khan Jerry rigged together a makeshift system involving his star attack flip phone a Casio QV and a Toshiba laptop when his daughter was born he took a photo with the camera and used the laptop and phone connection to immediately email the image to more than 2 000 people social media is strongly associated with the fourth wave selfie but as we've seen it wasn't its origin instead social media was simply a mouth that showed up later and demanded to be fed them online we have no bodies we can't just walk in and be seen we have to upload images of our bodies for them to be there selfies are an easy solution because they don't require other people's help but on top of that there's a sense in which a photo of yourself taken by someone else is that person's point of view it's their story but a selfie well a selfie's point of view doesn't belong to another person when I look at a selfie of you I'm not a third Observer looking at you through someone else's eyes it's just me looking at you selfies allow us to be online first hand not second hand in the same way that brown bears who migrated to the cold lands of the north evolved pale guard hairs and became polar bears as humans migrated into the cold lands of the screen they evolved selfies by 2006 everyone knew that something was happening the New York Times published an article that year about how young people were suddenly taking a lot of photos of themselves was it weird what did it mean not once in the article is the word selfie used but it could have been because sometime between 1995 and 2006 the word selfie was born selfie with a Y had been a word since the 1600s it meant self-centered or selfish but selfie with an ie is new the earliest recorded usage of it is from a September 13 2002 post on Dr Carl's self-serve science Forum Australian Nathan hope uploaded an image he took of how busted up his lip had gotten and he wrote sorry about the focus it was a selfie hope has been hailed as the inventor of the word selfie but says himself that he probably heard it somewhere else first which is likely the word selfie is a hypocrism a pet name an affectionate familiar cuter version of an existing word Australians are famous for doing this barbecue Barbie mosquito mozzie Australian Aussie self-portrait selfie they don't only use I.E they love o s and Z too Australian English has given us probs Rando totes saws preggers and yes even doggo Myspace was an early incubator of thriving selfie colonies but in 2004 when Facebook launched as a serious social media platform for people at Elite universities there was a brief feeling that selfies were falling out of favor however when the iPhone 4 debuted with a front-facing camera in 2010 the selfie was declared officially back in 2013 usage of the word selfie had jumped 17 000 percent in the last year and Oxford dictionaries declared it the word of the year everyone knew what a selfie was we started calling things that existed before the word selfies as well but that is an anachronym a word used out of place in time anachronyms can be words that have lingered around too long like when we say we're dialing a number on a smartphone even though actual turning dials are no longer involved or when we call this tinfoil although it's actually the cheaper and more durable aluminum foil that superseded it anachronyms can also be words from today like selfie that barge back into the past like calling these medieval Church singers the first boy band nailing down the definition of a selfie in the modern sense is tricky of course does a selfie need to be a photograph if not why if so do I need to be holding the camera does the use of a timer or a drone I'm not even touching mean that it's not a selfie or just a different kind of selfie are humans a selfie since God made us in His image because of questions like that I prefer what I've been doing in this video just allow a selfie to mean anything that something has made that resembles itself or part of itself that covers a lot of stuff but can be broken down into four waves first wave selfies are unintentional the second wave began with the first deliberate depictions of oneself the third with photography's promise of recognizable self-depictions that were significantly more accessible the fourth wave is when selfies became a thing a cultural phenomenon motivated by a desire not just to have images but to be images throughout the 20th century especially we found ourselves increasingly surrounded by images news and travels and products and stories the entire world outside our head could be seen like never before not in person but through images in the midst of this image world was the human animal an organism that got to look at images but wasn't one which was too bad because to be an image was to be something well selfies gave us that power they put it in our own hands photography allows more of us than ever before to delay the third death but the fourth wave selfie flattens the boundaries of time and space now we can be anywhere whenever does my face need to be depicted for it to be a selfie well in October of 2013 Kim Kardashian posted this image on Instagram within a month belfie had been added to the Urban Dictionary a belfie is a selfie of your butt but selfie selfie belfie guides and histories and even a belfie stick soon followed and this all raises a serious question about Society if a selfie of your butt is called a belfie shouldn't a selfie of your face be called a filthy and as always thanks for watching [Music] let me show you something I've been working on it is a star projector it puts stars all over your bedroom and who doesn't love that me because it's always just the same stars I could see if I went outside that's why mine is different it shows the night sky not from Earth but as seen on trappist-1e an exoplanet that was one of the first targets of the new web telescope because it's very likely to be friendly to life whether or not anything lives there we don't know yet but what we do know is that it is the furthest known habitable exoplanet from which the naked human eye could still see our sun you can turn on this projector and see us just as others might alien others

take forever okay so these set out upper and lower boundaries for what values we can put into this speed okay at what speed V Should the vehicle be driven to minimize the cost C whilst arriving at the destination now remember you guys told me right at the start right the faster you drive the more you're going to have to spend on petrol right but you can't drive too slow because then you will arrive too late does that make sense now as soon as we know I'm trying to minimize what's the thing that I'm going to do to that cost function over there I'm going to differentiate right so let's do this um usually you guys are used to seeing Dy on DX but there are no wires and no X's to be found so in fact I'm going to be differentiating D what DC that's the function on the left and I'm not differentiating with respect to X I'm differentiating with respect to V that's my variable okay now I'm so confident we can do this part I will just sneakily take this and write it as a v to the negative one why do you think that's helpful yeah I can just use the power law when I'm differentiating it right so let's just differentiate it 10v differentiate it gives you 10 well done and then 93 000 V to the negative one what happens to the negative yep so I'll go minus 93 000. and then what happens to that negative one that's up in your next now reduce it so I'll go V to the negative two okay so I've got 10 take away 93 000 on V squared are you okay with that as a derivative DC on David now I think I should be oh went to a room with no eraser okay I'm gonna get you guys while I go find a whiteboard um eraser two once you've got this derivative here huh what do you do with that to find a minimum that's what you're looking for okay so we want we want to substitute zero but just be careful what am I substituting zero for like can I put zero in here no you can't right you want the this derivative to actually equal zero right because what we're hoping is we might guess that the function looks something like this right and where we find the derivative is zero is this stationary Point down the bottom right now by the way I don't actually know that to be sure the function could look like this for all I know if you if the function looked like this and you found where DC on DV equals zero what does that tell you does that tell you the minimum cost it actually tells you the the maximum cost which is a bad thing right so we're going to have to not only find where it's equal to zero we're going to need to show that it's a minimum not a maximum that's actually really important because sometimes the minimum isn't out like suppose this really was it right we find a Stationary Point that's not it what are we going to use instead it's that word to that started with B before right it's the it's one of the boundaries is going to tell us right it's either the slowest we can possibly go or the fastest we can possibly go one of those will be the actual minimum okay so let me pause right there I'm going to get a an eraser and that'll give you some time to get a derivative okay this is what I've got so far can someone tell me if I'm going on the right track or if I'm going crazy yeah it's my arithmetic okay so all I did was I set this which you guys told me was the derivative I set it to be equal to zero because that's where stationary points are um I then said well I'll add this to both sides right so that's what's put them on opposite sides divided by 10 and then I multiply both sides by V squared is that okay yep so this is what I've got yes agreement no I mean that doesn't look like a square number to me unless it's one I'm not familiar with you do have to be careful though right when you go from here to here there are two solutions to this quadratic equation but we only want the positive one can someone tell me why oh you can't go backwards presumably we want to actually arrive at us at our destination not um not go away from it okay so this is what I've got okay I've got a stationary point but what did we say before like is this just the answer what is by the way what can someone give me that as a decimal what is the square root of 9 300. it's like 96.44 96.4 kilometers per hour okay now have a look at this right is this okay is this susceptible I think if I'm not mistaken I've already hit a problem haven't I I'm over the speed limit right now this is exactly what I was talking about before right I said one of the issues with um finding a stationary report is you don't know what kind of stationary point it is right you don't know if it's a good one a minimum in this case or a bad one right but now what I've found is where my stationary point is not even within my boundaries do you see that so I'm like oh this will apparently minimize the cost maybe we should differentiate again let's just do that to be sure but I can't even go at that speed right does that make sense let's just make sure we do know that we're we're doing this right if I went and differentiated again which would give me this okay so what happens to that 10 when you differentiate another time it just disappears then you get negative two multiplied by negative 93 000. is that okay which last I checked will give you one eight six thousand is that okay V to the what happens to the power negative three very good so just have a look at this you don't even need to do any kind of calculation so you don't need a calculator right if you take a value of V like this it's positive right so you put it in here can you tell me because I only care if this thing is positive or negative it's a second derivative so I'm trying to work out am I concave up or concave down which one is it I don't even need to know its value it's a positive number divided by some other positive number would that result be positive or negative can be positive positive divided by positive will always be positive so you're like oh that's good I do have a minimum right so that is um you know when you substitute in but it's a minimum that's actually outside of our allowable domain right do you remember the word domain like where you're allowed to put in X values in this case it's V values right so therefore since this is too fast what's the closest we can get to it the closest V to the actual minimum is 90 kilometers per hour right because you can't go any faster than that it's a bit funny isn't it we've gone through all this work to find using calculus what the stationary point is but we've found is it's illegal sorry about that right but that's your answer right and you can test it by the way you can just check to see if you're like I'm not convinced this is the right answer see this um V value we can put it into our original cost equation do you remember that cost was equal to oh help me remember 10v plus 93 000 on V is that right so you could put 90 into here actually in fact can you can you put 90 into that tell me what you get and then you can also put something else like say 89 that is also another legal speed right and C do I get something better or do I get it worse when you put in 90 what do you get what's your actual cost it'll be a decimal I assume someone got it oh 1933.3 recording cool dot dot so just under 2 000. when you put in 89 you notice what happens right this number gets bigger but this number gets smaller so that's why we use calculus but what do you actually get what's the cost one one are you sure I'm like that's that's interesting 1934 was it 0.94 okay so no point there yeah so you can see it's a dollar more of course it's not a big difference because it's only one kilometer per hour difference but can you see how what we've done is we used our our model where you play calculus to it and then well the calculus actually told us based on our conditions that the optimal thing is actually too fast so therefore we've got to go to the speed limit that's why the boundaries are so important make sense I will just say one last thing before I send you guys off there's probably a few lines of working that I've not written here because I've just explained it to you but all the logic is probably the important part to capture right so I hope you guys found that helpful"

      "corpus": "hyah topic of this video is Matt exchange multiplication already I have one video in my playlist but there are few things I have missed there in that video so it may be a little bit confusing for the students who are making a new video on the same topic the problem in YouTube is we cannot edit the video I cannot add something to the video so I have to make a new video once again so the contents of the video are what is Mattox multiplication I'll explain this then what does it mean by matrix chain multiplication and how to apply dynamic programming so here I will be giving you the idea approach for solving a problem using dynamic programming right then if you're interested in learning problem solving then don't miss this part then I use the formula of dynamic programming and show you how to solve the problem what should be the approach for solving the problem now the last thing I will show you a example problem and if you are here one day before the examination then you need this one directly so you can directly jump on to this part of the video and you can finish it so you learn how to solve a problem that's all right so how the formula is obtained and all details you have to spend time definitely and if you are watching for learning the problem and learning problem solving then this there are a lot of things to learn from this video so let us start with matrix multiplication first of all matrix multiplication see there are two matrices in this example a and B as of dimension two rows three columns two rows and three columns and B's of dimension three rows and two columns three rows and two columns first of all the condition for multiplying two matrices is the number of columns of the first matrix must be equal to number of rows of second Matrix means these two must be equal that is these two must be equal then multiplication can be done this is the condition for multiplication and how we multiply us we multiply all the elements of a row single row with all the elements of a single column multiply the elements and add their products so that is shown here this is how multiplication is done so this is how one single element is obtained but what is the dimension of the resultant matrix the resultant matrix a into B let us call it as C this is of dimension 2 cross 2 then one more thing total how many multiplications I have done let us see 1 2 3 1 2 3 so 3 how many times 4 times so 2 L multiplications I have done so actually if you see the number of multiplications I have done for getting this result as 2 3 2 to do so so trees 2 and 12 multiplications I have done for obtaining this resultant matrix that is a into B so from this we have to pick a few things first is when two medicines can be multiplied this condition that this must be equal then only multiplication can be done does the important thing second thing what will be the resultant matrix dimension of the resulting matrix the dimension of the resultant matrix will be these two extremes that is number of rows of first matrix and the number of columns of second Matrix that is - gross - this is the second point and the third point that we have to pick up is for generating or multiplying the matrix total how many multiplications are required that is this dimension into this one and this one this is common right this is same so 2 into 3 into 2 so 2 into 3 into 2 these many multiplications are required so these are the important things and one more important thing I will show you that we must know for further understanding see I have two minuses a and B and if you take dimensions total how many are there first second third fourth so two medicines total for dimension but these two must be same so let us call it as one so if we call it as one then total how many dimensions one two three so total three dimensions are the three different values are there right and this is the first matrix of dimension and these are the second matrix dimension and one of the dimension is common so for the two matrices total three different dimensions are there where one of the dimension is common for them so that's all the important things I have highlighted here that is useful for matrix chain multiplication now let us learn about what does it mean by a matrix chain multiplication for explaining Mattox chain multiplication I have an example here I have three medicines even a 2 a 3 and I want to multiply them so there are more than two matrices so and I want to multiply them so first of all check whether they can be multiplied or not see if I take these two medicines than the dimensions this should be matching number of columns of first one should be equal to number of rows of second one yes they are matching they can be multiplied and if I take these two and then see this are matching yes they can be multiplied now these are a 1 a 2 a 3 dimensions also I will label them let us call this as a d 0 and these two are same so let us call both of them as D 1 D 1 and these two are same so this let us call this as and D 2 D 2 and D 3 this labeling may help us afterwards let us I have given the labels now let us proceed so I want to multiply these three medicines now the question is can I multiply all three together no I have to multiply two matrices at a time then what are the possible ways see the first method is I can multiply a 1 with a 2 and the result of it a 3 this is one possible and another possible method is even as it is then a 2 and a 3 I should multiply first then the even should be multiplied with the result of product of a two and a dream so there are two possible methods see whether this one and this one gives same result yes they are associative associative property holds on matrix multiplication whether you multiply these two first then the result with this one or first these two and this with the result you get the same answer so the product of three minuses will be same so you can multiply it any either way now whatever the elements may be there in a 1 a 2 a 3 I am NOT interested in that I am NOT really trying to multiply them I want to know how much efforts I have to put in for multiplying them so let us see if I multiply a 1 with a 2 then total how many multiplications I have to do how many multiplications I have to perform so what are those dimensions 2 3 & 3 4 so total how many multiplications will be done here for multiplying this this is 2 into 3 into 4 these are 24 multiplications this side total 24 multiplications if I'm multiplying madiso say one with a 2 total 24 multiplications I have to perform for those elements now what about this one this is dimensions are 4 2 but how many this if you take this separately no multiplications required for this one so 24 multiplications for this and this is nothing now I have to multiply these two together right this whole thing this whole thing with this one so total how many multiplications required for this this this will be having dimensions to cross 4 right see you remember the resultant matrix will have the dimensions of these two number of rows of first one and number of columns of second one these two and this 1 4 2 so these 2 are same yes multiplication can be done so total how many multiplications for this this is 2 into 4 into 2 so these are 16 multiplications right these are total 16 now if you find out altogether 24 multiplications this side plus 0 multiplication that site plus the sixteen multiplications so this is how much 24 plus 16 40 multiplications I have to do multiplying these two takes twenty four multiplications and this is nothing there's a single matrix is zero then multiplying these two together as two for two so total 40 multiplications are required what about this let us take this the dimensions are 2 3 and this is 3 4 & 4 2 first of all I have to multiply this this is 3 into 4 into 2 so this is 24 and the result of this the dimensions will be 3 2 and what about this side this side will be 0 no multiplications required on this side now when I have to multiply these two together the dimensions are 2 3 and this is 3 do right these are the dimensions like this one and this one so these two are common so same we can multiply these 2 are same we can multiply so total how many multi predictions required for this one 2 into 3 into 2 then plus what about this side 0 what about this side this is total multiplications are 24 24 so 24 plus this is 2 3 6 12 so this is 36 multiplication so total 36 modifications are required so observe this carefully you wash it once again this portion is very important this calculation and from this we can say that if I multiply these 2 first and the result with this one or this is the result of this one the cost of multiplication is different means the number of multiplications I have to perform for getting the results are different so which parentheses ation is better means first I should multiply these two matrices then this with the result of this one that will take only 36 multiplication so it's a small example of just three matrices and there are there is a difference of just 4 so 4 is not a small figure right because the number of matrices are very small we are looking at a very small level if suppose you have mattis's a 1 multiplied with a 2 multiplied with a 3 goes on to a 10 their total cost of multiplication means which mattresses should be multiplied first it is a big problem there so you cannot simply start multiplying a a 1 with a 2 then the result with a trill result is a 4 so it will be very very huge if you find out easier method for multiplying them then it's better so first find out how to multiply them then multiply the matricis so that's it if you have the chain of mattresses for multiplication then first of all find out which multiplication should be performed such that the total efforts put in for multiplying them should be minimized this is Matt exchange multiplication problem so if the chain of mattresses are there that has to be multiplied how the parents addition should be done such that the efforts required for multiplying the medicine should be less see here you can see that if you multiply these two and the result with this one is 40 and this way it is 36 so this is better and if you have 10 mattresses then there may be different possibilities and one of the possibility maybe a best possibility so that's it we have to find out the best possible parenthesis ation such that the total cost of multiplication is minimized now we need a approach for finding the minimum one so dynamic programming approach say is that you should try all possible parenthesis ation and pick up the best one possible all possible one and pick up the best one so for 10 we have to try all possibilities and then whichever is giving minimum you have to take that pattern of multiplication so for 3 how many are there only 2 are there so we tried both of them and we found this is better so we have already done this but this we can't think of doing on 10 mattresses imagine how many possibilities you will have but we must find out all possible from that we should pick up the best one so for this we need some formula that is by using this approach we need some formula let us frame a formula for dynamic programming format exchange multiplications so here already I have an example so this I will convert it into a formula right I have two examples here from this only I will make a formula first of all watch this very carefully am creating or generating a formula from this example so let us say I want to find out the minimum cost for multiplication so I have to find out the cost of one two three so there are three matrices let us say cost of 1 2 3 so I just write C now for cost ok then let us look at this observe this what is this 24 this is the cost of multiplying 1 and do so I will remove this as I move this and this I will say cost of multiplying 1 to 2 and what is the 0 see a was writing 0 that was not required that time I should have skipped but now this is useful you see this is cost of multiplying third matrix with the third Matic something so the cost of this side is 1 to 2 cost of that side is radio 3 and that was 0 and this was 24 this was 24 I will write it right this is 0 24 and 0 so cost of this one and cost of this one so final result what I was getting this was cost of 1 to 2 and this was cost of 3 to 3 and 3 to 3 is 0 because the single matrix then what was this the cost of multiplying these two together these two together so these are the dimensions I have what is this dimension this one this is a d 0 this is d 0 what is this dimension this 1 this is what D 2 this is D 2 so this is nitu and what is this dimension this one last one right what is that D 3 this is d 3 so what are these this is D 0 and this is D 2 and this is D B 0 D 2 D 3 I have multiplied these three and I got the result as 40 now let us convert this also into the formula this is first cost off one come upon cost of multiplying 1 comma 1 itself that 0 it is a single matrix only and what is this cost of 2 2 3 and what is this 24 how to get this 1 this is 3 into 4 into 2 we know interval so and it is cost of multiplying 2 root 3 then what is this cost of 1 comma 1 and this is what cost of 2 comma 3 and what are these dimensions this is this is the first one and that is D 0 this is D 0 right and this is 3 this is an e 1 3 3 is in D 1 yes this is d 1 and this is the last one that is D 3 this is d 3 and this is 36 so I have made it like a formula cost of this side left side cost of right side then cost of multiplying two together so I got it in the form of formula let us observe this if you observe 1 2 3 3 1 1 2 3 so if you observe the first one and the last one are same let us call this as I and this as J and this as I and this as J in both I and J are same then what about this D 0 D 3 D 0 D 3 and this is d1 and this is d2 so let us call this as D I minus 1 and this is J is 3 right this is DG let us call this as D of I minus 1 and this is DJ then what is this this is a 2 & 3 this is 1 & 2 so if this is 1 this is 2 if this is 2 this is 3 this is what I am observing right this is my from the observation I am creating a formula then this is a d1 and this is d2 so it means that that part should come first so let me write a formula so I'll write the formula here I'll write it here see I have to find out the cost off for I Comanche is what this site cost of I comma what is this I should call it as K and this is K plus 1 so I'm here also I should call it as K and this is K plus 1 so now if you observe everything is perfect see see you off or I ke k plus 1 to J see off of I k k plus 1 to J so when you say I J that are 1 3 and these are also 1 3 k is here 2 & 3 k is here 1 & 2 and this is 0 & 3 this is 0 & 3 so I minus 1 J I minus 1 J and this is DK k is 1 first time and k is to that second time so let us call it as DK okay this is K so based on this I will write a formula now this side see off I can cost of left side plus cost of right side k plus 1 to j then plus d of i minus 1 k and DJ dimension i minus 1 into as remove this dimension K into dimension J so have combined these two together in terms of ijk then what K is taking the value K is here first time 1 and second time - so that should come first then this one Sookie can takes the values that are starting from I is what 1 1 so K takes the values from I but less than J K is not becoming 3 K became 1 and K became two that's all out of these two I want minimum I want minimum so this is the formula for Mack Chane multiplication so from examples of just three matrices I have prepared the formula so the idea here is that once again I will tell you this is the cost of multiplying these two sides then what is the cost of left side cost of right side those two are it done here cost of left side and cost of right side how I multiply these by multiplying three dimensions right what about this cost this also multiply these dimensions three dimensions and give the result multiply these three dimensions and get the result it's the same thing so the cost of multiplying two minuses you have to multiply the dimensions and you get the number of multiplications so here is a formula this formula will give you minimum so you should try different values of K here we tried K as 1 than K as a 2 as you have three matrices so only K value can be one and two if you have more mattresses than K value give me 1 2 3 4 so on if you have 10 mattresses up to 9 it will go so this formula says that try all possibilities and pick up the best one minimum 1 what are the possibilities you change the K value so some on this side some on that side so now I will write down the formula here and I will remove this and I will show you how it looks like for for mattresses then afterwards we will solve a problem here I have four mattresses and let us say dimensions are d0 d1 and d2 d3 d4 these are the dimensions what are the possible ways of multiplying those mattresses before match actually multiplying mattresses we want to know which parentheses ation will require less efforts of multiplication so there are many methods of parenthesis ation this is the first one a one with this one a two with the result of 2 3 right 3 4 then a 1 then inside this 3 first I can multiply these 2 then this 1 so this is another pattern solution or even a two-bit result of a 3 or 4 or this site a 4 is left over a 1 with result of a 2 a 3 then this entire thing with a for a first you need to delicately resolute therefore there are five different methods of parents inhalation so if you want to know for four mattresses how many patterns installations are possible five so if you want to know how many multiplications are required for this one so there is a formula called Catalan number as we have four mattresses so you can use that actually the formula is a 2 NC n by n plus 1 but here you have to take n as number of mattresses minus 1 so n should be 4 minus 1 you should not take and as a for just you take 3 and then you get dancer so if there are four mattresses then actual value if I write here is 2 into n minus 1 C of n minus 1 by n minus 1 plus 1 is n only so this will be the formula modified format exchange multiplication so let us put this one I have for Madison so this will be what if I take four mattresses 2 into 4 minus 1 that is a 3 and see this is also 3 by this is n for mattresses are there where n is 4 I have taken in as 4 so this will be 6 C 3 by 4 so 63 by 4 is 6 into 5 into 4 divided by 3 into 2 into 1 whole divided by 4 4 4 gives cancel teeth 2 3 6 cancel so 5 is the answer and if you take n is equals to 5 mantises then take one less for N and put this in this formula then you will get 14 so 4 5 Madison's 14 multiplications are required right foot impossible parent solutions are there for this 5 possible parent solutions are there so out of these 5 we have to pick up the best parenthesis ation that is giving minimum result so this we will do it using the formula so now I will remove this I will use this formula and show you how I can apply that formula on these four mattresses and if I apply what problems I faced then I will show you the solution for that problem then later on we will find example problem so I will use the formula on this for mattresses we don't have the dimensions let them be D 0 D 1 D 2 only when we see the example that time I take some values if I apply the formula the cost of CEO of one to four because four 9s asada that are one before so I is 1 and J is for this should be minimum of minimum of K should take the values greater than or equal to I is what 1 and less than J that is 4 so what are the possible values K can take K can be 1 K can be 2 and K can be 3 3 values are possible for K less than 4 so if I put K as a 1 in this one right what it looks like CEO of I is 1 J is for remember this one comma K is what 1 plus C of k plus 1 K is 1 min ski is 2 k plus 1 is 2 and G is a 4 plus this is D of I minus 1 I is what I got 1 this is 0 D 0 plus K DK k is what now K I'm taking in s 1 K is 1 and this is into sorry and this is into D for this is K value as 1 if I take K value has a 2 this is 1 2 2 plus C or 4 3 2 4 + D 0 + D - sorry into D 2 into D for then if I take K value as a 3 then this is 1 3 plus C of 4 4 plus D 0 into D 3 in 2d for if I expand the formula I get a 3 different tones 3 different values all of this I have to take minimum I'm not writing them in a single line it will be very lengthy on paper and you can do that right so comma comma this common this come on this one so K is 1 K is 2 K is 3 out of this it is trying all possible parenthesis ation right so actually these means if I draw first one means a1 with a2 a3 a4 how they are multiplied we don't know so this is a 1 1 this is 2 2 4 the cost of this and how what is the cost of multiplying these two their dimensions D 0 D 1 and D for then what the second one means second one means a1 with a 2 and this parenthesis then this is a3 and a4 so the parent isolation is done at Matt X 2 K is a 2 so want to go on this side 3 to 4 on this side then cost of this and cost of this then cost of multiplying these two cost of multiplying these 2 then this one last one says a1 a2 a3 and this side is a 4 so the cost of multiplying all 3 with this result 1 2 3 & 4 2 4 1 2 3 & 4 2 4 then the cost of multiplying these two together these 2 together so this is trying all possibilities now if I know the answer if I know the values I can put these values and get the answer so from this you already know two values what are those c1 1 single matrix 0 you remember we have taken it and see for 4 it is 0 this is 0 then what about c2 for let me put it here this I can take it as 0 but C 2 for let me expand c2 for is minimum or it's a formula again K takes the values from 2:00 till 4 so K can take what values K can be 2 and K can be 3 so 2 values it can take now from this if I take the formula C is a 2 J is a 4 I do G's for remember this 2 comma 2 plus C of 3 comma 4 plus dimension 2 into dimension sorry this is 1 and 2 and this is dimension so see I k k plus 1 2 j k is 1 right this is di minus 1 DK and each so you can check it you can pause and check it i have used the formula here where k values 2 IJ and r2 for now see i k k is 3 plus c of k plus 1 that is 4 2 j that is 4 then plus D I minus 1 I is a 2 so d1 into d k k is 3 3 in 2d for oh it means that for finding C of 2 comma 4 again I need formulas 2 comma 4 I need again formula so in this one this value I know 0 4 4 0 then what about the 3 4 so on n I will find out C this thing this thing this entire formula is just one cost here this one what about this what about this what about this I have to find out all of them so it's too lengthy for finding this one first of all I should find out this right and find out these so why can't we first find out these smaller values then go for larger value so what does it mean by smaller value larger value let us check this 4-1 how much 3 so this require three formulas three values right very different values this is 4 minus 2 this is 2 so this required to value sort of which we will pick up anyone then what about 3 1 comma 2 it will have only 1 value and what about three comma four it will have only one value see the difference is one difference is one and differences zero difference is a - right difference is two so it means first I should find out which formulas where the difference of I and J is zero then it is 1 then it is a two then it is a three in this way I should proceed I should not put the formula and first find out this one then for this I have to find out this it will be going expanding like this it's not practical it's not practical then how I should do this one so first I should find smaller values then I can get the larger value and one more important thing you observe here see I have three comma four in this formula I have three comma four here also so if I find out three comma four it is useful at a different places right not just at one place it is useful that a difference list is 4 comma 4 that's the same thing only right so it means how actually we should solve this problem so for this we will prepare a table we will prepare our table four rows four columns now this represents so this is one two three four and one two three four these are row numbers let us call them as I and these are column numbers let us call them as J so what I will do is first I will find out smaller values that is C of 1 1 C of 2 to see off 3 3 and C or 4 for this I will find out means one 1 two 2 three 3 four 4 so this will already 0 I know it right so already I have shown you this one so this will be 0 so I fill them with 0 already then I will find out the values which differences one difference is 1 Mills 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 right C 1 2 & 2 3 & 3 for these values I will find out then the difference with two difference with 3 finally so in this way I will have filled this diagonal than this diagonal than this diagonal and this diagonal so in this way let us find out the cost so let us start finding the cost from smaller values not from the larger value this is okay and what should be the name of that table let us call it as I am calling it as sina cost cost so let us see see in the previous video I wrote it as M because this was a Desai was taking it as M M so M for Mattox multiplications the cost of matrix multiplication you can use any name that is not a shoe now one more table I will make what is that table I'll prepare a table first so this is again four rows four columns four rows four columns I will prepare this is one two three four and one two three four what is this for see out of these three aisle between the minimum one and that cost I'll be writing there yes remember this out of these two I'll be taking the minimum one and I will be writing the cost of 2 comma 4 here 2 comma 4 I will be filling it so I will find out minimum of these 2 so what is the difference between these 2 k value is different k value so k value is a 2 and k values 3 so i need to know for which K value I got this minimum answer k can be 1 K can be 2 k can be 3 so which k has given me a minimum answer so DISA table let us call it as k table okay and in the previous video I was calling it as si table so in the textbooks you will find s as the name so I have taken s only but now here I am using variable K so let us call it as key table K values will be there now I will take an example problem and I will solve it let us see how we can solve it by first solving smaller problems then with the larger problem so in this table already we knows 1 1 2 2 3 3 right and for food now let us fill up the list of the value so I will take some dimensions for the for mattresses and I will solve it so I have taken the dimensions for mitosis are there this is a dimension B 0 and this is D 1 this is D 2 D 3 before for dimensions that is total 5 dimensions starting from 0 onwards 0 1 2 3 4 so format assess I have now as I said that we will use this formula but we will not directly put 1 comma 4 here we will put smaller value so in which way we will start with differences that is a difference 0 difference 1 and defense 2 different 0 already I have fill there so it is just like C of 1 comma 1 if I want C of 1 comma 1 so formula says minimum all right K takes the values greater than or equal to 1 but less than 1 so greater than equal to 1 equal to 1 I can take but less than 1 how I can take so I cannot take any K value so the result of a sea of 1 comma 1 s is ego that's where all that it is 0 similarly for 2 2 3 3 4 4 also it is 0 now we will find out difference 1 so here I will write down C of 1 comma 2 so let us find out C of 1 comma 2 this one I am finding so its minimum of let us put it in the formula formula says that k10 take the values starting from 1 but it should be less than 2 so yes K can take only 1 value that is 1 so let us put it if I make K as 1 then what it will be C of 1 comma k k is what 1 K I'm taking it as 1 so 1 C of 1 comma 1 plus C of k plus 1 case what 1 so 2 then J J's what to this is I this is J remember this so 2 2 plus D of I minus 1 is 1 so B 0 into D K that is a d1 into DJ that is d2 with only one K value possible so this is only the value so that itself is minimum so find out what are D 0 D 1 D 2 so D 0 is how much 3 right and D 1 is how much D 1 is a 2 and D 2 is how much D 2 is a 4 then what about C 0 0 already we have it in a table that is the benefit we will get now if you start from smaller values for soldering such formulas this is 0 plus 0 plus this one how much it is two-three-six-six for 34 so the result of 1 comma 2 is 34 so I will write here 24 first time I do I got and for which value of K I got that 24 1 comma 2 here K value K value was 1 so put it as 1 so key of 1 comma 2 is 1 that K value has given us the result now let us find out C of 2 comma 3 cost of 2 comma 3 so here I write score of 2 3 I is 2 and J is 3 so this is minimum of K can take the values starting from 2 but should be less than 3 so only one value that K can take that is 2 so C of I comma k k is what only possible values 2 i comma k plus c of k plus 1 to j j is 3 right then plus dimension of a k minus 1 that is a D 1 into K then jc2 2 we already have it in the table 0 3 3 also 0 plus D 1 D 2 D 3 D 1 D 2 D 3 2 4 2 so two for two so how much this is 0 plus 0 2 4 8 and 8 into 2 16 so this value is 16 so I will land on the value 16 here this is 16 + 4 which value of K we got that as 16 4 K value as a 2 so 2 comma 3 is 2 right now next value C of next is 3 comma 4 okay so I will not explain simply I will write off okay to save your time and my time so here already I have written it so only your time is saved because I have written this one so C of 3 food 3 food so K takes values from 3 to 4 so only 1 K value is possible that is 3 so I have taken K value as 3 so these are the costs plus the dimension so tossed a zero cost is zero and this is 4 into 2 into 5 so that is 4 into 2 into 5 so 5 force 20 in 20 into 2 and that is 40 what is the answer so the cost of 3 4 is how much 40 cost of 3 comma 4 is 44 which value of K we got this K value as a 3 so this is 3 comma 4 is 3 which K value has given so one diagonal is over now next diagonal these 2 values with a difference of 2 so I will remove this and I will find out the values for those 2 so the first one is 1 comma 3 so cost of 1 comma 3 cost of 1 comma 3 formula says that minimum K takes the values greater than equal to 1 and less than 3 right so what are the possible values ki can take K can be 1 and K can be 2 K cannot be 3 because it should be less than 3 so let us try both these K as 1 C is 1 and J is 3 remember this 1 comma 3 you remember this so 1 comma 1 see off 2 to 3 plus D 0 into D 1 into D 3 K value is 1 here you put this in the formula you get this one then here C of 1/2 C of 3 3 plus D 0 into D 2 into D 3 these are the two now what are the values this is 0 1 1 is 0 2 3 C 1 1 is 0 2 3 is 16 16 Plus this has to be added dimensions 0 1 3 0 is a 3 1 is the to 3 years - so how much this is 3 - 6 6 - 12 12 plus 16 s 28 so this is 28 so here I will write on 28 many K is 1 what about this c1 2 c1 2 is 24 this is 24 c3 3 is 0 + D 0 D 2 D 3 D 0 3 4 + 2 so 3 into 4 into 2 3 4 - L to L into 2 24 24 plus 24 this is what he ain't so which one has minimum this one is minimum so what is the value of K K is 1 and it is 28 so CEO of 1 3 is 28 and 4 which value of K we got this one K value is 1 that's it now the next one this one right this is to the for C of 2 - 4 I will write down this and explain you so here C of 2 to 4 K can take the values from 2 to 3 so 2 + 3 so if you put 2 here get this n3 it is this one so what is this let us take them and it's 2 2 2 is 0 & 3 to 4 3 to 4 is how much 40 40 plus dimensions I will right afterwards first let us fill up this C of 2 to 3 C of 2 to 3 is how much is 16 16 plus 0 so this looks a smaller ok let us first put the dimensions of first one right what are the dimensions of this D 1 D 2 D for D 1 D 2 D 4 2 4 5 2 into 4 into 5 what about this d1 d3 d4 2 2 5 so 2 into 2 into 5 how much is this 5 4 is 20 into 2 that is 14 40 80 this is 80 and how much is this - 2 4 4 5 20 and this is 36 this is 36 so this is minimum what is the value of K K is at 3 right so how much is this 36 so 2 comma 4 is 36 and for which value of AK a we got this one K as a 3 so kick ass 3 this is 2 comma 4 is 3 only one value is remaining what is that C of 1 comma 4 so I'll remove this and I will find out C of 1 comma 4 C of 1 comma 4 minimum what are the possible values of K K can take the values from 1 2 less than 4 minutes 3 so K can be 1 K can be 2 and K can be 3 so I will expand these then we will put the values and see the result so here I have taken different K values K 1 and K s 2 and K s T so let us write down the values and get the result C 1 1 is 0 C 2 4 is 36 this is 36 and plus D 0 D 1 D 0 and d 4 C this is a 3 and this is a 5 so this is 3 and this is 5 and in between D 1 is 2 B 1 is 2 and what about this C of 1 2 1 2 is 24 and 3/4 3/4 is how much 40 40 plus these dimensions this is 3 and this is a 5 and in between we have D 2 D 2 is 4 then 1 comma 3 1 comma 3 is 28 28 one gamma-rays 28 this 1 plus 4 comma 4 is 0 Plus this is 3 and this is 5 in between D 3 is there that is true sort of this which is minimum let us check 3 2 6 6 5 30 and this is 36 so this is 86 and this is four fives 20 20 into 360 so this is 101 24 this is 124 and this one is 28 and this is 3 2 6 6 5 30 30 and 28 this is 58 so which value K has a 3 has given us minimum value that is 58 and K as a 3 that's it so I got the table filled based on the formula now this means that cost of multiplying these four matrices of these dimensions minimum cost is 58 imagine if you follow other methods the number of multiplications may be 124 or maybe this is 86 so it is much more than this one this is more than double so if you have a 10 Brandi mattis's and you want to multiply them first of all find out how you should multiply to save your time then start multiplication right so we got that the best method will give you 58 number of multiplications so you have to perform only 58 multiplications for performing multiplication of these four matrices so that is the optimal result a minimal result right now how the parent this ization should be done which should be multiplied first then next what how the multiplication should be done that's what the important task is we want the parent is ization so who will give you the parent station this table will give you the K values will give you so let us find the parent in addition by following this K table right that is s table so I will remove this and I will parenthesize these four mattresses based on this so I have four mattresses that is a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 right now how the parenthesis addition should be done follow this see this is the final answer the final answer I remember this this is 1 comma 4 so when you have 1 2 4 then may the paranthesis addition should be done at a tree at a tree you have to do from one before you have to do parents in a tree so at a tree you put the balances for step algorithm once again so that you can separately see them ok this is a 4 so I have written them once again so this is the first parent is happenin so I have taken once again now this is only one matrix when one more text is there you don't have to worry what about these 3 comma 3 1 comma 3 is how much 1 so parent isolation should be done at 2 1 so this has to be separated then definitely what is left over now this is 2 2 trees left over because you will be multiplying two minuses this is separated like how I have separated this ok I should have put parentheses here also see when it was 1 2 4 again I am showing you so it was said that K is 3 we said that K is 3 so I had the 3 I have separated and that side separated now within this bracket 1 2 3 1 2 3 said that 1 2 3 is 1 so put a bracket at 1 then to do 3 goes on that side no this is complete this is total parenthesis Asia so this means that a 1 should be multiplied with the result of a-two a-three and their result should be multiplied with a four so I will show you diagrammatically so as per the brackets if you see a 2 a 3 are multiplied right these two are multiplied then a 1 is multiplied with this then a 4 is multiplied with this final result so this is how multiplication should be done this should be multiplied with the product of this and this should be multiplied with the product of this that's all so from this table I have done the parentheses ation once again I will show you one to four say is three so put a bracket at the three so from one to three right this is food to four separate then one two three says one two three says put a bracket on one put a bracket one one remaining are two and three so two three is a single product that is two minus S one multiplication right don't have to check further so if you check this is 2 comma 3 then you will get 2 only so this says that put a bracket like this like this ok so don't have to do it further if you are doing also you will get the brackets like this so this or the multiplication should be done all right so that's all about the example problem no if you are interested in knowing how much time it will take for finding out the parenthesis ation of matte exchange multiplication how much time it has taken so I have filled the table right that table and this one how many values are there in that one so if you come from here 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 so it means 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 so this is nothing but 4 into 5 by 2 for n mattis's it will be n into n plus 1 by 2 so the time taken for filling that is n square but how I am getting each value so if you consider this 158 I tried all possible values of K and I got that one so key is taken the values from I to J so let us assume that is all so and so that value is not just computed in a so that value is computed by taking different K values so let us say n values we are taking so it is into n n square into n so it is n cube and we can say this is upper bound we can say upper bomb Big O and cube so at most n cube that is the meaning because K is not always taking n value so if you want to go in detail analysis and take all possible values of KS and check it thoroughly also it may be somewhat less than n cube so let us say upper bound is ng so that's all about maddux chain multiplication problem that's all in this video"

wonder what number we're at it's right over your head right now okay yeah don't worry about it you'll you'll know about the number later kids costume party cancer ah it's a dog I forgot it was an animal video San Francisco [Music] yo the funniest video on the internet right now I need someone to tell me that personally oh my God he pulled up what the heck was that an inchworm a real life inchworm look it's inching he's inch into the metal this is sick there's just no way that guy's a genius that guy is going places jail probably crab is this the underwater crab everything evolves to crab [Music] holy crime in shock what is that crabs swim bro what is that that's a lot more on my face that's a llama Mama Is that real you know what else is real that number above your head it's getting big you keep saying number but I don't know what you mean big number is this a laughs bro is that not fun it was you got a good laugh out loud man trust her look at me whoa he was excited no he was nervous a zebra [Applause] I never would have thought in a million years a zebra sounded like that yeah I used to yell out the window animals are just like this first rip rap Ed [Laughter] oh why his face look like that oh my God he's like I had uh look at that kitty cat sit what is that ice cream oh butter on the dog yo you better not get my burger oh he went for the whole thing he does look very trustwise hi all right so what is this animal that's causing so much distress it's a raccoon it's a trash Panda inside God I love raccoons what is he doing I'm not supposed to have one as a

      "corpus": "today I bought every band item in America that we can get our hands on some of these products were from the 90s before I was born but they were discontinued recalled or banned for a specific reason let's dive into it starting off with the iconic Easy Bake Oven this was a huge part of my childhood pretty much taught kids how to actually bake it actually came with real ingredients with a real oven for you to cook and actually eat as a kid I know myself as a kid I always wanted to cook but my mom wouldn't let me so this is what it was made for so easy bake actually came out in 1963 but it wasn't until the 2006 version that something went horribly wrong for them to ban it and this is the exact one we got our hands on so many children actually got injured from this product because they would burn themselves and one incident that happened is a girl got her finger caught in the oven door and she had to amputate her finger so they recalled over 900 000 of these Easy Bake Ovens but dude this is so nostalgic look at this yeah I wonder if it's actually gonna work look at that you literally put the food in there let it cook I don't think I could actually eat this because whatever it came with is probably expired oh it comes with mints that's cool I low-key don't know if this is supposed to come with it or the person we bought this from just threw these I think that's what happened so back in 2006 you can get your hands on one of these bad boys for 25 but we actually had to pay 127 just to get our hands on it because it is banned so it's hard to find this is what you put the food in stick it straight into the oven no do you think it's gonna work no the basic beginning set real baking tools to use with your Easy Bake Oven a little whisk bro what so sadly it didn't come with any of the baking ingredients I mean it would make sense why because this is from 2006 and it was used but we're just gonna see if it actually still turns on oh there it is the light turned on I think this is what kids would get their fingers stuck in I would be the type to injure myself right now bro we do smell that it's actually on it smells old it smells like old cookies were baked in here so it actually still does work I wish we had the baking mix to actually make something I probably wouldn't have tried it but would have been cool to see it cook but guys nowadays Easy Bake made an updated version a safer version and it's good to know that they're still going from launching from 1963. they still have their brand 60 years later next product we have our blow pens every time I'd be watching SpongeBob this commercial would play these came out in 1995 and the reason they got discontinued was simply due to the fact that people just wanted to draw regularly with their hands and not load through a marker that's what the product does you pretty much draw by blowing into the pen obviously you would think that it got discontinued because it was dangerous but as you can see up here it says it's washable and non-toxic we're gonna open these up I think it comes with a stencil this is what they look like no way I have this in my hands we got a flower stencil right here so this is how you set it up so it's ready to use you pop this open you take this out and you can see it's like a regular marker but you're going to want to turn it put it in this way and you lock it in like that and this is where you blow from so let's see if it works a little bit came out no weights this hard I don't know if I don't know if the product is old but if it was really this hard back in the day to do it I could see why no one wanted to do this let me try another one I'm about to pass out guys I kind of want to see if I draw out the marker if it's still there yeah like it still works all right guys I finally figured out how to do it after practicing so here we go perfect yo this is actually sick that it still works all right you ready to see it oh this is sick what Loki gives off a sick aesthetic look at that how fire is that okay I love this product I don't know how the hype died down I thought it was fire but let's move on to the next product the next one is Altoids Tangerine sours these were my childhood candy everyone in my school would have these they were really wildly popular and as you can see on the back they were 1.69 and this one was specifically an O3 but they got discontinued the reason for that is that they were really popular yet they had very low sales we were able to get our hands on them you could buy them for 1.69 back then we got them for 200 so that just shows how hard it is to get your hands on them we're gonna open it up right here I remember they always used to be stuck to each other in the can so I wonder 20 years of them being in this pack how it's gonna look I know guys I'm not gonna eat them and yes guys I know I look like nectar from Despicable Me right now I get it look at that bro you could already see like it has like goo it's like slimy oh my gosh bro no way it still smells like them low-key yo wait look at how melted this is yo we're gonna pop up a picture of what they're actually supposed to look like the fact that I could still smell them is so nostalgic to me bro so what's crazy is these were hard candies but have you guys ever seen hard candy melt I'd understand if it was like a gummy worm or gummy bear would be melted but a hard candy I guess maybe because it's been 20 years I don't know let me know what you guys think next item we have is the Hannah Montana Pop Star card game and this got completely banned due to the amount of lead that was in these cards there is 75 times more lead in these cards than the legal limit which caused them to get banned how do cards have that much lead for those who don't know lead is a toxic metal that can actually lead to death so the fact that you can possibly die by playing a card game is crazy I'm just wearing gloves just in case all right this is it the pop star card game don't get me wrong Hannah Montana was literally my biggest crush of all time but this product is deadly bro never even heard about these cards when I was a huge Hannah Montana fan we got Jackson as the choker Hannah Lily and then wait where's Rico where's my twin bro he better be in this game Montana as if he wasn't an important character that disrespect is crazy bro so these are the actual cards right here there's a lot of trivia I guarantee you bro I will get a lot of these right the name of the custodian at Miley's Middle School who customizes Jake Ryan's Locker is Tony yeah okay if you're a fan of Hannah Montana back in the day I feel like there's a pretty solid card game but since they disrespected my boy Rico and they didn't have him in here I don't like this game so this was the Barbie rollerblade Edition that released in early 1991 and got banned in late 1991. it didn't even last one year before they banned it from the dangers that this doll caused you can even tell from the box look at how old that is bro it kind of has like a yellow tint to it do you see it up to 10 rebate details inside offer expires 1993. so it didn't even make it to that the reason it actually got banned is that you can actually create Sparks from the blades it was a danger Hazard for burning little kids or starting a fire hopefully we don't start a fire out here I'm excited to see if it actually works I don't even want to damage the Box because it's from 1991. this is it what does this say it says allow four to six weeks for your skates to arrive then let the good times roll again oh after a short period of time the skates lose their Sizzle you could actually order a new pair of skates that's pretty cool these are it right here let's try it out do you see any Sparks no I'm gonna try doing it with just one skate it's like lighting a match bro oh I feel a little bit no way yeah I saw one I didn't even see it see that okay I can definitely see why they got banned because they were literally causing actual Sparks this is surge which is pretty much Coca-Cola's version of Mountain Dew but the reason it got discontinued is that it just didn't do well and could not compete with the real Mountain Dew I don't think anything can Top Mountain Dew surge tried many ways of trying to stay relevant stay popping they did a collab with Amazon Burger King but it just didn't hit they just ended up discontinuing the whole thing and now that I'm reading the back of this it says there's 56 grams of sugar bro that is wildly unhealthy I personally have never even tried surge I remember seeing them try to promote it I always used to buy stuff that I'd seen commercials but this one for some reason I just didn't want to buy so we all know Serge got discontinued but no you know what's not discontinued what chug rug oh okay see like I was supposed to make it in the Chug rub can but I just suck well I want to smell it now wait it literally smells exactly like Mountain Dew but guys this is the perfect time for you to try chug rug or any other G fuel flavor because they are running the spring buy one get one free sale check out the link in the description G fuel spring BOGO so this book right here is called the 48 Laws of Power this isn't banned in America it's just banned throughout the entire prison system in America so no one in prison no one in jail can ever get their hands on this the reason to that is because this book teaches people how to manipulate others you don't want a prisoner wanting to learn that because they can manipulate the guards or other prisoners I want to read you guys some of the chapters because they're kind of crazy one of them says make other people come to you use bait if necessary I mean that's highly manipulative play on people's need to believe to create a cult-like following bro what is this book dude I mean I totally understand why we don't want this in prisoner's hands get others to do the work for you but always take the credit what bro this this is scary man how is this even a good book for you to read in general just morally mentally I don't know why you'd want to learn how to be manipulative because manipulative people are literally the scariest people on planet Earth this is the cabin Dairy Cream Egg and you will never find an authentic version of these in America as these were imported from the UK the reason these were banned in America is because Hershey's filed a lawsuit against them because of how similar these were to an already existing Hershey's chocolate egg but if you're from the UK you've probably seen these all over since they're not expired I can actually give this one a try I'm really excited well look at the filling these are fired what the heck the only thing is I haven't seen Hershey's drop a similar chocolate to this at all on the topic of chocolate we have the Kinder Surprise egg which was banned in 1997. and in fact it was so hard for us to get our hands on it the only version we could get is the Spanish version straight from Mexico this actually got banned because it was a choking hazard for kids in the egg they would put a plastic toy in there and some kids wouldn't know that so they put the whole egg in their mouth and try to swallow it and actually choked on the toy we're gonna open this one up I think one of the first chocolates I've ever eaten in my life my parents brought it from Jordan it was Kinder but it was just like the OG Kinder bars and we would always refrigerate them okay no you want some no wow dude they're cute man you could hear the toy in there I'm opening it up there it is right there but I guess the toys in here definitely a cool concept though what is this you could build a snowman Bro Look at that all right we built my snowman and now taste test really good this game X-Men Destiny was released in 2011 and banned in 2014. so there were some legal issues going on between two game companies and funny enough one of those companies was epic games due to all that drama all that beef they ended up destroying every last copy of X-Men Destiny except the few that people actually had at their house so so I'm holding one of the very last few copies of this game just imagine all the literal Blood Sweat and Tears put into creating a new video game and just three years later it got taken away from you due to just some legal issues I can't even imagine that feeling I personally have never played this game but it's on the Wii we have a plane over here I actually wanted to play the game but supposedly you need like Wii nunchucks to even start the game so we were able to get the loading screen going but it's such a shame that this went to waste this I actually remember it's called a Sky Dancer and it was released in 1994 but got banned in 2000 for some severe reasons I personally remember the commercials we're gonna have it playing right now so pretty much you just pull this right here and it starts spinning and it launches but due to the dangers of it hitting people's face it caused temporary blindness to some people and people having to get stitches which is absolutely crazy causing Sky Dancers to get completely banned from America and they have to recall 9 million units here we go imma launch it damn yo that's still sick though but I could see how dangerous it could be for kids I don't know if you guys seen this video of a young girl opening this for Christmas and she launched it into their own fireplace I could see how that could be addicting I feel like this is fun but at the end of the day safety comes first so for this water rocket this isn't the exact one that got banned in 1997. it was only on the market for three months April 1997 to July 1997. the real one that got banned was actually even almost impossible to find a picture on Google from it that's how short-lived it was it was extremely dangerous because it would launch into people's eyes and the plastic was super weak that when they fill it up with a hose it would explode and all the plastic pieces would cut people's faces for this specific one right here it literally says not recommended for children under eight years old always aim rocket so it is launched straight up never pointed at people or buildings and also it says made from high-tech shatter resistant plastic because obviously of the original one they decided to take more safety precautions these are the three pieces we have I'm excited to see how high it actually launches because supposedly it says right here it could launch up to 100 feet but I doubt it I think that's cap first things first to get the water in the rocket it comes with this funnel and we're gonna try to make it launch a hundred feet we got the safety goggles on just in case we have the pump and we are going to lock it in just like that now it's locked in and now it says to pump at about 20 to 25 times and then I pull this lock ring and it's supposed to shoot up 100 feet in the air one two look at that three four five six seven eight it's creating bubbles ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen Seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty I'm just gonna do that twenty Ready Set that was like 20 feet what the heck guys pump the like button just as much as I'm pumping this water rocket this one's gonna go high all right I would say shot up to like 20 25 feet I think that's a cool product but definitely could see how the old one could shatter when you're pumping and actually injure people all right guys for the last band product we have the Cabbage Patch Kids snack time and as you can see I'm in a whole different outfit because this took way longer than any band product we found just because of how hard it was to find this was actually launched in 1996 and banned one year later in 1997 because this Cabbage Patch Kid actually eats like it moves its mouth it has a mechanic that eats toys right here it says fun snacks you could feed it but the problem was that kid's hair was getting caught in the jaw of the Cabbage Patch Kid and it just would not stop chewing leading to the parent having to cut the hair and other injuries so that's pretty crazy I mean it literally says right here for ages over three years but sadly it didn't last too long it's just crazy knowing I have a box here from 1996. we got this set up we had to put two C batteries in there and it actually still works look at this if it detects something it just starts chewing look at how creepy that looks I feel like this is gonna haunt me after this video we're gonna get some of the food it came with let's get some french fries you know you hungry so she'll chew they actually fall in her backpack once it's done I mean it's a really great concept of a toy back in the 90s of course but obviously if it's dangerous it's not good no way hold up it's right here dude that's actually sick so we got a wig right here this toy was made for children over three so you would imagine a kid at that age would like put their finger in her mouth or something and then once they get the mouth moving if they accidentally get their hair caught in that as you can see it's pulling the hair look at that your hair is now stuck to where your parent would have to just cut your hair and that's what caused it to be bam look at that like it's genuinely stuck oh that's awful that is awful guys comment down below which band product you thought was the most interesting and I will see you all with the next video peace"

      "corpus": "[Music] this is some of my early animation and when I made it this was the best I could do at the time but it would be fair to say now that this is probably some of my worst animation so I dug up all these old animations that I did I'll react to them and then I'm gonna Crown one of them as the worst and of course some of my very earliest animations were flip books so first I went to my parents house and grabbed a few of my old flip books here's how that went [Music] and a quick pit stop to fuel up and there's my parents house hi Mom hi Dad [Music] here's something okay so these are some of the flip books that I made when I was a kid and there's a few specific ones in here that I'm going to grab and bring back with me and we'll leave the rest here [Music] oh I heard that noise again okay I've got some flip books from my parents house I grabbed a few newer ones as well now I don't want to do this just to like go through my old stuff and just make fun of it um because I genuinely love these flip books and I remember the feeling that I had when I made these flip books just kind of that feeling of like excitement and magic of seeing this thing come to life and move around the page first these are not ones from when I was a kid I did a video a while back called ugly flip books really though like I wouldn't I wouldn't call these my worst animation because there's a difference between ugly and bad and these are ugly on purpose so I I don't know I love the other glue flip books I'm gonna do a video another video soon where I do more ugly flipbooks this one this is one of the earliest flip books I remember making I know I've shown this before on my channel and it's very hard to flip because it was just like cut out paper on flippability scale one to ten this is like a oh maybe a two so the idea was I was making this guy flip over in the air and then land as far as animation goes that one is definitely a front runner for worst animation but again I I love it because this was the style of person that I always Drew basketball jumps through and you know I think it'd be easy for someone to look at this and just kind of not give it much credit because a kid made it and it's not quote unquote professional but I just can't help but loving it anyway because it was fun and that's kind of what it's all about I think but if I'm really having to scrutinize and award one of these flip books the title of worst um this is not going to be easy [Music] this is not one from when I was a kid I did this on for a tick tock and I just wanted to intentionally make an animation that was like really stupid looking and so this is that one so I guess you could call that my worst animation but it was intentional so then really it did what it was supposed to do all right if I'm looking at all these that's not all the flip books from when I was a kid of course just a little handful um worst animation I would almost go with this one but because it was intentional to look like that I think everyone kind of gets disqualified I'm gonna have to go with this one as much as I genuinely love it the flipbook is very hard to flip and the animation well speaks for itself so that one I proudly award the title best worst flipbook all right let's switch gears I pulled up a bunch of old stop motion I was basically learning to animate on the job like I had I had done a bit of stop-motion as a kid not a lot started working at this little Animation Studio they gave me the chance to just learn to animate see if perhaps my computer will open this file you'll notice um we were using the I was using the app animator DV professional 9.0 demo we were too cheap to spend the fifty dollars to buy the full version so I have all my early animation tests are like have these lines and this watermark on it uh yeah I didn't want to spend the 50 bucks so this was my first test with an Armature so it I mean it looks like someone's first animation with an Armature it's rough but it's like I don't know that's just kind of what you do you just start moving it and like figuring it out this is Bob [Music] made him look like he was kind of whimpering and getting sad third one I think I was imagining like a I don't know a big animal or a bear or something like coming up to him you know comes up to his side and he looks up [Music] it's weird looking at it at it now how not smooth it it was and that like then when I was doing the test and taking the frames it was like I thought it was fine this one's called sneeze [Music] [Music] that face is pretty good right there yeah so I like that one it's it's um it's funny I don't know if here I was like I will try to walk the puppet and then got like one step in and was like nope let's just do something else every shot you do you're learning something and you're practicing and you start to kind of build a like a muscle memory and so I don't know I guess for like up and coming or aspiring animators as you start to animate it's fine if it looks bad for a while you just will get better the more you do it oh there's more Bob I think [Music] kind of like this one and again still have not paid for animator DV film producer still using the demo version with the watermark on it which is kind of uh stupid this one has sound I took this little sound clip from Monty Python search for the Holy Grail now go away or I shall taunt you a second timer uh which the greatest moments in the movie we'll see here you can see that like I wasn't quite sure what what the idea like there was not really a clear idea in what I was doing with the posing like if I were to do this shot again I would go I would try to think of like what is the one idea that I'm going for in the pose and how can I show that in the most simple effective way possible let's see oh [Music] why do you think I have these outrageous Accenture silly King [Music] this was a little character called lug dance now there's a lot more stuff here than I thought this one's probably in the running for worst this is supposed to be a legitimate walk so let's see see how good this actually is okay better than better than that other one oh there you can see so um I've got fishing lines suspending him up in the air [Music] another attempt at a jump either the work day ended or I just gave up I forgot I had all this anyway it's all very rough but the more I did it the more I just got better and smoother at all of it you just you just get better the more you do it okay so here's here's an early shot that I did that like it's not smooth but but I was having a lot of fun with the performance yeah see he's like leaning way too far over he would he would be like falling over I should have just shifted that foot but I was having a lot of fun with the the performance and the and the acting and everything working on the movie animating every day by the end of that project I had some like pretty good animation under my belt and really like getting into the performances that was like such a fun part of it is just getting into the acting and I really liked that okay so we finished that project then went on to another short movie and these were some pre-production tests I did with one of the characters uh I've definitely improved by this point it's a lot better than my my first stuff with Bob that's pretty fun excited about something okay so those were test animations during pre-production and now this was actually from the opening scene of the movie I remember really I don't know just kind of like being really excited about this opening scene and then later in the movie there was this Cemetery set that I just thought was so cool you can see my walking has improved by this point [Music] [\u00a0__\u00a0] the haunted castle Katie what are we going to do so yeah I feel like from the beginning until now you can see like there was a lot of improvement it really was just it was like just animating every day and doing it and um it was just it was such a cool opportunity to work at that studio and to just get to get to to work on a couple actual projects and then through that was able to get good enough and build up a demo reel that was good enough that then was able to go on to you know working on feature films and things like that okay judging time of my early stop motion which one will I Crown the worst for the runner-up I'm gonna go with this one because I I feel like it was supposed to be a normal walk and just fell apart but I still like it because it makes me laugh and for the one I'm gonna Crown the worst I think I've got to go with this one because yeah but again I kind of don't really like picking a worse because really all of these to me represent experimenting and learning and growing uh but thanks for going on this little uh Journey with me down memory lane and I guess take away that's kind of what it is is um you know sometimes people ask me like what do you recommend for learning to animate and where do I go to school and things like that so much of it is just really just animating like every day and you just naturally just get better and better it's just like playing the piano or an instrument you just get better until eventually it just kind of becomes second nature and you're not thinking so hard about this principle or that principle it just you just kind of naturally do it all right that's it let me know if you had a a favorite or a least favorite uh what you guys think and if you have any questions please leave those down below I'd love to hear your your questions and your thoughts and um okay see you guys in the next one now go away or I shall taunt you a second timer"

am dear Riley if you're reading this it means you won't see me again look for a tape but no that once you watch it there's no turning back often into dark oh this has got to have something for us no way there's nothing on this board we need to read that looks important and really scary tape found the tape probably should have done this first we're gonna play it what does it say s hi I'm Brianna [Music] we're going to make an apple sounds yummy Peach okay that's not what we're making pecan oh no them that sounds delicious shoot it we're going to make an apple pie that's not what I said we need to cut the apples do you know what we can use to cut the apples um it really is like Dora the Explorer I don't think we're supposed to do that by ourselves why it's always good too you're by yourself what to a certain degree uh don't do that that's not good that doesn't seem safe you're right woolly oh we have almost everything we need did they cut the apples they look fully put together still the neighbor's house ah um okay there's a picture of a pie on the fridge so maybe it's stuck if you want to help me girl you need instructions on where to store Sugar I thought she was saying an option to find the sugars in the oven when the whole time the cabinet was right here cinnamon I wish it's great okay it's time to bake a pie all right let's bake it preheat the oven I'm not sure Lily 425. preheat the oven to 400. don't forget that number all right easy put it in the oven for 40 minutes for 40 minutes 4 25 for 40 minutes bye all right so I did see an oven and a timer so what if we bro that oven was not there earlier we have to remember how to make this pie so we're going to turn on the oven it was four 25. we're gonna cook it for 40 minutes gotta get oh that's a strawberry we want apples we're gonna cut the apple and put it in there do we just literally put this flimsy Apple in here we're gonna see what happens that's not how you make a pie guys I think we're missing some ingredients oh whoa that was cool all right Aunt Kathy or whatever your name is I'm doing this for you [Music] you introduced yourself earlier what am I supposed to answer okay I like that there are so many friends in my neighborhood today I want to send something special to my friend all right you know where the store is so all of these are stores but I guess we're gonna buy the card at the corner store thank you what kind of card should I send them a sad card or now you're happy so now you're happy so she's happy now it's not their birthday oh oh oh that's that's right I found the perfect card my big brain for the next time do nice things it's important to think with bread I want to get my friend only a loaf of bread hopefully where can I buy a treat from my friend we're just gonna eat our feelings get some bread tree everything smells so good Chef has seen better days I want to buy my friends some cookies can you show me where the cookies are why did it glitch like that and everything looked really creepy all of a sudden I mean this is a cookie so tasty oh my gosh the package is ready for my friend they live pretty far from me oh we need to send it wow it's getting late most of the stores are closed we probably can't send that now I have to send this to my friend you can make it to your friend to go to the Post Office guys sorry your name is don't remember that's a bad friend do you help me we can come back tomorrow why would I know your friend's name send that now no I have to send this to my friend I don't know who your friend is package need to go to uh Dora no that's not my friend's name why would I know your friend's name Sarah you have to know their name how Jessica um what's another name that starts is it a boy or a girl I Jess I y'all I didn't type whatever just showed up on the screen I'm not kidding I I really don't know what just was typed on my computer okay guys so I noticed something and I made a weird like when I noticed it there were bolded letters on each store in that little tape we just washed it was c b and F so that's gotta be what this is for right [Music] nice oh no accidents why is the tape named that that makes me feel uncomfortable all right Amanda do your best to make us happy [Music] what happened oh Lily had an accident that's why it's called that accident is when something bad happens [Music] just tell me what happened it can happen in your house at school at the playground yeah you can get her almost everywhere we were playing tripped and fell oh no look like he got her his knee excited about that help when you are hurting me doctor I'm shocked I got that right which room [Music] I don't know if you know this about me but before I was a YouTuber I was an emergency room nurse so I've got this I know what it looks like when you break a book give Willy let's do it it hurts 's injury hold on the heart monitor the X-ray machine or at the scale Amanda just told bully there's not a doctor around that they're not there so I'm getting mixed signals also guys I'm gonna write this down so at the beginning of this she said they were playing at 3 45 I believe and that's when he woolly hurt his knee and then I wrote down 22.50 because I feel like that could be important we have a heart monitor scale and we're going to want to use the X-ray machine here yes let's see the bones wait that's all I wanted to do more medical stuff please hit that subscription button and we can help save wooly because I don't think he's in a good situation now we have a clock I knew this would happen so we have a couple options here we're gonna try 345 as our first option do any of you if you could still time anymore I feel like it's only on like phones and stuff so when I was little you would actually have to learn how to do this but I don't feel like you'll probably do anymore 345. yes mission in this game or I was wrong and it's just alarming there's more to this puzzle all right here's a clock I did write down 22.50 which is technically 10.50 there all right let's retrace our steps there was one place there was a clock that we didn't mention it was right in front of the doors with the bones the heart and the mouth so it's gotta be that time which I believe was we'll see that sounds right satisfying here we go yes that's gotta be the last clock right there's no way there's more clocks help things are off the cork board that were there when we first started tick tock tick tock catching up with Sam wait Sam I don't know who you are but you're a beautiful man I have a key do I just shove it in here ah that didn't seem correct um stab it that thing's evil all right so I actually don't know that this is a key it kind of looks like a dagger or part of a clock were any of the clocks around us missing hand oh there is another clock all right well we've replaced that I noticed this clock over here had change times this is not the time we had said what like 10 50 or something on this before but now it says 5 15 so I'm assuming that is the last code we need for the next tape gotta be this clock reminds me of when I was little we used to have one of these house all right yes guys we have big brains look at what we have done together safe eight to six don't forget that eight two six safe [Music] I love you wooly that's me huh what's your favorite food to eat at a picnic I'm assuming it's apples I don't like that at all wait you liked apple pie what's that smell ew I've never smelled anything like that that doesn't sound good I don't know Willie what yeah oh what do you think is making that bad smell well wooly is a sheep so maybe you know he just smells like a sheep like an animal that's not his fault be you oh we have to point at something there's apples cupcakes and this what is this is that a diaper thank you this tree stump is body too oh cool they are not alive anymore why is she talking about this uh wooly I'm looking at you looking at me looking at you looking at me and I don't feel good about saying this opposite of alive is that that's right yep that's right it's dead dead and opposite of alive this is what happened to our aunts that's never good thank you wooly please distract her [Music] body I can't do this what do you think guys I don't if you don't know me at all I have the biggest heart for animals and I hate this so much he's by the bush I'm just gonna say the berries okay we're just gonna click and not look at stuff it wasn't that oh my head it's funny you did Amanda woolly I don't think it was you 'd be nice if he could tell us yeah bring him back to life I'm missing something the berries oh this didn't even know what got him until it was too late I don't like that Amanda this is going too far thank you talk some sense into her yeah we did sandwich [Music] Mr buff this is the worst picnic I've ever been to in my entire life why Amanda get some water it feels far away oh [Music] no what do you mean plastic answer my question you don't have to no not everything rots uh wait what would I say to this do you think everything rots no and yes do not fit in these bars no see everything is fine here that I didn't say what they wanted everything's fine wooly is not fine okay now we're moving and I'm not doing anything we're looking at scary doll what was that it's siren head a demigorgon I'm I'm done for I'm gonna get eaten I know we died but we're back and look this Dilly bobber's back remember we got a code 826 to open a lock box but at that point it was still a cardboard box I don't really understand how this happened and who has been how about this yes what do we have here oh all right a note red orange blue but wait there was a paper over here on the bulletin board with those weird symbols on it can we join it on okay so it's some sort of color code and also it says potato and potato is not a color but you should put a potato Emoji in the comments [Music] um what is this a jelly bean this is a medicine this goes to a clock wait there was part of the TV kind of sparking I wonder if this is like a cap see the little Sparks here plug oh wait it's the pause button okay now we can pause these crazy videos maybe we can can find something we weren't noticing before here let's watch the video see if there's anything new now that we have respawned I think we played through all the first challenges today we're going to make an apple pie all right first we need to cut the Apple let's cut some apples do you know what we can use to cut the apples guys pause pause that oven was not like that before it is burning hot with a pause button over it so I think that means we need to go turn on the oven we have paused the game we're going to turn the oven on to what was it 425 right all right I turn the oven on the tape moved yo this is not where we paused what is happening there was not a fire before what I'm what that's all we got okay oh okay the oven moved there's now cheese and meat pie meat that's vague what kind of meat are we talking we need a potato a mushroom and meat preheat the oven to 525 in a pie tin mix with meat potato and mushroom bake for 50 minutes and enjoy all right let's preheat 525 right uh so I mean we have the cheese put that in the pan so we just need meat and a mushroom oh the mushroom was over here all right we have cheese we have mushroom now we need meat I refuse to harm a creature where am I supposed to get this meat from huh we don't even need cheese why did I put cheese in here what is this cheese for cheese get out she's literally stop you're ruining everything what is this oh this has a symbol like that's over here oh potato was a symbol it's a moon get that back I don't care about that oh what was that one we don't care about it I'm not here for that trash get it out of here there we go so remember there's dripping water I'm assuming that this means that potato seed is in this pot where was the water again there water it oh it's already growing I know what I have to do guys I'm a vegetarian in Minecraft and I love animals so much this is just what I have to do for the game and I'm so sorry no I hated the sound poor precious no baby I'm sorry I don't want to look at you oh I'm not eating him that is so sad now we just need the potato and this part can be over how do we get it out though do I put the pot in there all right guys I think we have all the ingredients we just have to cook it for 50 minutes this is gonna be delicious I would have rather just eaten cheese well hey looks like we got our next tape we have not seen this one yet it's called in your neighborhood wait we have seen this one but is anything different about it I'm a little nervous there I'm Amanda and I'm Lily a butcher Amanda maybe some

all right I don't remember this before where we went we tried to you took me what all I know is this is where we went first the 24-oh okay there's an arrow it's a good sign so that's where we went first and then we went from there where to the candy store and then from there to the butcher now I think we have to guess which each one symbolizes so I'm thinking this one is the First Choice then candy then yes okay this one this one guts okay guys we have a new word to use with some sort of lock it's guts and then it says cut off of doll's head that's disturbing let's just try to find a lock this one Maybe no those are numbers so we need guts Sarah what about this one hey u t guts oh [Music] so this is disturbing at the end of that little beautiful page here it has scissors with that doll being killed so unfortunately I know the doll is right over here well had been y'all that that doll had just been right over here right am I crazy what is in here all right let's see what this says we have scissors and a new tape there we go what do we have hi friends [Music] because he is a sheep wow can you make a sound like a sheep wow yeah sound just like me severe thunderstorm warning emergency alert system there are lots of animals here to pet and play with wait hold on there's just some sort of tornado alert should we be worried I spin meal was not here before did the alarm go off literally for this thunderstorm or tornado I I don't know I guess we're gonna click it and find out is that bad um we've got a thunderstorm what happens now okay so I spun the wheel and got a big thunderstorm so hopefully that'll protect us I don't know it's fun to spend time with animals they are very different from people it's true they look different and they don't talk like people Amanda true I'm an animal dumb talk silly rude look at these signs let's make sounds like the animals oh no are you ready I'm ready beautiful a chicken says you can get Chuckles from freemers.com [Music] okay I don't think I needed to click off there that just scared me do you have a family animals have families I think I should tell her let's go see one of the animal family I want to see the chicken hmm you show me where the chickens are assume towards the chicken thing having a family is nice I see a mommy chicken oh baby chicken cute and I see Daddy oh look at the chickens are those frogs do you know what the daddy is called a dad chicken dad daddy chick oh oh tornado warning guys pause I think we need to to spin the wheel again and make sure we get a thunderstorm that's the only thing I know to do I think whenever it says a tornado is coming yep that helped save us pretty sure now that we got thunderstorm instead of tornado I think we can watch again sure [Music] thank you Amanda eat their babies okay well that was messed up why is the barn breathing it's time to visit the Sheep guys I don't know wooly looks concerned I love wooly so we're gonna go towards snakes I don't want to see those they're scary well you're bullying wooly oh fine then we'll go see spiders flooding warning okay we're gonna pause again I feel like we need to spin the wheel again you're gonna spin the wheel I don't know what's gonna happen is it gonna make the flood go away hopefully that prevented the flood I don't know okay slowly family they're so cute yeah he's back to normal oh no [Music] pause recommends that you remain calm and don't um I think we just have to keep making sure oh it was still on thunderstorm I think we would have been okay am I a little kitten where is your family love on him it looks like this kitten is all by herself how do you think she feels [Music] sad alone [Music] of course I will yes what is that face for what is happening back there [Music] guys are facial expression I just got chills I was asked to save a kitten I said yes then all the Sheep started making noise and everything paused okay guys I think I missed something I think we're gonna have to re-watch this pause it and spin the wheel anytime an alarm pops up essentially okay severe thunderstorm warning so now that that's there so I'm Gonna Roll this it didn't do that last time that was creepy all right now it's on tornado okay so now we're gonna play this again and then pause it next alert that comes up funny films no that's not what they're called try pause we have a tornado warning so now it's time to spin the wheel I think this is looking good so far a tornado goes to creepy so we should only need one more spin I think yeah whatever that is I guess a blizzard I think it's time to visit the Sheep no okay no I'm on woolly side and he doesn't want us to we're not going to do this to wooly flood warning one last roll hopefully this will do it ladies and gents I'll do it are we gonna be lucky oh a spider crawled out of that that was creepy but we got a tape there we go everything rots we're on to this one hi again I'm woolly [Music] you think is making that bad smell I don't know is it is it you Amanda it's you oh that looks fine I pointed to you what about these are you doing this on purpose no Amanda are you doing this on purpose it is making that that's you oh whoa whoa whoa that looks like a heart in like an intestine or something well it did not look like this before did you see that you know what the opposite of alive is you're look at the tree some if it's not alive what is it no you're that oh when an animal dies it rots too it looks like this kitten is in big trouble we'll save him die before anyone wait no for real I hate that yes that actually legit bothers me yes guys guys yo save the cat did I save the cat I clicked on the cat did I save the cat what's this something moved I think the trap doors open oh this doesn't look good I don't think I'm supposed to be here I'm not a piece of me am I a piece of meat currently I literally think I turned into like brisket or something this happened before I think there's only one more round until we can fully suss this out okay so like the other times we have died we have come back but some things have changed what I'm gonna first do is look in this toolbox see if there's still a tape in it um what was this good I think there open cool so we still have the tape but we didn't use the scissors last time so I'm wondering oh yeah because we're gonna use it like on the doll like the the little book showed us to do but the doll was gone now it's back oh that felt weird I'm sorry doll that's just what I was instructed to do okay that's what I was supposed to do okay there's no way that we're supposed to do that for nothing I mean is there something to me oh she had AAA batteries in her head there's a few things around here we haven't used like this robot who I don't think had power oh well where do I put the batteries in the back there we go I knew it that's it I am yeah yeah it's gonna be really fun okay two two I don't know talk to me robot maybe another time what's that mean I remember there was a code in the neighborhood earlier and I never wrote it down because I didn't think we would need it but I think we may it was in the convenience store let's play it 1503 and 25 cents try 15 oh three two five lift off send my condolences to Kate Katie wait why is this this is only being told I feel oh is the TV broken let's watch it let's see if something changed I don't want to play anymore right now oh that's it all right okay a cake this is beautiful is it happy birthday is this for woolly remember it's supposed to be wooley's birthday congratulations you're one year older wishing you the bestest year yet there's a Code zero eight one or it's zero eight eight two or it's zero eight one eight two one maybe we put it in the robot again zero eight one okay oh [Music] yes sir so we're gonna put this big cake in this oven so 325 oops 325 for 30 minutes wait what am I what am I putting in there maybe just use it as a timer oh whoa it spits something out it's bit out a candle and it spit out may your year be filled with many blessings love blabot okay one times four five minus one oh all right so we have to do some math so 1 times 4 is 4. 5 minus one is four one times one plus one equals two one divided by one is one one plus one plus one is three um and then one minus one is zero I hope I did the math right [Music] what what's in the card is on the cake the candle I feel like we need this candle right what's in the card is on the cake we put the candle there I'm thinking two candles are on the cake so that means this candle icon is two here two times four which is eight five minus two which is three two times two which is four plus one which is five two divided by two which is one right two plus two is four plus two is six and then two minus one is one I hope this is right math c c d c c d c f e c c d c f e yes I got another candle oh it's melting [Music] the cake is totally melting another there's another tape I literally have chills okay so that person turned three whoever that was congratulations I'm gonna take this oh no accidents tape and watch it because it just came out of the cake I don't have much time oh you trust me yes yes [Music] when a friend has an accident sometimes nobody can help them but we can try I'm fine see look at me is good oh our Lily is so confused we need to help him well he's fine we have to know what is wrong nothing his knee was hurt earlier yeah you could be wrong um his head Lily's head is broken all right prepare Amanda no he doesn't need your help no don't drink it I don't know Amanda no don't do it just pretend isn't it Lily oh no he's gonna die no wooly you should have known I need to operate immediately my goodness none of them I just like really don't want to do any of this um we're gonna use this that might be but there's only two other choices we're this one things could get really messy if we use that okay but it won't if we use a hammer [Music] Amanda we know you're crazy don't hurt him oh geez no I'm not helping you Amanda I will help Lily no what am I supposed to do help wooly you're not going to help me no I chose wooly oh okay well that was horrible it's time to watch another tape wait what's it say Riley's fun movies I think is what it says I don't feel good about this this is creepy okay well that didn't really do anything did it there's a tape on the trap door was he here before I am afraid to walk too close to it yeah I'm allergic to Apple yes whoa mushrooms how many this is creepy am I supposed to get information out of this so those are the four numbers we need to open this dresser that's gotta be it so how many chairs one okay I wrote it down chairs mushrooms fruit lights mushrooms there are now one two three four five six seven eight so one eight fruits one two three four five one eight five and then lights how many lights are there one two two all right okay I have to have this wrong so I said one for chair but maybe a sofa is a chair so it'd be two two eight five two what about the fruit I feel like I missed a fruit I said five the earlier there was a hidden fruit one two three four five yep there's a hidden fruit so it's six two eight six two yes oh that felt so satisfying so we have another tape some jackets and a bucket I'm gonna take the tape first home movies we're so close I can feel it you whoa whoa I just experienced so much just now I think this has got to be the last tape there's like 27 cryptic messages in there I think Amanda just told us to die and Woolly he's not doing well the code she said was four zero one two five eight it's what guys okay so I think this robot just said there's treasure in this chest and that it's not on the outside but the inside that matters which I could see in in this situation why he's he's saying that but I think the robot is keeping us from getting in the chest right now the only thing we haven't used is the bucket do you want the bucket oh no that's not how do I use this bucket oh scoop up some water in the bucket yeah did I get some water in the bucket there we go fill it up a little bit all right we obviously have to use this water bucket at some point right and if the robot the robot is preventing us from getting the treasure and he knows it always I will do anything please okay I'm sorry I just have to do it please do not forget me I won't you're a nice robot I just had to I'm sorry whoa the key guys does this mean I get the treasure don't step on the trap door I feel like something's gonna ooga boogers what and Oh I thought it was going to be like gold or something it's books in another tape that's not exactly the treasure I was expecting but all right we can share is what the tape I think said [Music] where's woolly [Music]

right now [Music] it's like the battle of the Titans right here bro that timing was like perfect bro [Music] oh dude whips is this pre-recorded is this entire spectating pre-recorded right here there's no way this timing is working like this [Music] fighting each other we've tried to replay it see if it lines up see if it lines up he's got the line the battle is occurring [Music] these guys are in the same way he died to himself [Music] did that guy just blow himself off with a what was someone else third party has answered [Music] amazing that this guy's still alive I'm gonna be honest with you I thought he would have died a million times ago [Music] we are music's almost over I think it's gonna line up oh we tried the train honked when the music ended you guys catch that all right and we are here ladies and gentlemen live looking at ps4lr tiller artillery just what are you playing with what is this [Music] guy's getting landed that might have been the worst player I've ever looked at I'm not even trolling I he might have been the worst this guy's a Cowboys fan are you like an actual Cowboy you know what I mean whoa these Cowboys fit yo let's go okay we can't gas up the Cowboys and then have you just get absolutely fried like that all right we're not allowed gosh dang it that gunfight kind of looks like the Cowboys season all right dude you guys are funny holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] Jason [\u00a0__\u00a0] born up here our our boy just got decimated bro oh he's using the intervention oh here we go he is him oh yeah this is the guy for sure this is the guy we want to be on are we spectating the best the best sniper in war zone history is anyone getting chills in the arena is it true that Tim is in this Lobby I don't know why I read that like I'm [\u00a0__\u00a0] Dobby bro all right we've stopped playing stuff well you know we got to make excited me to do something right goodness gracious that was pretty good I love the 74. what is this blueprint bro is this a new one this might be a new one I feel like I've never seen it a little stun oh it hit oh this thing's kind of what though hey bro yo this gun's kind of cracked it's called I right someone else climbing [Music] I mean that was just well played through that you threw that Betty down wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait you know Tim's like 9 50 in the morning yeah we out here bro going for this I'm [\u00a0__\u00a0] in bro we stun ourselves the whole strategy you'll see how it turns out a little stun and hit was there that was the MP7 how did he not get stunned by the way it was the MP7 there's the red laser wow brother are you taking the car I can't believe how fast people are dying in this game that is unreal oh we got a little ranks play swell here bro I thought these pistols are ass now no oh I know what's your primary rpk and the pistols uh have you not played in well Casey we got this little guy who's like a ranked player you know what I mean let's see how he does when he gets tossed into the war zone ranked skill does not translate into Warzone damn you're gonna take that Casey and get [\u00a0__\u00a0] on Casey goes he's not gonna take that how could he communicate to me what ranked he is okay one for bronze two for silver three for diamonds right four for Platt like do you know what I'm saying like what rank are you oh he just typed it he's Diamond three that's a little easier he ended last season Diamond one that correct me if I'm wrong that's actually better than most the players right Diamond one I'm pretty sure when you like statistically look at it like I'm pretty sure that diamond one is like top okay look he's you see you see how I know he's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] sweat you see him snake that window okay dude this is the hardest building to take back in this game and Casey is just in the godspot candy snakes if I'm if I'm if I'm looking at live Vegas odds right now I'm throwing a million dollars on Casey bro Casey wants me to coach him Casey it's very simple you don't leave this building you win is it boring yes effective to get this W yes Crimson is two percent okay so Crimson is two percent so that means Diamond one has got to be like top ten percent right gotta be I've coached people before all right it's seven percent okay two percent of players in the world if you really think about it that way he's a ranked player right so he's top seven percent in ranked let's see if he can secure a war zone win shall we I mean like I said hey this is boring bro but it's effective about having the rpk out although I'm pretty sure those pistols are ass so that literally might be oh my God Casey there's no way you're losing this bro there's no way no one can kill you up here as long as you're not a bot and your top seven percent it's pretty crazy to think that he's top seven percent in ranked play and he has two kills in Warzone never expandable Mega wolf yeah Casey just keep snaking bro we got this man we're gonna win this whoa whoa whoa where'd that come from make it on your left okay I don't want to distract you you did he's right there he saw his gun through the wall that was a good win Casey you're a literal [\u00a0__\u00a0] bullet though do you see his health bottom left someone else coming in that was the door I don't think I have to tell you that nuke skin here we go how did he get another plane on that fast who's hey you're taught your top seven percent in the world bro I remember that [\u00a0__\u00a0] foreign oh God this is kind of a gamble playing this wall is probably a good call but someone could technically hop above him is he gonna be able to bring this home for the ranked players or is Warzone gonna win find out next time on Dragon Ball Z I love this rotation with those shots I don't know about this Precision I would have saved it for the rotation that's just me personally 1v1v1 you know one's kind of near the tower I wish we saved the Precision Tower guy we have a gold gas mask how's it going to play it this is good this is good actually are we putting that on Casey it was a great rotation he just honest to God the reason he loses that is the reload glitch it's more of a game mechanic right Call of Duty reload though if I've ever seen one but I I probably wouldn't I you know you know what I I don't know if we put that on Casey man that was a good that was a good run that was a good run for Casey very well I mean top seven percent player in the world technically right if he's Diamond one top seven percent in ranked play but listen to a t-tv in Warzone so you know it is what it is"

comment them on my YouTube channel Instagram or Tick Tock because I will be using them in future videos in the continuation of this series so make sure you comment them and all the products that I'm going to talk about in today's video will be linked in the description box below if you do want to support me on my channel I make a small commission from those links but they're just there's a resource in case you do decide to do some shopping no pressure whatsoever as always so let's get into it so Teresa asks do you have any recommended skin products for dry skin my skin gets really dry so I started to apply Vicks on the dry spots which is on around my nose I put on moisturizer every day I use the Cetaphil one okay first up I definitely do not recommend to fix it contains really strong concentrations of fragrance and essential oil which will irritate your dry skin areas I would say opt for other petrolatum based products my personal favorites are the CeraVe healing ointments which has ceramides in it to replenish and hydrate this skin it's a similar feel and consistency to Vicks but without the risk of the irritation or sensitivity or if you want a really simple option that you can pretty much find anywhere Aquaphor healing ointment great one as well but as opposed to just using that on its own I recommend applying a moisturizer underneath because a petrolatum based product will only be a seal on the surface of your skin but it's not really going to moisturize your skin that's what a moisturizer is for and then the petrolatinum product will kind of serve as a force field protectant over the top to make sure you don't lose any additional water from your skin for affordable moisturizers for dry skin I recommend the bioma moisturizing Rich cream a really nice consistency that works well to really deeply nourish any dry areas you have or the elf happy hydration cream that one does have CBD in it to help calm any irritation or redness or if you do want to splurge on a really good moisturizer my personal favorite for dry skin is the skin fix triple lipid barrier peptide cream I just cannot sing enough phrases to that product it is the best of the best so or amazing for dry skin put Jesus first sorry that username makes me laugh but work put Jesus first what should we use to cleanse slash exfoliate I have dry slash very dry skin I also have sensitive skin and it has recently been reddish so I feel the struggle I struggle with dryness on my cheeks and also overall redness prone skin for exfoliating I really recommend ingredients like phas or mandelic acid both of which are humectants which will help to draw in moisture from the air into your skin which is great for dryness plus they're both really gentle but still effective to work ideally for dry skin and avoid scrubs like the plague oh my gosh I'm never a fan of Scrubs but if you have dry skin that is like one of the worst things you can do avoid them for phas I recommend the inky list PHA toner or if you want a combination of both phas and mandelic acid in one formula the selfless by Hiram mandelic acid serum has a bunch of good exfoliating ingredients to work for your skin but it really works amazingly for very sensitive or irritated skin it is still the only exfoliating product to this day that I can use on my very sensitive neck but it still gets the job done for exfoliation and then for a cleanser that reduces sensitivity I would look for anything that includes centella green tea or specifically matcha like the Crave Beauty matcha hemp hydrating cleanser so good for dry skin very gentle but has amazing ingredients to help reduce that redness and sensitivity you might be experiencing Ivy asked hi I'm a 13 year old girl and I've started skincare just over a year ago congratulations that's so awesome I'm so proud of you for starting so young your skin is going to look gorgeous throughout your life keep it up I have clear dry skin and the facial sunscreen I buy is so expensive for such a little portion do you have any good affordable sunscreens with at least 30 SPF thank you of course affordable sunscreens are my passion I would definitely recommend checking out my best sunscreens of 2022 video because I organize them all by skin type price point and each of the benefits but the main two that come to mind the beauty of joseon SPF 50 sunscreen wow is this formula incredible I've gotten so many people in my life addicted to this sunscreen because it's so good you can find it for 13 it lasts a long time and gives a little bit of a nice glow to it which is great for dry skin or the essential hyaluronic acid SPF 50 sunscreen as well this one has a cult following it's really really popular and I totally understand why and the hyaluronic acid in it will be great if your skin suffers from dehydration and you can find it under 20 but like I said definitely go check out my best sunscreens of 2022 because I have a lot more recommendations there Emma asked hi there I found your channel from Kendall's podcast oh my gosh thank you so much for watching if you guys don't listen to my podcast just position I highly recommend it I collaborate with a bunch of your favorite creators and one of them was the one and only Kendall Ray who was absolutely incredible so thank you so much for listening as someone who struggles to find a good sunscreen because my skin breaks out and hives with any SPF above 25 and has super dry skin do you have any recommendations I struggle to find any that are out or below SPF 25. so if you do find that you break out in hives or have a sensitive reaction to sunscreens I definitely recommend opting for mineral sunscreens particularly sunscreens that only have zinc oxide because compared to chemical sunscreens or even titanium dioxide zinc oxide has the lowest risk of making your skin freak out and I personally recommend the pipette SPF 50. it's a great affordable sunscreen and particularly good if you do have dry skin because it has a richer formula or the Sun by mineral SPF 30 sunscreen this has been one of my favorites for a while but I will say keep in mind if this concern continues and you notice yourself breaking out in hives with whatever sunscreen you use that's one I definitely recommend going to a dermatologist or a doctor to get that checked out because that could be signifying more severe skin allergens that you might have and that's something that only a dermatologist would be able to help out with so keep a close eye on your skin see how the recommendation works I'm sorry I wish there was more I could help with but sometimes you really just need a doctor to help you out with those kinds of things Tita asks can I use first aid coconut water cream for dry skin no no no no baby I mean here's the thing everyone's skin reacts differently to products but I will say first APD coconut water cream is one of my favorites for very very oily skin but if you have dry skin that's definitely not not going to be moisturizing enough and instead I would recommend the first aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream I have loved that moisturizer forever it's really good for dry skin dehydration definitely opt for that one because as much as I love the coconut water cream and it has been one of my top favorites for years it is definitely for the most oily of skin types not dry skin I'm sorry I hope you didn't buy the product already but could you please recommend something really simple and affordable with basic routine to follow for dry skin with acne all over the face yes of course that is one of the top questions I get asked about when it comes to dry skin what do I do if I have dry skin and I have acne it's a really tricky concern but here are the products I recommend first like I said before the Crave Beauty matcha hemp hydrating cleanser amazing for dry skin and reducing that sensitivity you might experience for a treatment I recommend the selfless mandelic acid serum because it has a blend of ingredients that are humectants to help with that dryness gently exfoliate the skin but not aggravate any sensitivity plus it has a little bit of salicylic acid to help with those acne and breakout concerns as well for a moisturizer the Aveeno eczema gel cream I recently discovered this one and it is so good I love it because the formula is really targeted at anyone who has severely dry skin but it's a gel cream so it's very lightweight and doesn't look super greasy super heavy on the skin and potentially contribute to the discomfort you may experience from acne and then finally for a sense screen I recommend the hero Cosmetics SPF 30 sunscreen this was listed as my top sunscreen of 2022 because it's just such a beautiful formula it has a slight green tint to offset any redness that you might experience from those breakouts it's a mineral formula it's affordable just a great product overall as always feel free to test out products see which ones work for your skin but those would be my main recommendations for anyone who is struggling with dry skin and breakouts nursage asks hi can anyone help me I have dry skin can I apply snail Essence snail mucin is such an underrated ingredient in my opinion and amazing if you have dry skin it sounds a little weird but the benefits for your skin are really incredible and it really helps with giving you very bouncy plump hydrated glowy skin oh it's amazing that's one of those ingredients where I sometimes wish my skin was a little bit more dry because of how beautiful it makes the skin look but with my oily areas it's just uh yeah that's not gonna happen if you have very dry skin I recommend the Kazar X snail mucin Essence that one is best for that really intense glowy appearance or if you want a little bit more of a lightweight serum the beauty of joseon ginseng and snail Essence is an awesome choice plus you get the benefits of ginseng with it either one those are my top two picks for snail music Essence it is such a great ingredient for dry skin Sora asked a good question if I have eczema do I have dry skin great question and I definitely recommend going and watching my video dedicated to answering your guys's questions about Eczema but here's the thing eczema is dry skin but dry skin is not eczema eczema is a skin condition that consists of a severely impaired moisture barrier flaky skin pain discomfort cracks in the skin and sometimes in extreme cases like what I've experienced bleeding eczema is brutal and if you want to learn more about that definitely go watch my video but if you don't experience those specific things then I would say you definitely have more dry skin while they seem similar they're definitely not the same thing anandita oh I love you guys names they're so cool asked what should someone with dry skin who lives in a dry climate be using IF hyaluronic acid isn't ideal super good question and a lot of people aren't aware of this hyaluronic acid is definitely praised as like the best skincare ingredient ever but in my opinion A lot of times it can be a little bit over hyped and if you are someone who lives in a dry environment who also has dry skin hyaluronic acid is definitely not ideal for you because the way that it works is that it attracts moisture from the air but if you're applying a hyaluronic acid serum on your face and there's really no moisture in the air like here in Joshua Tree for example the middle of the desert it will instead pull water from within your skin increasing that dehydration and dryness you are experiencing my alternative ingredient recommendations is first glycerin it is such an underrated ingredient and glycerin you can really find in so many different products thankfully but glycerin is great for addressing dryness without the possible concerns that hyaluronic acid has with it centellasiatica is another incredible ingredient for increasing the hydration within the skin you can find some teleasiatica and a bunch of Brands as well it's in selfless by Hiram products but you can also find it in a lot of Korean skincare products as well or another ingredient that a lot of people don't really know about polyglutamic acid amazing for deeply hydrating and nourishing the skin in a similar way to hyaluronic acid but in my opinion it is better than hyaluronic acid but yeah this would be my alternative ingredients and then finally Taylor asks I'm really starting to think that there is something wrong with my skin I live in Florida my home is usually around 50 to 60 percent humidity and I use a steamer and then later on at least three moisturizing products after and I still have dry skin what should I do so I could sit here and give you product recommendations I could give you skin care hacks but I think given the amount of effort that you are putting in to ensure your skin has as much moisture and hydration in your environment as possible and you're still experiencing skin dryness I would definitely recommend going to a dermatologist with these concerns because that definitely signifies that something is just not adding up in your skin it's not quite making sense because for most other people you would definitely see an increase of moisture on your skin but if you're still not I think a Derma dermatologist can really be helpful in helping you with those concerns the only thing I would add on is to try slugging slugging is one of the best solutions for helping to ensure that your skin doesn't lose water throughout the day or night and you just use the petrolatum based product like CeraVe healing ointment or Aquaphor all over your face at night that will help to seal water into your skin which sometimes moisturizes on their own just aren't able to do but if that still doesn't work definitely go to a dermatologist because your skin should be seeing an increase in moisture and hydration and if you are concerned about the price point of a dermatologist I would say check out services like dramatica or curology they're able to give you some Dermatology advice for a much lower price point than say going to a traditional dermatologist but yeah that would be my best recommendation I know it's not ideal and it can be pricey but let me tell you it will save you a lot of expenses of having to buy so many different products for dry skin down the road okay and those are all the questions I am going to finish with this video because it is almost dark outside and once it is dark uh yeah the filming stops but thank you guys so much for asking these questions there were a whole lot more but they were basically all asking the same type of things as what I covered in this video but if you do have any additional questions or concerns please comment them down below I would love to respond or include them in future videos be sure to check out my other videos in this series as well and if you don't see your specific skin concern included please comment yours because I would love to make a dedicated video to it in the future like I said before all the products that I've talked about in today's video are listed in the description box below if you do want to do some shopping and if you guys haven't already be sure to subscribe to my channel and hit the notification Bell so you can see

   "Ne-Yo": {
      "name": "Ne-Yo",
      "corpus": "- I learned very early on that one of the more passionate genres of music was R&B. R&B is basically melodic passion. (upbeat music) I realized that it was gonna be music for me at nine years old. I grew up in a house with my mother, my sister, my grandmother, five aunts, and me. But my mom, you know, blue collar mom, just making sure that the kids was all right, she worked every casino, pretty much every position in the casino that you could work. Every night, she would bring home a different kind of music for me and her to sit around and listen to, you know? Initially, it was a lot of R&B, a lot of Motown and stuff like that, but then she started bringing home, like, Wayne Newton and the Rat Pack, Tom Jones and stuff like that. And that kind of fueled my love for melody as opposed to just music. I'm living in this house with all of these women, and I'm writing in a journal because initially, I was kind of an angry little kid. Dad wasn't around, uncles come and go real quick. As I'm growing up, becoming a young man, I don't really have anybody to bounce these emotions off of. I needed an outlet, and initially, I started doing really, really stupid stuff, breaking windows, just something to get it off me, whatever it was. My mom gave me the notebook, the red notebook, and she said, \"Write it down.\" And I said, \"Write what down?\" And she said, \"I don't care, just write it down. Whatever it is you're feeling, whatever it is going on in there, write it down there.\" The breaking point, I don't remember what I was upset about, but I was really, really mad at something, and I ran in my room and I slammed the door and I grabbed my notebook. Initially, I was writing words, but then after a while, it just kind of became (snarls). Just trying to get that off of me, you know? And what I realized after I was done is that I didn't feel those emotions anymore. Whatever it is that was bothering me, it wasn't bothering me anymore because it wasn't inside anymore, it was on a page now. From journal entries to poetry to songs, that was kind of the transition for me. In an R&B song, it was okay for a man to cry. In an R&B song, it was okay for a man to show weakness. Like, it was all right to be vulnerable in R&B if you did it right and if you did it from the heart. My five kings are Prince, Stevie, Marvin, Michael, Sammy David Jr. These five men are the five that, you know, if you can meld them into one person, that's what I've been trying to accomplish my whole career. It was actually a friend of mine in school that told me that music is something that you could actually do as a career. Like, you could grow up and be a guy that just does music and people give you money for it. And I was like, \"Word? Oh, okay, well I found my career. That's what I'm doing. Yeah, sign me up now. I'm in, I'm in.\" And I never looked back. Mario's \"Let Me Love You\" was my first number one. It's the first number one song that I had ever written. Which was weird for me because I had, like, the number one song on the radio, but nobody knew who the hell I was. Like, I could walk up down the street and not be bothered by anybody, which honestly, was kind of cool. You see cars rolling by and they blaring it loud, and I'm like, \"I wrote that, yeah, that's me.\" \u266a Baby, I just don't get it \u266a \u266a Do you enjoy being hurt \u266a \u266a I know you smell the perfume \u266a \u266a The makeup on his shirt \u266a \u266a You don't believe his stories \u266a \u266a You know that they're all lies \u266a \u266a Bad as you are, you stick around \u266a \u266a And I just don't know why \u266a - I dug that part of being a songwriter, the freedom to still be a regular person, while at the same time, music is still your profession. After that song came out and did what it did, for a long time, I didn't have a name. I was, \"Oh, yeah, you the kid that wrote the Mario song.\" That was my name. That's what everybody... \"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the kid that wrote the Mario song. Hey, hey, go call the kid that wrote the Mario song.\" And I answered to it proudly, like, \"Yep, yep, that's me, I did that, that was me.\" That song got me the attention of a lot of different people, L.A. Reid and Jay-Z, for example, which would eventually become the record deal that would introduce Ne-Yo to the world. (gentle music) When we first started putting together my first album, at this point, I have the Mario record and everybody knows that I can write a hit for other people. So now the question became, can he do it for himself? So there was a little bit of pressure, but I say a little bit because I wasn't really letting it bother me. I was just so happy to be in the position that I was in. It's like, yo, I am really sitting in a room right now, surrounded by people that are dedicated to helping me produce my first album. This is a dream come true. This is what I've wanted since I was nine years old. Like, I'm here, and I was very much aware of what it was in the moment. We wasn't concerning ourselves with genre, we wasn't concerning ourselves with where we was gonna land, we was just jumping, just because we was just enjoying what we was doing. I genuinely feel like when you listen to that album, you can kind of hear the joy that everybody was feeling as we was putting these records together. Like, it just felt, everything just felt right. I don't know if you've ever been in that place in life where, and it doesn't have to be major, but where for whatever reason, everything just kind of fell in line on that day. Like, I had a, like, full four months of that. When I first met Stargate, if you know, you know. Two tall, lanky white dudes from Norway. And I must admit, I definitely walked in the room and judged a book by its cover. I was like, there's no R&B happening here. The very first track they ever played me was the music that we now know as \"So Sick\". (\"So Sick\") I let them get about 15 seconds through and I was like, \"Wait, wait, wait, wait, run that back.\" Played it again. \u266a Ding, ding, ding, ding \u266a Somebody got a pen? \u266a Ooh \u266a \u266a Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo \u266a \u266a Gotta change my answering machine \u266a \u266a Now that I'm alone \u266a \u266a 'Cause right now, it says that we \u266a \u266a Can't come to the phone \u266a \u266a And I know it makes no sense \u266a \u266a 'Cause you walked out the door \u266a \u266a But it's the only way I hear \u266a \"So Sick\" is about the first time that I ever truly, truly fell in love. At that point in my life, when the story took place, I maybe might have been 15, maybe 16, somewhere in there. I had said I love you before. Well, I'm not proud of it, we all grow from somewhere, but at one point, if that meant me getting what I want, I would say it. Just kind of was what it was. I know I'm not alone. Anyway. (laughs) \u266a Cryin' over you \u266a \u266a And I'm so sick of love songs \u266a \u266a So tired of tears \u266a \u266a So done with wishing \u266a With this particular girl in this particular time, it was real, I actually meant it, I really did love her. But the problem was, when it's a group of friends, one guy in the group gets a girlfriend, so now he's spending all the time with the girlfriend and not hanging out with the crew anymore. Yeah, I was that guy. My friends would call like, \"Hey, your girl gonna let you out the house tonight?\" You know, like stupid stuff like that. And me being just young and young minded, I let it get to me, I let that start bothering me to the point where I started treating her poorly. \u266a And your memory \u266a \u266a And how every song reminds me of what used to be \u266a She wasn't with that, she left, and I didn't realize the stupid thing that I had done until she was gone, which is kind of the way of all things. Like, you don't realize what you had until it's gone. I kid you not, at the time, no matter where I was at, no matter what station we put on on the radio, there was always a sad-ass slow song playing that would just take me back to the fact that you just lost somebody that you genuinely and truly cared about behind pride and ego. That song poured outta me in probably about three minutes. It might be the fastest song I've ever written. (\"Sexy Love\") \"Sexy Love\", kind of to a degree written about the same girl. She kind of had a hold on me. She did. I will admit, she kind of had a hold on me. I just remember that whenever she would breathe right here, that I would get, like, these chills, these goosebumps, and like, it would make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I listen to the track that they're playing and I just keep getting thrown back into these memories of that relationship, and you know, the good stuff when it was good, and the line just came to me. \u266a She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up \u266a \u266a Just one touch \u266a The day the album came out (laughs), I remember waking up and throwing up, like, right away, like (groans). When the first numbers came in and they told me I did, like, 370 first week, 370,000 copies first week, (sighs) okay, okay, they like it. We good. From my first album debuting at number one, moving on up the line in time to winning my first Grammy, meeting the president, performing at the White House multiple times, it took a good 10 years for me to, like, sit still long enough to realize what we had actually done. Once the ball started rolling, we didn't stop. We was on a roll for like two years straight at one point. Like, we just didn't stop. We didn't even really have the time to sit and celebrate and kind of bask in it in the moment because things just kept moving, and we liked it that way. \u266a I sit up all night thinkin' bout ya \u266a \u266a And I know it ain't right, baby, but I don't \u266a \u266a I don't think that I, don't think I can let go \u266a \u266a Don't think I can let you go \u266a There is power in music. There is world-changing, life-changing, lifesaving power in music, and when you realize that, you kind of can't look at it the way you did anymore, you can't unknow it. You have to kind of lock into that responsibility now. I've done everything in my power to maintain my normalcy because I've seen what happens when you allow yourself to buy all the way in to the smoke and mirrors and the glitz and glamour and the fantasy that is the music industry. And I told myself this at a very, very young age, very early in my career, no matter how big I get, I will always be a regular damn person. I have to lock into the truth, which is I'm no better than anybody else. If you can keep that right here as all of the fantasy and glitz and glamour is happening around you, you might be all right. If you ever lose sight of that, we've seen what can happen. Can't have that happen to me, especially now I got kids. I got people that's depending on me. I've circled the globe three, four times at this point. I've been a little bit everywhere, done a little bit of everything, and I can honestly say the most fulfilling thing that I've ever done is be a father. It is the greatest thing I've ever done. Being a parent will teach you patience. It'll teach you humility. It'll teach you the importance of time. If you haven't latched onto that yet, how valuable time is, spend 10 minutes with your kid just doing something silly. As long as he's laughing and having a good time, you've done your part as a parent. Like, don't beat yourself up because you don't get to spend all day with your kids. Who spends all day with their kids? Well, maybe now, 'cause this whole pandemic thing. I don't care about fame, none of that stuff means anything to me anymore. I want you to go get it because I need to feed my kids. That's why I want you to go get it now. That's the most important thing now. That is the focal point of life. (gentle music) (child babbling) - Cut, cut, baby girl. (gentle music) What it is to be a Black man in America is to be in a foot race with a bunch of other people, and for whatever reason, you have on a backpack full of bricks, shackles on both feet, handcuffs, and a person with a gun on your heels, and you gotta run this race same as everybody else with all of these things attached to you, with all of these things making it that much harder for you to get anywhere. You have to be that much better, that much smarter, that much faster, whatever the case may be. In order to get ahead in this life, you have to be excellent pretty much at all times. Your excellence has to hide the fact that you're Black to some of these people. Okay, he's Black, but he's really smart. Okay, yeah, he's Black, but damn, he can shoot that basketball. Yeah, he's Black, but ooh, did you hear that song? Black men are definitely a target. It's an accomplishment for a Black man to get old enough for somebody to call him old. Somebody called me old the other day and I said, \"Thank you.\" Damn right, 41. If 41 is old, then I'll be old all day long, because I know cats younger than me that ain't here no more. We say Black Lives Matter. We didn't say white lives don't matter. We didn't say Black Lives Matter more. We just said Black Lives Matter. That just means we matter too. George Floyd was not the first Black man to be killed by police on camera. What made this so special is that the world slowed down and everybody had no choice but to look and see what is happening here. You couldn't unsee that. You couldn't ignore that. \u266a How do I sing \u266a - I got the privilege to sing for the family at George Floyd's funeral. They asked me to sing. They didn't tell me what to sing. They said, \"Just choose something that you feel like is appropriate for the moment.\" So I got up there and I sang \"It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday.\" \u266a I thought we'd get to see forever \u266a \u266a But forever's gone away \u266a - As I was walking off stage, his brother stopped me and said, \"Bro, I don't know if you knew, that was one of George's favorite records. That was one of his favorite songs, period.\" \u266a And I'll take with me the memories \u266a \u266a To be my sunshine after the rain \u266a \u266a It's so hard to say goodbye \u266a \u266a To yesterday \u266a - The only way for you to fail is to just not do anything. (upbeat music) All the tools are right there in your face. You just gotta dedicate the time to it and be patient enough to let it happen the way it's gonna happen. I have been working on a brand new album that will be out this year. Concept of this album is basically just an escape from the screwy and crummy reality that is right now. I feel like we didn't need another record reminding us that things are fucked up right now. I don't need to remind you of that in a colorful song. I don't need to do that for you. You can turn on the TV and see that. You can look out your window and see that. What you do need is a moment to inhale and exhale. This album is an hour and 40 minutes roughly of breathe, get away from the stresses and dramas of your life for just this long, let it re-energize you so that you can walk back out into that storm and do what it is you gotta do. That's what this album is. Music is a part of who I am, literally, physically, it's part of who I am, so I will always do music that will always be, and any other mediums that I can lend myself to and do right by, you'll see me there too. So I'm gonna say what I always say, keep your eyes to the sky, ears to the ground, you will hear me, see me, I will be around always. \u266a Pure seduction in her eyes \u266a \u266a I've heard story after story, no surprise \u266a"

      "corpus": "got a warm welcome to this talk it's Sunday the 30th of April now today's studies really quite impressively uh interesting it's about cannabis now most of you will probably know in cannabis there's two main ingredients there's the THC the tetrahydrocannabine oh that's the bit that gets you high if you use this substance and there's the other one the CBD the cannabidiol which is very much none uh psychotropic it doesn't affect the brain at all now I'm going to give evidence today that the CBD the cannabidiol seems to have and there's pretty good evidence from this study and other studies antiviral properties now we'll be looking at evidence that it uh reduces the infection from SARS coronavirus too and helps with the illness and we'll be looking at evidence that it helps with another RNA virus hepatitis C now let me tell you what evidence I'm going to be considering and you can decide if you want to watch this video this is oral by the way it's not injections and in all cases it's been completely non-toxic at the doses that have been described now the first line of evidence that this works against SARS coronavirus 2 and probably other viruses but the researchers on SARS coronavirus too is in human lung cell cultures where it prevented infection when the cells were infected if they'd been exposed to the to the cannabidiol two hours before it essentially prevented all of the infection but it didn't work with THC so this means that if people are smoking cannabis or using cannabis products that are mixed with CBD and THC the ones that will get you high it won't work this is strictly the non-psychotropic version tetrahydrocan are being all inhibited the effect of the cannabidiol in terms of antiviral properties so that's the first one human cell cultures the second evidence is from mice so it actually works in animals infected mice they were given CBD cannabidiol twice a day for four days and they had 40 times less viral particles in their lungs really quite impressive and the third line of evidence is human now in the United States they managed to recruit 1221 people that are on cannabidiol to prevent epilepsy and they found that they were 50 less likely to get infected with SARS coronavirus II and they had no follow-up on whether they got sicker or not but it would be likely that these people didn't get uh sick as their counterparts may have done it especially with the early versions of SARS coronavirus too so three impressive lines of evidence we're going to look at probably works against appetite to see some evidence for that terrible disease hepatitis C could well work against colds flu Ebola mumps and measles the reason I'm saying that is purely because they're other RNA viruses we don't know but it could potentially work against that so I would certainly call for uh um immediate research to be done on this but of course hemp plants which is where this essentially comes from can be grown up by the hectare and uh hemp oil the cannabidiol can be produced for essentially nothing and it can be produced by anyone it's not a it's not a specific preparation so again because any producer who meets basic food manufacturing requirements could set up and produce this it's unlikely that big Pharma are going to do the clinical trials so this could be another one of those uh potentially brilliant treatments that's going to be completely lost to humanity because there's no money in it and I'm going to stop there otherwise I'll get crossed let's let's go back and look at the evidence now that's what this video is about so this is the original paper here cannabidiol inhibits SARS coronavirus II replication and promotes host innate immune response now this was a preprint so I did come across this I think last year but I decided not to take it up but now it's uh it's fully peer-reviewed so we now have the evidence in hand and well um it's taken me a while to read through this paper it really is quite an impressive piece of work very biochemical I had to look up a few other words I must confess um but so this is my understanding of the paper but I think I think I've got the the main points uh fairly accurately uh cannabidiol potential regulator of the host stress so this is the the way that the body responds or the cells respond to viral infection and it also looks like it is it um it uh it helps antiviral inflammatory responses now there was two things here first of all it helped the beneficial inflammatory response which is what you need as part of the immune response but also it inhibited the release of the cytokines which causes the cytokine storm so it looks like we're getting the benefits of the immunity but inhibiting the cytokine storm so it really is a win-win uh preparation according to the evidence cited in this study um kind of bedial class of natural products so it's a natural product natural products of course are great there's all sorts of natural products let's think of some for example opium is a natural product from opium poppies antibiotics are a natural product from molds the very the the a lot of the best Therapeutics come from natural products um others we could mention um it's a normal solution so that's good now hemp hemp plants contain less than 0.3 percent uh THC tetrahydrocannabino so um but we'll show that this preparation was actually uh fairly pure um CBD oral solution is already FDA approved so given that this is FDA approved and it exists um there's no reason why in theory doctors shouldn't be allowed to prescribe it it would be off license for this product because it's only licensed for epilepsy at the moment or various types of fitting and as I say the large-scale clinical trials probably won't be done but they should be done High purity CBD inhibits SARS coronavirus 2 replication in human lung epithelial cells so this is human cell lines that they're taking cells that were taken from humans have been bred up in cultures and they're able to do experiments on these in my view this is quite ethical research it's actually human cells taken from people who had lung cancer is where they got it from so the pre-treated human cells with CBD and these are with the ace receptor for two hours so the pre-treated with CBD for two hours CBD potentially inhibited viral replication under non-toxic conditions so the doses here that they used if you scaled this dose up to the uh the whole person that they were none toxic doses and CBD is a safe preparation anyway well safest you can never say it's completely safe but it's it's basically safe you can certainly buy it in supermarkets in the UK for example worked in other human cell lines so they tried another human cell lines they also tried it in Monkey kidney cells it also worked they tested it on the Wuhan strain and three other variants of concern and it also worked the ability to infect cells was comparable uh was comparably inhibited by cannabidiol so in all of these uh the Wuhan strain the three variants of concern all of them couldn't effectively or as effectively infect the cells treated with cannabidiol so it looks like it's working for all of the SARS coronavirus 2 viruses and as we say very likely to work for other viruses now um they tried quite a few they tried few a few preparations of cannabidiol to make sure it wasn't just the um um the particular preparation so here they add different suppliers um here they have the positivity of the spike protein and we see here that as the doses go up the numbers go down until up up in these doses here we essentially have no viral expression and as we say these are non-toxic doses that you could have used and they actually tested these with various methods to make sure that it was fairly pure cannabidial and they found out it was 97 to 100 percent uh pure cannabidiol because when you extract products from natural plants like the hemp plant you're going to get other alkaloids in there or as well other other cannabis products as well but they were sure it was the the CBD and one of its as we'll see one of its metabolites that was having the benefit so was it the other cannibaloids well no they checked so basically it wasn't the other cannibaloids 97 to 100 pure using quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance uh scanning don't pretend to give and know much about that at all but it is an industry standard way of measuring compounds in in plants and things like that so it is an accurate way to do it that is uh that is clear no toxicity was observed for any of the CBD preparations that the dose is used to inhibit viral replication no toxicity this was safe at the dose is used it could be scaled up to the whole human body and the CBD metabolite so it was CBD and its metabolite seven hydroxycannabidiol now what happens here is the um this is quite common for example if you take codeine for example the codeine itself isn't a very a very good painkiller but it goes to the liver and the liver converts it into morphine so the reason that um the the reason that codeine is an effective analgesic is it is the metabolite is morphine and in the same way here the CBD worked and one of its metabolites there's seven hydroxycanabadaric her cannibidiol also was anti-viral so two ways to win there the CBD probably working originally when you take it then some of that's broken down into this uh seven hydroxy cannabidiol and that goes on working for a period of time so uh and interestingly these are exactly the same molecules that are known to be effective in suppressing uh some forms of um seizures that people take cannabis for already or this particular CBD preparation for so both of these the CBD and its metabolites exhibited antiviral activity the other cannabis compounds did not work and combining CBD with tetrahydrocannabenol significantly suppressed CBD activity so taking taking the sort of cannabis that gets people high would not work that's important to stress taking the Cannabis that gets people who I would not work because it's it basically there's a competition between the THC and the CBD and that stops the CBD working and the CBD and its metabolites are the active and uh equipotent ingredient for the treatment of epilepsy so that's why it works so the same things that work in epilepsy are the same things that are hiring this newly discovered antiviral that's very impressive antiviral property so it's working by uh early steps after viral entry into cells it's reducing that CBD targets host cell processes uh CBD exhibits uh viral RNA expression and reverse virus induced changes in in the host genome so in other words the virus actually what the virus does is it changes quite a few things in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the cell to make it more hospitable for itself the CBD undoes those changes quite amazing really I mean I don't pretend to understand how it does this but uh they did identify quite a few mechanisms that uh that can work for that CBD effectively eradicated viral RNA expression in the host cells I mean wow they weren't getting the viral expression the virus just couldn't reproduce inside those cells um prevents changes in the cell produced by the virus to force the cell to produce new viral particles so the the virus has got all these mechanisms to take over the uh the CBD blocks those C produces in strong activation of genes associated with host stress response now the stress response is the way that the cell responds to the infection and the CBD initiates the activation of genes which help that response so if you like the CBD it's partly working by genetically upgrading the cell by stimulating the genes to to make more antiviral activity in the cell quite amazing but this is what the biochemistry shows direct quote from the paper together these results suggest that CBD acts to prevent viral protein translation and Associated cellular changes amazing induction of viral genes for Spike envelope and nucleocapsulin protein is reduced by 99 percent just incredible just incredible um so if this had been if this is demonstrated to be effective as it looks if if everyone in the uh Wuhan area or around the people that were first infected won't go into the story of that now but if they've been on CBD that could have been a firewall around about this virus and pandemic might have never occurred non-toxic simple cheap readily available by the Tongue nothing complicated no huge profits for anyone and uh of course if it had been eradicated at source we would have never have needed the vaccinations either because there would have been no pandemic uh cbgd uh induction of increased transcription of three defense genes as we've said and these affect the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell which I won't go into but it's part of the cell that's associated with the ribosomes which makes the the new viruses it stops those from working also CBG induces interferons we've talked about interferons before interferons are antiviral uh cytokines really antiviral uh um signal molecules that when when a cell is infected by a virus it can release interferon and that goes to the cells around about and tells them to prepare for the infection so it kind of puts a firewall around about the infection so stimulating interferons also very uh important part of protection against viral infection promotes degradation of viral RNA so it messes up the viral RNA SARS coronavirus 2 infection suppressing the interferon signaling Pathways so it so the SARS coronavirus 2 would interfere with the interferon activity this undoes the Damage Done by the SARS coronavirus 2 and allows the interferon to carry on and indeed stimulates the interferon CBD effectively lowers the viral Titus so the viruses aren't there to add their suppression to the interferon as well CBD effectively reverses viral induced cytokines that can lead to the deadly cytokine storm so if this was given to so this work is about early infection but it sounds like it's also um could have saved many many lives by preventing the cytokine storm which of course would kill people of course the acute respiratory distress syndrome really quite amazing look at this paper it really is quite quite a oppressive array of effects that you wouldn't have expected CBD treatment significantly inhibits SARS coronavirus 2 replication in mice so the mice were deliberately infected with a virus a viral challenge they were given CBD twice a day for four days and CBD treatment significantly inhibited viral replication in the lungs and in the noses at five days CBD lowered lower Dosa so the lower dose of CBD if they gave a lower dose of CBD it reduced the viral dose in the lungs by a 4.8 fold higher dose of 40 times Less Price than the lungs and you know for most people that will be the difference between getting sick and not getting sick this is really quite quite staggering and even the higher dose was a non-toxic dose it was not making the mice sick the mice did not stop eating they did not lose weight the mice did not get sick but they had 40 times less virus in their lungs looking like a very safe way of doing this during this period the mice showed no signs of clinical disease and didn't get sick from the drug the authors say these results established the pre-clinical efficacy of CBD as an antiviral drug for SARS coronavirus 2 in the early stages of infection but potentially in the later stages because of the um reduced cytokines now what about humans CBD is negatively associated with uh with the indications of SARS grown advice to infection in patients medical records now here what they did was they looked up these more than 1200 patients so they're on CBD already and found that they got less infection they didn't follow them up when they got sick unfortunately but it would be interesting because it would be likely that they got that they didn't get sick as much because they weren't getting infected as much and the viral lobe will be lower of course all these things should be done with full-scale clinical trials but as we said that's probably not going to happen um unfortunately given that high Purity CBD preparations are taken by large numbers of individuals we examine where the CBD prescriptions are associated with uh interactions of SARS coronavirus to infection now apparently people are taking all solutions of CBD at 100 micrograms a ml um often using the treatment of seizures they analyzed 1200 patients taking already they then made up a control group match for age sex all the variables uh they found that 75 patients um with CB uh six six point two percent of the patient 75 patients with CBD got infected at 8.9 for non-cbd patients now this doesn't sound like a big difference 6.2 um got infected with CBD 8.9 got infected without CBD but of course this is absolute risk for the whole population so this is a huge difference and it worked out it worked out so the odds ratio in other words um it was a 45 protection for people that were probably taking it but for people that were sure taking it it was a 52 the odds ratio of uh four 4.48 52 protection and again these results are very significant only six chances in a thousand that arose by chance so these people were not getting infected this was having about a 50 people taking the adequate dose or having a 50 protection um against against infection um it's it really is quite quite significant pity they didn't have follow-up data on if they got sick or not but um as we say that that work wasn't outside the scope of this study potential for the cannabidiol for treatment of viral hepatitis that's the study there it looking good here it was CBD inhibited hepatitis C viral replication by 86 percent didn't work hepatitis B now this is interesting hepatitis C is an RNA virus Hepatitis B is a DNA virus so it looks like the data we have that this is working for RNA viruses probably not for DNA viruses but if we could get rid of the RNA viruses effectively and I've had an effective treatment for RNA viruses that would help to put it mildly let's just look at some of these infections common colds whether it's rhinoviruses or um coronaviruses are RNA viruses influenza is an RNA virus SARS 1 and Middle East for spider syndrome Dengue terrible disease hepatitis c and e all RNA viruses Ebola rabies polio mumps measles all RNA viruses if this turns out to be an effective treatment for RNA viruses this would be a major massive step forward in medical practice so I think what we need to do is take these clinical trials out of the hands of big Pharma because as we say I don't think they're going to do it because you can't make money out of CBD but this is a drug which could be precious for Humanity therefore governments and other agencies need to take on This research and we need to know definitively if this works and if it does it could be a Wonder treatment for many conditions let's hope this is done the work we have so far is impressive I'm really quite impressed with this article as you can probably tell um we'll leave it there because that's as far as the data goes thank you for watching"

what that is me neither I never did this in school or anything but we looked it up in like some people somewhere have done it we're split into team of three team of three and Me by myself because they thought it would be more fair that way ad teams have been given a bunch of 300 dropped off at Home Depot and given two hours to collect our supplies after that we head back to the house I'd have two hours to build our designs each bulb must have at least one member of the team in it and as soon as it touches the water the timer starts you have to pile your bow from one end of the pool to the other and back and the fastest team wins baby host Lily and Jody oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] hey buddy you smart looks like you're going in the boat Lily you know what he is no no no you are building it I'm building stuff too between you and me I have more experience who weighs less oh yeah actually out of all of us hmm hey thank you so uh who's going in the boat nose goes he didn't you you lost your own nose pose in a good old boat here I've never built the boat I didn't do this in high school my original thought was just to put a big clear storage containers in the water and that would be my boat but I don't think it's like stable or buoyant enough one maybe two maybe three Home Depot buckets together on either side I imagine it would be a combination of zip ties and like rope and then like a one paddle and we get a flag what are we thinking Confederate no no please no not that boat not if I'm captaining it like this makes it kind of hard to like push your paddle out of so I was hoping maybe like I'd get like a weed whacker together maybe tear apart like a fan and he's like the blades was a propeller yeah all right let's make our s'mores or whatever man I feel good about this I feel

perfect it's cheap dude I hope no one sees this behind the door if plenty of people buy doors no no I mean the other teams this is I want this to be my propulsion system a hundred dollars for an electric one wow electric is cheaper than gas this looks sweet I like the color the color design of the boat okay yeah yeah your seat I need my cockpit yeah yeah ah looks so good see that would float on its own oh wow dude should I get like a lawn chair to put in this I played a game called raft right whenever you put a wood down there was like four buckets under it they used the you pick up plastic and you pick up wood out of the ocean and you make this oh no you know it sounds good to me let's get the [\u00a0__\u00a0] buckets how many buckets we'll get a cart so we can load up some buckets with lids this is absorbent or is it is the same as pool floaties it feels like this it should be okay if water gets in the middle I think we buy those cut them in half and then just zip tie them to the bar yeah that's just easier actually let's just do that I think you're putting them this way but that's way easier but we still need like the water jugs we still need the buoyance things [Music] take the fan open it up take the fan blades fan blades are now my propeller okay let's get like the small stuff stamp she's in her own world all right we lived up and then we're gonna drop it towards your front Okay we only need one right yeah I don't think we're gonna dump do you want to double up no no no I say we do the fight we are video Gamers let's do the raft ID let's put the buckets under the plywood oh call it good okay well it's a bubble wrap at the same time it'll be easy to measure too because it'll be like bucket bucket okay okay I think we're actually the Geniuses Oz I think there's no way it'll sink in fact I'm so confident I'm willing to go on our boat after maybe maybe mulch ing moisture levels and starting your garden mold need to feed your family of four mulch okay seven dollars for a thing a two-stroke gas that's pretty good I think my boat might float but I I think the weed whacker is going to explode I didn't when I made the gas powered fishing pole out of my dad's weed whacker um that exploded a little bit but above ground you know like above water I think if it's in water it's totally fine I want it clear so that I can see the the Fauna of the ocean floor and I think I got a weed whack on my shoulder and it goes here are your two options of paddles I think this one would be good for length this one is a great shape though problem is that it's short though so like I don't know how far I think with the size of our door you stand on it you probably have to like lay on it so something short would actually be good how do we make these things stick do we have zip top epoxy pill epoxy glue oh it's like a paddle board almost oh these are very light like I do think it'll slow maybe we replaced the door with these I think we should get some of these okay okay 265 dollars they're 30 bucks ah here comes the last team oh wait I don't oh I see some stuff I hope it starts pouring whenever uh oh I hope so too we're back from Home Depot and we're gonna build our boats for two hours guys I I don't think it's gonna work tonight yes I agree with that yeah it's sunny it's funny it's not raining yes I didn't have to bring an umbrella let's go all right the faster we finish this the faster we can stop doing stuff you want to take a [\u00a0__\u00a0] don't you yeah can you are we stop I need to take a [\u00a0__\u00a0] as well probably a really big one because it's been backed up for like three days or something all right we have a door yeah what I'm thinking with these purple stuff around the border of the door so it's like a little box or yeah like a more reasonable thing would be to like put it under make small adjustments in additions until it floats so we start with the door throw the door into the pool you get on it if it floats we don't have to modify I have a microphone in my pocket we all have microphones in Alpha why do I have to get on it I forgot what I was gonna do that's a weed work what is it what is he doing guys oh I stole this I I didn't check these out I forgot let's check out the floatability of this here bucket oh yeah that floats oh that's so much weight holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh I'm not okay I'm not going anywhere but across that pond our first draft was inspired by raft let's say you stand on um bucket bucket Berry like I feel like you're gonna be playing like this balance game yeah yeah I will get in a very low stance so what I'm thinking is we can like legit measure by like just glue the lids glue and then this and just just glue all the lids on and yeah like it looks right I like that yeah oh yeah we can like what is this man doing I think that's his engine over here with a blank of wood and some buckets well no no no in our paddle yeah oh it needs to spin really fast to start but then it can run on idle something you just start it like this and then add this right so then you don't have to get hit with that like initial burst of speed I should probably do the actual thing first so that's what I'm saying I want to set up our pontoons super critical that these are hounded down and like you know sealed this is stupid I'll just assume that it's on hey I'm gonna hey can you sit on this for a sec wow can you just sit like you would rope all right so I think we just cut off what do you think I'll do it yeah offline TV is going to cover like any injuries and deaths and stuff like that right Michael how do you use this oh please don't use that huh please don't use that just use specifically how do I cut the wood oh I hope okay um okay no no apply a lot I think I think you just gotta sit on it just get on it just push me I'm not gonna push you yeah dude so we're not gonna cut the door I think we cut the door I think we cut the door we put three boxes oh I cannot I go I'm scared come on Jody come on come on up here you feel like a child that looks like cosplaying my dad keep it flat and just keep this flat part on this flat part Jesus [\u00a0__\u00a0]

that's okay you're good oh wow okay [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh she's not actually Oh it's leaking oh we got it you know really funny question does wood glue work on like plastic to wood or does it got to be like wood wood not for continuous submersion or use below the water line not for structural or load bearing applications that's funny that's that's two for two guys I say we just do this put some Flex Seal on it and call it good yep we have this that's what I'm talking about that's why that's why she's a captain don't worry Captain you're in good hands yeah yeah we haven't even started songs yet

      "corpus": "hello hello Governor Schwarzenegger welcome to longer tables and I think this is the fun thing about it here is that you have started this whole thing about longer tables uh this podcast and we have the average temperature which is a YouTuber series uh that deals with the environmental issues and others use deals with you know food and environmental issues also climate action and stuff like that and it was interesting because you people reached out to me uh to go and to be on your podcast and it was almost simultaneously when our people when they asked my people to reach out to you to have you on my show on stamp dish so here we are both of us together yeah this is the stamp dish exactly you don't have to have been a shot you can take it out of the shot here's mine but I want to say one thing I cannot believe you send you you send this to me all the way to Spain exactly and you send me you send me bonbons yes amazing from Vienna you send me these napolitans I guess very typically yes yes okay can you pronounce again Mr Wafers you know it's like it's like a Austin kind of a thing but I I I want you you and your whole team enjoying this and the good girls up here which is a good Austrian beer but I also want to say thank you very much for sending me uh your wine Spanish wine in the morning I'm gonna have for the first time before coffee and before breakfast I'm gonna have a little bit of wine cheers cheers cheers and longer tables together good beer oh yeah wine man you you Spanish people know exactly how to make wine I tell you well let me tell you I think uh Austrian people know how to make beer and and and other things uh uh I will say first of all I just want to say right off the top um that those people that don't know that they're watching the stump dish uh you know Jose is one of the most famous and extraordinary chefs in the world and not only because he is an extraordinary chef and not only because he started as a kid already with this business of learning how to be a chef and open the breast announce in in Spain that were very successful then moved to America with the age of 21 the same age I was when I moved uh to uh to America and then moved to New York first and then to the Washington and started with his Partners a whole bunch of wrestling unsuccessful restaurants so it's important for you guys to know that the followers of the storm dish that maybe it doesn't know so much about us say he's just an extraordinary successful restaurant and is you know is in the food in The Culinary business has his whole life he's very passionate about it has it been an award-winning chef and not only in World winning chef but also got the presidential medal from President Obama in 2015 for orifice extraordinary work and this is important now to for you to understand all of you that he is not just been so great with his you know restaurant business and all this but he said it's not just about me it's about we and this he had this idea of creating the world's Central Kitchen that those who of you that don't know about that there's an extraordinary idea that whenever there is a problem anywhere in the world it doesn't matter if it is an earthquake somewhere or if it is the fires like in California we had orders fires and all of a sudden he set up the world Central Kitchen in California within days he was here and organized and I was even up there I remember serving breakfast uh to our firefighters and all that stuff but so he's just unbelievable giving he gives back to the community and to his country into the world and all this stuff and this is what made him really famous now because everyone is just saying oh how can he do all of this so I just want to ask you my first question right off the top a do you know how many things we have in common Jose there'll be both immigrants till we both move to America with the age of 21 then we both became successful here in America we both already have been successful before we got here and we're passionate we both end up giving back we both are the chairs of the president's Council of physical fitness we both ended the environment and I can go on for the next hour about the things that we have in common and we both are good looking dudes let's be honest military service I could go on for hours and hours so my question is just you know what made you fall in love with the culinary business in the first place when you were a kid and you said okay my life will be about cooking food for people I want to be a chef how did you get into that and my dad were both nurses um my mom will be the one cooking more during the week um and my father are more on the weekends for more friends my father and love love to cook and feeding people my mom had more the love to feed in the family and making sure that my three brothers and I we will be fat for me growing up boys every morning will be walking on the bike going to the bakery to buy the bread the juice came hot out of the oven uh if I didn't behave a way for my mother to punish me will be not giving the opportunity to go in the morning to pick up the hot bread I will eat the bread halfway to my home because it was so good when it first happened so and so crispy so I I use watch my mom feeding us my father feeding us and friends and they always put so much love especially my mom with leftovers you know Governor I don't remember any dish on the beginning of the month when there was money because my father and mother used got the paycheck and you will see that they will buy and fill up the fridge but I remember when the fridge was empty at the end of the month my mother will be able to do amazing things out of nothing if she had some leftover bread crumbs bread she will make bread crumbs with it and she will then get whatever was the leftover boil egg or ham and she will make a bechamel everybody knows Bechamel flour and milk and you will make this kind of thick cream she will put whatever leftovers were in the fridge and then next day she will make balls and roll them on egg wash and the breadcrumbs and then she will fry them this is what in a Spam we call croquetas I learned that almost every country has like a version of of something raw and bread crumbs I I love those croquetas my brothers love those Croquettes so if you tell me the spirit of my mom and my dad be nurses that always you got this mentality we saw it during the pandemic that they always give back even beyond their duty to me they were I always knew that nurses and doctors were always Heroes because we don't realize the amazing work uh they do unfortunately we had to have a pandemic to realize how important they are in in our our society but then also to see the love that my mom will put feeding my brothers and I and the love that my father will put cooking big pots of rice of paella for anybody in the hospital my father always say that if there is that big problems have very simple Solutions uh if more people show up he will say use add more rice to the pen and problem will be solved so I think for me cooking was something I saw as something like brought people together that that made families better not perfect but better because cooking together kind of you become a stronger and very very very difficult everybody has a way to to explain it but but you setting up the table sitting um doesn't matter how good or bad the dish was use the effort that and the love that was put into the cooking is what is some of the best memories I have yeah but I mean what's interesting about it is it's really fascinating you know to see that your mother was a nurse and your father was a nurse and they all worked together in the hospital and all that stuff and that's what got you into food and into cooking and becoming a chef but there's millions and millions of chefs out there but only very few that are having the business mind and the real power and the vision all of a sudden to go and says I'm going to use this talent and I'm going to create a business and I'm going to be self-employed and I'm gonna go and take that risk and take investors in and to be partners in the office and start opening it's a very risky thing to do to go into a business yourself right rather than working for someone and having no headaches and just going to work so what what made that bridge what built that bridge then obviously you say I'm going to go into America and I'm going to go and open my breast around and I'm going to be a famous restaurant there on the successful one well for me America was something I always saw through the movies uh in in a way you are responsible through through movies that I wanted to be part of America where everything's impossible when I came I came to America first uh before I was 21 uh on the Spanish Navy I came sailing in a ship and I saw the amazing American flag and um what the symbols I remember be next to Ellis Island and Lady Liberty and I'm like I wanna I wanna be part of America so when I finish my military service uh I got the opportunity to come to New York to be a a cook in a restaurant and and I came to learn and I came to be experiencing everything that America seems was offering which was the freedom if you were hard to become whatever you wanted and when I arrived Washington DC I came I was 23. this is 1993 I moved from New York that I arrived like a young boy where everything was learning New York for me was like the perfect melting pot was not only the perfect melting pot but the perfect university for a cook that wants to learn about cooking in New York I could learn about every single restaurant cooking of any country and region from anywhere around the world I became a better cook because being in Manhattan but when I arrived DC I was offered this job by amazing people that they always made sure that my success was their success and I use began doing what I know how to do I say I don't I don't open business I don't open restaurants I am a storyteller how do I tell stories the only way I know I tell stories through the dishes that made me who I am behind every dish is a story behind every dish is people that made that dish happen without realizing I was a cook but without realizing I also realize that I could be a storytelling a Storyteller telling people where I came from through the dishes I was putting on the menu it's fantastic but I mean what is the amazing thing is not only did you uh become a great chef and then it became a great restaurant there and let this restaurant that everyone that says has thousands and thousands of fans that are coming back and coming back and eating their and and all this but I mean at what point did you get this idea well I want to do even more work as if you were not already working hard enough working 15 hours a day with those restaurants but you say I want to add to this work and I want to create the world Central Kitchen how did that happen did you decided that there's so many people out there that need food there's war zones they need food there's fires there's earthquakes there's problem there's there's Flats in this this misery around the world I gotta go and feed those people I mean how did that come about I mean what was your drive to give something back at the same time I arrived uh uh Washington DC Governor I began volunteering in organization called DC Central Kitchen this is Central Kitchen was amazing because was firing food waste which we know has a lot to do with global warming bringing that food that was untouched and actually it happened on uh Ronald Reagan Inauguration Day the day was funded the 35 plus years ago but take a look what happened here the guy that founded this rubber Egger was a bartender and he saw that food waste was not really the only problem the problem is that we were wasting people's lives so he brought the food that was untouched and really ready to throw garbage and he brought the people to a kitchen began training the people to become Cooks those Cooks will make sure that the food waste was no food waste but food opportunity and making meals to feed the Homeless population of Washington DC I became a volunteer I became the chairman of the organization I learned so much watching how a plate of food could be really an agent of change not throwing money at the problem but investing into the solutions you as a governor knows this very well we were fighting food waste giving opportunity to people training them feeding the homeless and in the process finding jobs to those men and women that once they graduated after the training will join the ranks of different restaurants around the sea brilliant but at the same time I was watching what happened in Katrina at the same time I was watching in the distance how we left a man and woman sometimes like in the Superdome four days without food and water the system was overwhelmed because sometimes government cannot do it all everybody forgets that government is only as good as its citizens and FEMA who is organization in charge of providing response and bringing different ngos to make it happen in certain events could be overwhelmed that's when actually didn't began really in the States but when Haiti happened the big hurray the big earthquake in 2010 I said you know this is Mayor I am a cook and when you have an emergency you send nurses and doctors to take care of the Wounded you send the firefighters to take care of the fires but when you have to feed people in an emergency who do you think is the most prepared people those are Cooks of the wall so I went to Haiti and is when wall Central Kitchen was created without realizing over the last 14 years we've been in so many places in the fires in California in Ventura and some other places in the volcano in Hawaii and in the volcano and Guatemala we've been in the war in Ukraine we've been uh in the earthquake in turkey and Syria we've been in the in Bahamas after Dorian at the end it's a very simple thing what we do governor uh in the way we see it every restaurant every Chef every cook every volunteer every person that drives a car and can deliver uh every every helicopter pilot uh everybody belongs to wall Sandra kitchen what happened they don't know a jet we go to a place and we are able to feed people quickly and fast because we use local resources we use the local assets and more important we allow the locals to join us because nobody knows better than the locals at the end with the people we become one we are able to reach 1 million meals a day in matter of days in a very organized sometimes illogical way but in a way that we don't come with a plan we adapt adaptation is I would say the trademark of world Central Kitchen if you have a plan you will fail because every emergency is different but if you are that to every emergency you can always respond that's a matter of what happens well I I I think that you're giving government a little bit too much of a break here because I think it was a disastrous performance in the government's part when it comes to some of those emergencies and to me I don't think it's an excuse to say that the government gets overwhelmed but you didn't get overwhelmed you didn't get over you weren't there and you've heard the people and you were organized and you were helping they were frozen for weeks they were frozen until they did something about it and I think that happens to a lot of places where there's emergencies and I think that this important thing is is to just really be willing to go in there of course as you said for you and for government for everyone it's the same thing every emergency is different you don't know when you go to Ukraine how are you going to put everyone together you don't know when you go to Haiti uh you know how to pull everyone together and to know all the chefs and bring them together you did not know when you came to California how to pull all of this together and what did the firefighters really need and what time do they eat and all of those kind of things but you did it you adopted very quickly to the situation you did it but the government has sometimes has a real difficult time in doing that and so I think just the world of the things that you're doing and my question is just you know of at what point did you find out that the environment is something that benefits here with all of this when you say talk about food waste because you're absolutely right I mean for for decades and decades restaurants threw food away and they never even saw the Synergy that we could actually use this food and feed those that need food there's so many hungry people that every city has that the homeless people that are out there that need to have food and oils and then eventually someone comes up with this plan to use actually this food that is not to make it a waste but actually to make it an asset and to feed people I mean and then that has an environmental kind of connection because food waste creates a huge amount of greenhouse gases and pollution in the world and for you to kind of cut that down by using it how did you come up with that idea and at what time did all of a sudden the environment become important to you well uh uh I'm going to put the environment front and center in public domain we saw vice president Gore doing the same people like you are people that they they've helped create in people like me this mentality that obviously the environment is very important uh but one of the things I've been saying lately for a few years now is that I don't believe we are giving food the importance it deserves I believe that food only sits at the Department of Agriculture at the USDA and seems the Department of Agriculture event does amazing things uh it's good lunches and the farm bill sometimes it's there at the service of of the very big companies which by the way I want to have a very big company I have no problems with very big companies but they don't want big companies taking advantage of subsidies when the small farmers can't I don't want the big restaurant chains take advantage of those subsidies in the way a smaller restaurants can and you're gonna tell me Jose what this has to do with environment everything has to do with environment because I am realizing that one of the biggest factors we have and one of the areas that becomes a problem is food food is the reason why we have hunger or the lack of it lack of Distribution food is the reason why we have health issues obesity and all the other sickness that happens because over eating uh food is the one that in many ways is putting a lot of CO2 in the process of feeding uh Humanity in the way we produce Foods is one of the reasons why we are contaminating our waterways and our oceans because we are contaminating our oceans food is also scarce because without oxygen like in the Gulf of Mexico all of the sudden you see only but dead fish in the beaches all across the world at the end food is everything food is defense for this energy for this immigration reform cannot be that the people that feed America and the people that feed the world some times cannot feed themselves cannot be that we have 11 million undocumented working in farms in America but we are not able to give them once and for all the right to belong no ghost of the system but people that with work permits or green cards or whatever is that the Democrats and Republicans agree we will give them finally the decency to belong to America so at the end what I was trying to say is that food is so important that I I've been calling for a long time to presidents around the world that we need to have National Security food advisors next to every governor next to every president because there are a lot of problems that we create in the way we manage food when actually food can be an amazing opportunity to solve problems from the CO2 emissions to hunger 2 two obesity two etc etc food is the solution food must stop being the problem and the environment will be one of the biggest beneficiaries used to end you know what is one of the biggest contributors of CO2 and in the process also makes people poor the way people feed themselves the way people cook actually almost three billion people three billion people cook with charcoal with fossil fuels they cook with three rocks on the floor and some wood or some charcoal in the process of feeding themselves they're making themselves unhealthy they're making themselves poorer and they're making they're cutting down the trees and they're making pollution happening more and more one of the biggest opportunities we have and this is what I would love for you in your next conference that you are living in Austria talking about environmental issues is that the the issue about the kitchens clean kitchens that will fit the wall we will be a very important issue that you will talk because I do believe if we provide every family in the world with a clean kitchen like you and I have a home we can help to have better better climate we we will fight CO2 emissions we will fight poverty we will find Hunger we will fight deforestation we will fight so many things just by having cleaner technology for cooking and feeding every family around the world I think this is a brilliant idea and we definitely will bring this up in our discussion with our environmental conference at our time at conference in Vienna in May and tell you one thing that uh I think it's a good idea what you had about recommending uh for governments to have their own food advisory person there but I just want to suggest to you to let the private sector set up those advice prices and not government because otherwise it's a political appointment and they will not be able to go and solve the problems again just like it was with any of the disasters so I think the private sector should set that up but I think it's a brilliant idea and I also hope that you will be there at our conference one time and talk about all of the issues that you care about I want to give you an invitation today to come if it's this year May 16th is our conference in Vienna and because I think it is such an important issue you know the environment is something I'm very passionate about but we have to address the environmental issue just like you said from so many different angles if it is you know what kind of cars do we drive you know what kind of a power do we generate is it from fossil fuels or is it power that is renewable ended from a renewable energy and all of this kind of things it's the what what transportation system should we have how do we go and eliminate you know the pollution that kills seven million people a year is really the question and there's indoor pollution as you have talked about charcoal about food and all this stuff it's also there's just millions of people still in some of the third world countries that have stoves inside their home and they're burning in a corn and they're burning wood and they're inhaling this exhaust and certain the pollution so that they die from in inside pollution air pollution so I think there's so many issues we have to talk about I love you taking the food so I hope that you can go and join us one time

      "corpus": "you know it was Oscar Wilde who once said I can resist anything but temptation now we all know what it's like to be tempted and sometimes we feel as though maybe we're being tempted above our capacity to resist but the fact of the matter is the Bible says in First Corinthians 10 13 there is no temptation taking you but such as his Common Man and God who is faithful will not allow you to be tempted above your ability to resist but will with the Temptation make a way of Escape that you may be able to bear it lose paraphrase there's always a way out of every Temptation remember when Jesus was tempted in the wilderness the devil showed Christ all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time and said this is mine I can give it to whomever I choose and if you will worship me I'll give it to you now Jesus comes back with the scripture and says it is written you shall Worship the Lord God in him only shall you serve the Devil comes to Jesus after he'd been fasting for 40 days and 40 nights and says of a rock why don't you turn it into a piece of bread and Jesus said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of god notice how Jesus quotes scripture now Jesus could have used executive privilege he could have gotten himself out of this situation if he had wanted to but instead he faced it as a human being showing us how to face Temptation and what did he do every time he was tempted Christ quoted the Bible saying again in again it is written the best way to resist temptation is to know and act on scripture in Psalm 119 the psalmist says how will a young man cleanse his way answer by taking heed to your word later on in the same Psalm he says your word if I hid in my heart that I might not sin against you hey it's great to carry a Bible in your briefcase or your backpack or your purse but the best place to carry the word of God is in your heart I encourage you to memorize scripture I still love verses one of which I quoted a few moments ago First Corinthians 10 13 And I memorized when I was a young man and I still remember today as well an old man so memorize the word of God and the next time you're tempted remember there's always a way out okay"

disability and I had a lot of trouble in school socialization was very challenging for me and so my parents bought me a workout set for the gym and just having that physical outlet for me is what I needed my grades got better I started making more friends in school and it just it radically changed my life after getting saved I was introduced to a man named Rob Moore and so Rob became my mentor and he said God gave me this vision for you and he said in this Vision I saw you working with kids that had disabilities and you were training them didn't know anything about business I knew I wanted to start this company working with special needs and providing Fitness training to them and so in 2016 I knew it was time to start special strong nobody else really in the world does this concept and it grew very fast we didn't have a lot of capital so we were taking out loans thinking we'll pay it off we thought it was a good debt and we didn't understand the curves of business and so we were in a very difficult position in 2018 we had more expenses than we had income we we knew that we needed help around that same time you know we were attending Gateway Church and we saw a commercial for Gateway Business Leaders and right away I knew that this was the answer to what I needed help for [Music] Gateway Business Leaders has been an incredible resource to me to really learn how to manage my business God's way these are biblical principles that last forever the sound strategies that I get from the curriculum and from the mentors that I have in the group really helped me navigate my business during some very difficult times that one-on-one attention that I received saved our business without a question John 10 10 says the enemy comes to steal kill and destroy and high Jesus came that they may have life and that they may have it more abundantly and the Lord spoke to me and he said Daniel that's my heart for this population that you're serving served over a thousand adaptive clients to date we're going to get to help thousands and thousands of additional clients who are in need of our services God is doing big things in special strong and we were excited about what's ahead for us and we were so thankful for the Gateway business leader group how they've helped us and how they're going to help us moving forward hey everyone how are you huh you're not that good huh oh okay all right well I do want to just say something about Gateway Business Leaders this is a vision that God gave me when we actually started the church and uh Steve Doolin who leads this ministry was one of the founding Elders of the church and he was in business and many of you have heard his testimony but he gave 50 percent of his income to the Lord and millions and millions of dollars and then retired at the age of 50. and um was helping businesses around the country and I said I Steve I need you to do it here at Gateway we need to help Business Leaders and so this is a Ministry that we have I was talking to a businessman shortly after we started it and I said hey if you come to the Business Leaders Minister yet he said no I I know that that's uh you know a Ministry I need to support and I said no you don't we didn't start it for you to support it we started it for to support you and so if you're in any type of business which most of you are I don't most of you are not pastors and Vocational ministers so you're in business uh we want you to come and to the Business Leaders get involved but also accelerate on May 18th so we have a conference it's a one day conference what are the times again 9 30 to 3 30 um and uh Henry cloud is speaking David Green Hobby Lobby uh Kelly Shackleford and Steve and I'll be speaking so sign up come if you're in business uh you'll you'll make more money taking that one day off come to that conference and you will work and I can just tell you that because God will help you and teach you that's why we're doing it all right I also want to remind you about voting uh we started uh a while back with some uh Pastors in the area mainly in the South Lake Grapevine Colleyville Keller area and we started just uh saying hey we just want to know if there's someone in the family of churches that's running for school board or city council so there was someone in your family that was you know running for office you'd want to know so we let you know we don't endorse candidates we don't support candidates or political party and we pray for everyone we pray for every candidate we also pray for everyone who's serving on the school board our city council these are extremely important elections and so I just show you uh you can do it take a picture you can see it later some slides if you're in one of these cities here are some people that are running that are a member of the family of churches in this area all right and so I want you to pray for them and pray for everyone that's running but the main thing I want you to do is vote so early voting ends this Tuesday and vote uh you can vote if you can do early voting next Saturday so it's very very important that we vote for city council and for school board members and that we pray for them all right everyone with me on that okay it's important that we determine what our children are going to learn and um that we and that we do that by voting for them um men's Summit was sort of good this year it was incredible it was awesome and so uh guys I would just say to you make sure you sign up early because it sells out every year by the way last weekend I spoke in the four o'clock service at the South Lake Campus and then got on a plane and flew to Georgia and spoke two Sunday morning services for Jensen Franklin and then Sunday night went to the memorial for Dr Charles Stanley and when they heard I was coming they asked me to speak and to share a little bit so you can even see it it's online if you just looked at the moral because I opened the it up right after a song and an introduction by Dr George who's the pastor now of First Baptist Atlanta and so I shared a few comments and then opened in prayer but uh Dr Charles Stanley was a great great man of God and a great Bible teacher he taught the Bible uh so it was a wonderful wonderful wonderful to be there and uh Dr George spoke also Dr David Jeremiah and uh Franklin Graham spoke at it all right so we are in a uh uh a series called simplify and if you think about it uh simplify comes from the word simple now if I asked you to describe your life many of you would not use the word simple as a matter of fact you would use the antonym of the word which is complicated or busy or hectic and that's the way it is uh I though uh am a simple person God allows me to take complicated theological issues to make them simple and you think I do this great job teaching but the reason I do it is because I can't understand it unless I make it simple so I have to make it simple for me you know the number one comment I get I hear when I'm out and I get to meet people is they will say to me our children like to listen to you well it's because we're on the same level so I'm just a a simple guy I I can only do one thing at once my wife knows that if I'm you know doing something I I can just do one thing I literally uh a few months ago when my daughter Elaine was here we were going over her message and she her phone went off she picked it up and and she she was talking she said and then I'm going to go to Matthew and then I'm going to be talking when I'm in Matthew I'll be talking I don't know if they have a a a thumb teaching class to be able to text that fast unbelievable and she's telling me she's Matthew and then she put her phone back down a little while later she said then I'll be over in Luke and on Two And the phone went off and so she did this again I said well what did you just do she said well I had one text that were there wondering how many communion cups to order for this weekend and then I had another text about you know we need to order some more baptismal robes and I tell them how many do that she can do like 107 things at once I can't do that uh uh when I was growing up it was just I could it was just one thing at once I mean that's that's just for me that's just kind of the the way I was I remember trying to juggle and um I I couldn't do it I I finally I did learn how to juggle one ball and so I could just juggle that one ball unless a bird flew by and I got distracted you know I did do something that I thought this is kind of interesting when I think about one that I could only do one thing it works once I learned how to ride a unicycle it has one tire so I I don't know that that's just the way I am okay so so but here we're told in Scripture to simplify our lives and we're told what the Apostle Paul was afraid of his fear and I read it to you out of another version New American Standard last week I'm gonna read a new King James this week second Corinthians 11 3 but I fear I fear this is Paul speaking lest somehow as the serpent deceived Eve and we talked about how did he do it last weekend by his craftiness his sophisticated trickery so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ the Simplicity in last week new America said the Simplicity of devotion so we talked about the enemy of devotion so we're going to talk this week about the secret of Simplicity all right and even in the first point I'm going to give it to you but then we're just going to get simpler and simpler through the message all right so here's number one The Secret of Simplicity is love that's why he said the Simplicity of Devotion to Christ The Secret of Simplicity is love now they're 1189 chapters in the Bible uh 31 103 verses in the Bible and around 800 000 words in the Bible about six hundred and twenty thousand Old Testament about 180 something maybe 189 000 I'd have to go back and count but anyway in the New Testament but about eight hundred thousand words eight hundred thousand words and Jesus boiled the whole Bible down to one word and I'll show it to you all right Matthew 22 but when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees they gathered together and then one of them a lawyer asked them a question that's the last person you won't ask in your question except Jesus he can handle it so testing him and saying teacher which is the great commandment in the law now I know many of you I know the Ten Commandments but there were 613 Commandments in the Lord so there there are the Ten Commandments but there are 613 Commandments Jesus said to him you shall love love he boasts the whole Bible down to one word you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like it you shall you wanna just say that out loud love your neighbor as yourself on these two Commandments that's one of the most amazing verses in the Bible Matthew 22 40 spoken by Jesus the author fetish of our faith the word of God himself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets now it's important to understand that uh the law refers to the first five books of the Old Testament and the prophets refer to the other books the major and minor prophets and then some would say called the Psalms put that in another category and that's fine but that's the way they referred to the Bible the law and the prophets and I don't think we think about this but when Jesus was talking right then and when when the Epistles were being written okay just stay with me on this all right remember I told you that I'm real I'm kind of well known for making simple statements that are smart okay they didn't have the New Testament they were the New Testament so every time Jesus quotes the scriptures he's quoting the Old Testament every time every time Paul quotes the scripture when he says as the scripture says as the scripture says as the scripture says he's grown ill now I believe in the inspiration of the New Testament I believe the whole Bible is inspired I believe that all the new obviously I'm just simply saying that Jesus at that time is saying you can sum up the whole Bible because that's the only Bible they had when he made that statement you can you cannot sum it all up with just these two Commandments love God and love people which that would be one word love love God and love people The Ten Commandments I've told you before divided into two categories the first four have to do with loving God the last six have to do with loving people summed up in those two Commandments love God and love people see Satan's goal is to get us focused on doing rather than being and I would like to remind you that you are not a human doing you're a human being you say so so what does that mean because he said You shall love the Lord God and you shall love your neighbors yourself the reason I'm saying that is is because you can't do that without Christ but you can be that the Fruit of the Spirit is love now love your peace okay long suffering goodness meaning and standard Faith all self-control okay okay but the fruit of the spirit listen it doesn't say the fruit of Robert Robert's just the tree I don't produce love God produces love so when I'm telling you this I'm not telling you something you need to do I'm telling some I'm telling you someone you need to know and his name is Jesus and he is love and we are so busy today we this is what Paul this is what Paul said this just is I'm eating up with this that Paul said I'm afraid of one thing that you get away from the Simplicity of Devotion to Christ and you know who's going to try to get you away from it Satanist he's going to do it the same way he did it with Eve think about it today I mean first of all if you have a job your life's complicated if you're married it's more complicated if you have children you're done I mean you've got soccer and football and dance and and and you know volleyball and and ballet and piano and that's just one week and sometimes just one day and if you get if you have five or six kids I have no clue how you do it everybody's got to go somewhere your job though is not to be a chauffeur even though you think it is at this time your job is just to love God and love others that's it it's just summed up it's just so cool so I said the secret of Simplicity is love but I'm going to keep boiling it down you say okay the secret of Simplicity is love so what's the secret of love so point two is the secret of Love is commitment that's the secret of love if you want to love God you stay committed matter of fact Jesus even said if you love me keep my Commandments you know what he was saying stay committed if you love me be committed so the secret of Love is commitment and yet all the movies that we see focus on falling in love and then you can fall out of love as a matter of fact I I can I can tell you every uh romance comedy Every Love Story the plot is they fall in love they fall out of love then they fall back in love I mean that's what's going to happen so I can sleep during the middle of them because I know what's going to happen but all Hollywood is doing is describing the feelings that you have when you begin to make a commitment to someone that's what Falling in Love Is when you yes someone asks you to uh come to uh a function at church with them okay so we're going to keep this on the up and up we're not gonna go dancing or anything else right now all right we're gonna they asked you to go to a function at church and so you go you make a commitment to go and you spend some time talking to them and they have similar interests similar likes they have good character and so then as you go to another function at church where just everything's going to be a church all these dates okay they're all at church okay and you go so you make another commitment you commit and what happens is the more you commit the more you love you follow me and then when you get married you just make another commitment you fall more in love you need to know by the way um devote we talked last week he said the Simplicity of Devotion to Christ now I can I can figure out uh the meanings of just about any word simply by going to the root word and a lot of people just don't do this I don't know why I don't I think it's like the most simplest thing in the world to do like Simplicity the word would be simple okay but devote what's you know the root of devote is vote that's the root but people don't even know what vote means I'm telling you y'all go vote and we don't know what it means you know what vote means it means vow it comes from a Latin word Vata vadam it's one vatam I think is the way they say it vatam uh it just means Val you see when you vote for a referendum or a candidate you're vowing to support that candidate or that referendum it's a vow so here's what he's saying I'm afraid that the serpent is going to deceive you and you get away from being simply committed to Jesus Christ you made a foul I just want you to keep that now but by the way that's the reason that they put vowels in wedding ceremonies because they discovered a long time ago that the only way you'd ever stay in love is if you kept a commitment and and you probably never even thought about it but the vowels are not that romantic basically you say I promise to say committed to you if you get sick poor and make my life worse in on doors of the house sickness and in health richer poor better or worse I was counseling with a couple one time and I said so let me get this straight you feel like that since you've been married your life has become worse he said yeah I said that's what you signed up for I think this is the reason people say to me now we'd like to write our own vows I was counseling one of the young men in the church when the church was really small about 100 people probably and um his fiancee had broken up with him and so he's heartbroken you know and so uh he and I were talking I I was meeting with him and I said to him hey this is the best thing could have ever happened to you and he said well what do you mean I said well she she doesn't love you because if she loved you she would have stayed committed to you and what's great is that you love her you were committed to her but I said how long have y'all been dating he said about a year I said this is wonderful I said what if you'd been married for 10 or 20. Your Love would have grown because your commitment would have grown and your heart would have been more broken and let me give you better news because many people have gone through something like this but please let me give you really good news the bad news is it takes two people to make a marriage work but the good news is Jesus came to heal the brokenhearted so if you've had your heart broken he can heal your broken heart [Applause] and so I told him I said listen it just means God has someone good for you that's going to be committed to you and so the next week we got together again to meet and he said you know he said God spoke to me just like just like what you said basically he said I was sitting in church and during worship he said I was just worshiping God he said I looked over and I saw this older couple in our church and you know he had his left hand up she had a right hand up and in the middle they were holding hands and he said the Lord said to me that's what I want for you and I've got someone just like that picked out for you that you're going to be able to grow old with and so I thought see that's wonderful and then I thought about it so we were only about like 100 people again remember we only had one older couple in our church and and I we had just started the church I was 38 when I started the church so I'm like 39 years old you know maybe 40 at that time and so I said to him because I knew this old disc couple they were in their 70s they were the only people we hadn't you know in their set over 70 you know so I said hey was it this couple because everybody knew everybody you know well we were like a big life group when we started you know so I said so was it this couple that you saw when you said you saw an older couple he said oh not that old I mean someone your age so I uh uh kicked him out of the church but anyway it's [Applause] no you know what's funny is now he's in his 40s you so you're old so there's this love story in the Bible and let me just it's between uh a man named Boaz and a woman named Ruth books named Ruth okay so it's it's easy to remember but Boaz falls in love with her like we say he fell in love but you know why because he tells her why she asked him why are you even taking notice of me let me show you the answer Ruth 2 verse 10. so she fell on her face bowed down to the ground and said to him why have I found favor in your eyes that you should take notice of me since I'm a foreigner and Boaz answered and said to her it has been fully reported to me all that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband okay here's what he said he was saying you're a woman of commitment and that's the kind of person I want to be married to I want to be married to someone that I can commit my life to and that will commit her life to me and I have heard it's been fully reported to me that you made a commitment to your mother-in-law as a matter of fact did you know that her commitment to her mother-in-law this is she she marries you know this man and then he dies and so Naomi then says to her just go back to your own country now and she says no and she says this wherever you go I'll go your people will be my people your God will be my God and then this what she says till death do us part and that got in the wedding vows she was basically saying I'm committed you Boaz is looking for a wife and he says you know what I want I want someone committed I want someone who's committed so you know I got saved nine months after Debbie and I got married but I started trying to get my life right with God when I was 16. and um so I I the guy that uh helped me started getting my life right with God was actually James Robinson's best man in his wedding and he's the one that introduced Debbie me to James and Betty before we even got married but he saw this gift in me so he was helping trying to get me to you know get right with God and he said you you need to um uh he was taught he was mentoring and he said you need to start you need to um he was I remember him thinking how do I say this he said you need to date um some better girls and I thought the girls I'm dating are pretty good you know so I I because I was lost yeah maybe I was lost okay okay I was lost and he said no no no I mean you need data good girl you need dated girl you want to be married to you know you need to you need to and so I remember looking around the church and there there were there were good girls and Debbie was one of them and she was the most beautiful one there obviously of all the good girls and so I I asked her out for a date and uh 15 20 years after we'd been married I remember asking edra because I didn't have reputations being a good boy you know and I said to edger her mom I said why why in the world did you let your daughter ever go out with me and this is what she said see my mother's mother grew up I mean she lived in our home when I was growing up we took her in and my she said this is why because during choir practice when your mother and I were in choir your father would bring your mother's mother his mother-in-law in and set her down and hold her hand and make sure she was seated and take care of her and then he would go do his things he did all sorts of things in the church you know helping run the sound and being a deacon and all these other things and then he would come and get her afterwards and take her and he said she said I watched your father and I thought there's got to be something way down deep that's good in here [Applause] but here's what she did she actually saw how my father treated his mother-in-law and I think she thought maybe he'll treat me good when okay so anyway hopefully I am treating you okay all right so so the secret of Simplicity is Love The Secret Of Love is commitment so what's the secret of commitment here's Point number three The Secret of commitment is choice now this is extremely important and I'm going to get a little theological in you one of the number one theological questions that pastors are asked is why did God even put the knowledge of the tree of Good and Evil in the garden as if God had done something wrong and as if God was setting them up for failure kind of judging God and it's exactly opposite again same reason I talked last week why he drove them out once they ate from it because they were in a fallen State he didn't want him to live forever in that Fallen state so why did he even put two trees in the midst of the garden the tree of life and the tree of death in essence why did he do that here's why because you can't have love if you don't have choice robots can't love God didn't want robots he could have created you without a will and without a choice but he wanted you to know love if you didn't have a choice you wouldn't know love you would know what it's like to be loved or to be loved or to love someone else you wouldn't know you would never know you have to have choice to have love this this you have to under you have to get this so what we're talking about here is to be simplify your life and I'm getting it down just very simply for you here's how you simplify your life you just choose to love God and when you choose to love him then you're going to commit to him and when you commit to him then your life's going to be simplified it's that simple it's that simple again I talked about uh Debbie and we got married I was 18 when we got married and so um it was after my freshman year of college I graduated high school in 17 and we dated our junior senior of high school and then freshman year of college and then we got married so I was 18 years old and um but and not shortly not long after we got uh married then we moved to Dallas and uh I started meeting people we started meeting people our age of course 19 20 21 22 that they weren't married yet and we started meeting some more successful people and all of a sudden this insecurity came out in me because we were meeting these men who were smarter than I more talented more gifted better looking richer better jobs and I remember thinking I know Debbie chose me you know we grew up in a smaller town I know she chose me then but there were only three choices and the other two didn't have jobs but now she's meeting better looking nicer Kinder I wasn't kind I was still growing in my relationship with the Lord I didn't have kindness I didn't have the fruits of the spirit and and it wasn't successful and I just I just thought I just she's meeting these men she's going to figure out that she's got other choices and it it scared me to death and we we were talking one time because I was so I was so jealous if she talked if she just you know if another man was just safe they were just having a conversation across the room at a get-together or something I'm just I'm saying what was he talking to you about you know I was just and she just had to say to me you have to understand I love you I love you now here's why she loved me because she chose to make a commitment to me you follow me and I still didn't understand it then I've had to grow in that and to to finally figure out I know I know she loves me because she's made thousands of choices over the years to stay committed you have to you have to catch this for first John 2 15 says do not love the world or the things in the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him okay why would he say don't love the world if love isn't a choice see this thing about I just I just fell in love with it yeah let me ask you this anyone here anyone ever made an impulse purchase okay yeah all of you and this is what we say I just I just fell in love with it no you didn't you made a commitment to it and now you owe Visa more money than you can pay because you made a commitment and you wish you could go back on your commitment and you might even wear it and keep the tag on it so you can take it back I'm I just want to help you you say I want to simplify my life okay just choose to love God and love other people it's it's that simple now you may have to take some weights off your board I talked about stress one time you may have to do something I understand there are other things you may need to see a counselor you may need to work through some emotional health issues that you have some mental health issues that you might have you have to work through some things with your childhood but if you make a choice to love God you'll simplify your life I'm going to tell you another one more story about uh Debbie when we um uh you know I've been around where we didn't have cell phones you know we didn't have cell phones growing up and then cell phones came out and only people had them were people that could Mount them in their car they were mounted in the car and then they came out with the I won't say have any of you remember this bag phones did anyone here have a bagged phone a look yeah I had one too careback made me feel so important to most of my phone my phone yeah that cares here if they weighed about 40 pounds and then they came out with the walkie-talkie motorolas remember those huge and then they came out with the Star Trek beam me up Scotty phone just flip it open look how cool I am I got a flip phone and so by then you know I saw I got Debbie this phone okay well she was running the women's minister at the church and and you know and then she would go to lunch with you know some ladies or our team or whatever but I got offended because she wouldn't answer her phone now she didn't she didn't like to keep it on rain because then she'd be in a meeting you know and um and then or she'd be at lunch with her women's team or something you know and so she put on vibrate here's the difference that I had to figure out but it took me a while to figure it out man we we carry our phones in our pocket right vibrates we feel it women carry their phones in their purse so they don't know so she she again we're in our early 40s okay I'm still working through all these insecurities so I'd call she wouldn't answer and I just got more and more insecure more and more rejected angrier and I just think well you know if you don't care enough to answer your phone I don't care enough to leave a voicemail and if you don't care enough to answer your phone when not call I don't care enough to answer my phone when you call him I just started getting offended very offended she just she doesn't she doesn't love me she didn't answer the phone and so we finally talked about she said I just don't hear it but when she realized that it was important to me she would take her phone out and set it on the table in the women's team meeting and she would say and I just want you to know something if if Robert calls me I'm answering this phone and I'm not answering it because I'm the women's Pastor because he's the senior pastor I'm answering it because he's the love of my life he's much more important to me than all of you and I just met with a pastor this last week flew in from California just so he could meet with me for a couple of hours and I do the same thing this day and my team can do the same thing I put the phone right there and I say to them I say to my team and I said to this pastor is once you know if Debbie calls I'm answering this phone and can I tell you why it's because we're committed we're she is more important than any meeting that I'm going to be in and here's the wonderful thing even get married at 18 and me not even knowing Christ then and all the silliness that I've told you that I've gone through the insecurities and the inferiorities this week this week is our 43rd wedding anniversary love is not that hard it's just choosing to make a commitment to not get offended over the little things or the big things I want you to Bow your heads and close your eyes the whole Bible Jesus said summed up in just two Commandments love God and love other people love God and love people I want you to do just like we do every weekend Holy Spirit what are you saying to me Lord what are you saying to me through this message just take a moment just say Lord what are you saying to me through this message just take a moment and he may answer you right now or he might answer you Tuesday in your quiet time or some other time or just driving down the road and you might think I'm going to listen that message again and the Holy Spirit speaks something to you just let the Lord speak to you because we've got the most incredible apostle that wrote a third of the New Testament saying let me tell you what I'm afraid of I'm afraid that in the same way the serpent deceived Eve your minds would be drawn away corrupted from the simplicity of Devotion to Christ it's so simple to love Jesus and that is you just choose to keep your commitment to him Lord I pray for all of us that when the big choices come up and when the little choices come up we're going to choose to stay committed to you in Jesus name amen [Applause] I'm going to ask you stand out with me and I want us to consider this time as a time to connect with God I know that sometimes our volunteers have to exit the room and we got to get set for what's coming after but this is a moment that is Holy because we get to connect with the Lord and ask Lord what are you saying to me and what are you speaking into my heart I'm going to ask our prayer team to come forward and I want to say to you maybe today the Lord is saying you need to recommit

front so if that's you would you just start coming this way just come we're gonna stay here as long as necessary whatever you need health whatever it is come enjoying your hands with somebody and pray

stadiums in size that just gets thrown into landfills drastically damaging the environment so on one side we have so much waste and on the other we have to people globally that just need a simple t-shirt which boils down to many factors and exactly why I put our team and all our resources into getting as many unused and overproduced clothes as possible away from ending up in landfills and rather into the hands of people around the world that need it the most so we reached out to our friends at champion who quickly jumped on board with a massive donation as well as Bridgewater and in total they donated more than 2.7 million dollars worth of clothing we are now headed to the Hopi reservation in northern Arizona that dates all the way back to the 12th century where they have built their traditional Sandstone villages on top of these massive Rocky Cliffs and are in desperate need of our help to stay warm during their cold winter months on arrival Darren met with Wendy who is at the Forefront of enhancing the lives of her fellow tribe members and has been struggling to do so for so many years there are over 10 000 members of the Hopi tribe the term Hopi refers to Peaceful people taught to be caretakers of the land these people don't have very much that they're some of the most generous people you'll ever meet the ability to just have immediate access to things it's not there for us the Hopi tribe is situated hundreds of miles away from the closest Quality clothing and food stores which is bad because the winters here get freezing cold and they need all the help they can get to stay warm and put food on the table people are salvaging what they have as far as heating resources they can't freely burn the wood that they've bought because of the cost of it when we first got here I realized how big the task ahead of us was the quantity of clothing that was being delivered as a cow are we ever going to get through this people had driven from all over the state hours and hours away to come and help us prepare for this distribution I was first at the understanding that we were going to get some clothing we'll get a palette or two and when I was told the amount I was like wow that's going to be huge because they have to travel so far people don't even have cars then I started realizing how much this meant to these people foreign [Music] [Music] just seeing everybody's excitement like wow this is not only new clothes but this is a really really nice clothes it was amazing our kids our people are just so happy it means a lot to us to not only want to give to us but to also want to learn about who we are I'm a big believer of signs my eyes are probably all red rain in the summer snow in the winter is what we want so when we finished you know sharing with peaceful entropy and the snow fell right when it was done I took that as these people were supposed to be here and they're good people I'm always going to be thankful for that thank you Mr bees maybe some of the youth will realize there are people out there who think about them I think a lot of times they feel like they've been forgotten we were so moved by the Hopi people that we wanted to help them even more and when speaking to their Community we found out that they also struggled with food insecurity so we brought in 13 tons of fresh and non-perishable foods which will help reduce their food shortage problem and provide them with 25 000 nutritious meals you can make an ongoing significant impact in the lives of the Hopi people by clicking the Donate button down below and 100 of proceeds from the Donate button will go to the Hopi Relief Fund after visiting Arizona we decided to send the team to Detroit and to India to distribute even more clothing but before we get there I want to thank the sponsor of this video electric e-bikes whose mission is to change people's lives by increasing their Mobility while being energy efficient which is slightly contradictory to this plane but electric e-bikes doesn't yet make planes so for now I'm on one of their e-bikes which is really affordable and easy to use they have really stepped up to the plate this year and helped us do so much good like rebuilding an orphanage giving away 20 000 pairs of shoes and even traveling to three different cities to give clothes out to as many people as possible so click the link in the description below and please purchase one of their e-bikes so they can continue supporting us and helping us do more great projects like this in the future now let's go to India a massive shout out to these organizations on your screen they helped us out in India as well as the Metro Detroit youth group for helping us distribute the rest of the clothing to tens of thousands of people in need if you made it this far in the video let me know in the comment section below by saying I'm not a bad person I watch this video to help you make more money so you can help more people goodbye

like this is really important and I've been procrastinating this for like two weeks procrastinated [Music] see procrastination is dangerous [Music] procrastination poisons productivity right now if I didn't procrastinate I could have this job this video done by the end of the day I'm gonna I'm gonna go get lunch see I I think I spend 50 of my time procrastinating fifty percent of my time not working and then the other 50 of my time frantically working to make up for the time that I spent not working what's for lunch he said he wants chicken got chicken [Music] it's great intentions to sabotage by compulsive inaction thank you [Music] how do you deal with procrastination I embraced it I go with it what does that mean s wait until I can't wait anymore and then go really fast I don't know if that advice of waiting until the last minute to do things I don't know if that's good advice and I think about I think about the times when I made like feature films like a movie that's taken three or four years of my life for these huge projects and how much I've struggled with them because I lose focus I lose interest they stop they stop being interesting to me but then like when I had my daily Vlog I had a deadline every single day there was no opportunity within those years there's no opportunity for me to procrastinate and it worked do you see do you see my facial hair see much longer my beard is now than it was in the previous shots that's because I it's been a week that procrastinated this from a week this is a movie about procrastination that I've I've been procrastinating for a week [Music] hey dude just this and this please foreign [Music] this this is how I would describe the entirety of my professional life it's either a state of boredom wherein I want to do more or a state of burnout where I need to do less it's never ever in this healthy place in the middle it's it's one extreme or the other these two states these are destructive to the creative process and it's procrastination that enables these two states so I'll procrastinate which leads to boredom to fix that I need to I need to do more which leads me to kind of burn out I need to remedy that by doing less so I start to procrastinate then I get bored I need to fix that so I frantically do more and I get stuck in this Vicious Circle [Music] this crazy space alien technology from insta360 is the um is the sponsor of this video and I use this thing for a lot of shots uh in this movie see how it's following me it's doing that by itself so I can move over here and I can even go behind the tree and it still follows me very impressive very impressive stuff [Music] so it's called the insta360 flow and at its core it is a a three axis gimbal for for your phone but I've had it for a few weeks now and it's become something it's become something more for me it's like having a cameraman that's smart and does exactly as it's told all by itself see 99 of my videos I just shoot by myself and I'm always looking for technology or cameras or toys that help me be more efficient as like an independent filmmaker as somebody who doesn't need a camera doesn't have a cameraman and that's exactly what this does all right watch this see ya see how it's not recording watch this so just uh get back raise by hand flashes this light at me now it's recorded now I walk around and it follows me wherever I go even I kind of walk behind stuff or if I come over here and I hide for if I get totally close up and then when I'm done it's kind of raise my hand and uh look at stop stop recording it's kind of amazing it's a little tiny one-person camera crew you know a question I get so often by up-and-coming creators and and people that are new to YouTube is what kind of camera should I use and my feedback is always it's not the camera it's how you use it in a tool like this makes a camera your phone or whatever's in your pocket it makes it a hundred times better this plus the phone that you already have is like this is a tiny little 159 dollar camera crew so nice work insta 360. this is now yet another piece of my like filmmaking gear that permanently lives in my backpack and makes my movies better insta360 flow is what it's called it's 159 bucks there's a link below foreign [Music] I don't see procrastination as something that holds me back but it's something I can harness to push me forward see I know I don't have the kind of focus that it takes to like architect a huge project and dedicate three or four years of my life to realizing but I'm capable of something called hyper Focus wherein if there's a project I can realize now I could dedicate everything to it and and tackle it with the kind of efficiency of a Japanese bullet train they call it attention deficit disorder and this is dead wrong it's attention deficit Advantage this is my superpower no I can't focus on my health and exercise 20 minutes a day three days a week but I've run 25 marathons I ran 70 miles last week no I don't have the focus to spend like three years on a single movie but I can make a movie today and then I can make a movie tomorrow I can do that 800 days in a row and call it a daily Vlog that's that's part of that that's that's the superpower so rather than trying to bend my gut brain to accommodate the world around me I just work to bend the world around me to benefit my fantastic brain and as far as oh as far as procrastination this is just this is a small tax a small burden a small hurdle I have to jump over in exchange for this superpower [Music] a lot of the um themes ideas and even like direct quotes in this video around ADHD and add a lot of those were taken from an author named Jesse J Anderson he writes about uh he writes about those things and he doesn't have very like relatable humorous way so if any of this kind of stuck with you or felt familiar to you or any of these ideas uh discussed in the video you should definitely check him out he's got a newsletter he's on Twitter right here um brilliant guy and and thank you Jesse for Lending me your ideas for this video [Music]"

And I could just start to feel like I was getting the goosebumps on my body. I just thought maybe we just had a cold. I just think I should just go home and lie down. Later that day, Brenda checks on Rob. I felt his forehead. He felt warm. And then I grabbed the thermometer and took the temperature. And I was like, oh, my gosh, you have 104 degree temperature. I was starting to get nervous because I'd always heard that high temperatures like that can be really dangerous. I said, Let's cool you down. Let's get you upstairs into the bathtub. He was really weak at that point, so it was hard to kind of pry him away from the couch. And I had to kind of be aggressive and say, Rob, go upstairs. Brenda finally gets Rob into the bathroom. I remember. I was just brutal getting in that water, that's for sure. The bath does help to bring down Rob's temperature. And that night he's able to get some rest. But the following morning his fever is back, along with another new symptom. I started develop like really bad headaches. It felt like my head was put in a vise grip and somebody would just kept turning the vise grip and kept turning the vise grip and kept turning it and just my head was just going to be crushed. It was just. Just a god awful feeling. Given its severity, His wife Brenda, takes him to the doctor. Rob explained the symptoms. The doctor narrowed it down to with this sort of ice pick type of headache. And he said it's it seems like it's a cluster headache. Cluster headaches are a series of relatively short but extremely painful headaches that reoccur every day for weeks or months at a time. I was like, Huh, That's really strange because he's never gotten headaches before. And so the doctor said, Well, why don't you you guys go home, see how he's doing overnight? And then if he still has a fever and isn't feeling well, then let us know tomorrow. But by the next morning, Rob's condition hasn't improved. So Brenda takes him back to the doctor. Rob said the only thing it makes me feel better, Brenda, is if I just have a bag of ice on my head. So we got the bag of ice and he was holding it on his head while we were waiting in the waiting room. I was extremely worried. We've been traveling and I was starting to get worried that it was related to our trip. Eventually a doctor comes to look at Rob and is immediately concerned. He just looked at me and he said, Somebody of your health should not be sitting in my waiting room with a bag of ice on your head. The doctor tells Brenda to take Rob straight to the hospital. Where he's examined by another team of physicians. I said, Well, maybe it is something from when we were traveling. But the doctors pay little attention to Brenda and instead focus on Rob's high fever and stabbing headaches. No one seemed to take it seriously that we had been traveling. The doctor basically said he seems to be really dealing with something more in his head. Suspecting a neurological issue, the doctors order a round of tests to look more closely at Rob's brain. I got MRIs done MRIs, ultrasounds, CAT scans, everything. But the results failed to provide answers. So doctors admit Rob for observation and further testing. And that night, while Rob is sleeping, his condition takes a bizarre turn. I remember thinking that there are people kind of running around the room. It was just like a guy with a spear kind of thing running around. Things were getting worse and getting worse quickly. It was frightening. The next morning when doctors hear about Rob's hallucinations, they have a new theory as to what's wrong with him. They said, oh, well, we think he might have meningitis. Meningitis is the inflammation of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord. It can be caused by a virus or in some cases, a parasite. I was feeling really scared for Rob. The doctors do a spinal tap, but it doesn't provide any answers. And they ruled out meningitis. They still were at a loss as far as what was happening. It was a really frustrating. Over the next few hours as doctors struggle to figure out what's wrong, Brenda notices a sharp turn in Rob's health. Rob's Skin. Looked gray. It looked like the blood was draining out of him. And the doctor said there's an onset of liver failure and kidney failure. I started to get resourceful and call as many people as I could to say, My husband's in the hospital. My husband's. I cry just like my husband is dying. And there's I can't get any help. I've tried to do everything I can. Can you please help me? Through a friend. Brenda is put in touch with a physician who studies infectious diseases. Dr. Charlie Evans. He got a call from Brenda who said that her husband was hospitalized and wasn't getting better and was concerned that he wasn't getting a proper treatment. Dr. Evans explains that it's hard to say what could be wrong with Rob without seeing his medical information and lab results. So Brenda goes over to the nurses station. I asked the nurse, Can I have Rob's medical records? And at that point she said, No, I'm sorry, that's confidential information. And I said, Well, I'm his wife. I'd like to see his records. But the nurse won't hand them over. So Brenda does something drastic. When the nurse walked away, I took the medical record. I started flipping through trying to find pages of information that had what looked like labs on it. Brenda sends the results to Dr. Evans and he pours over the information until he comes across something troubling. He had evidence of pneumonia. I was concerned about that. Dr. Evans goes back to Brenda for more information, including any recent trips her and Rob have taken. Brenda was was a very serious historian about telling me about where they had been. I explained that we had just gotten back from Costa Rica. For Dr. Evans. It's the missing piece of the puzzle. Just knowing where he had been gave me a good suspicion that we were dealing with an unusual disease that we don't see very often in this country. Dr. Evans believes Rob's body is under attack from a deadly intruder. Based on Rob's symptoms I suspected he had. Leptospirosis."

      "corpus": "with the odds stacked against me here I'm leaving Alaska and going down to the Columbia River on the Oregon Washington border here they have a large population of white sturgeon and I'll have a much better chance of catching one this will be another first for me I've never caught a white sturgeon before and I hear they can put up an incredible fight this line although it's very fine is actually uh it actually has a breaking strain of 100 pounds uh it's braided line the thing about this is though it's nice and supple so uh you know that's not going to sort of drag a lot in the water but another thing about it is it's got well it's got no stretch virtually no stretch compared to nylon monofilament normal fishing line and what that means is if I hook a big fish with this I haven't got that elasticity of the line you know I'm gonna feel everything very very directly up here so you know it's going to be quite a physical um struggle with a fish on this gear so just one final detail of what we're using here is a is a barbless hook there's no Barb on there and that's very much about just sort of looking after the fish I'm going to drop this bait into about 80 feet of water so there we go it's fully rigged I think it's still sinking it's going down that 80 foot of water and that will just bump there we just bump the bottom there bring it in there that's fine oh that's a bit of a knock again there a bit of a knotless there's something definitely interesting all right [Music] it's at that point where all you're imaginings about what's under the water they are well they're starting to take shape whatever it is is on the end of that line but that line is so fine the water here is pretty deep 70 foot or so I'm attached to something there it is there it is there it is there it is my first white sturgeon and the animal I think can easily grow to become a lake monster so I just bring it up and then look out while taking the hook out my chance to finally see the Monster up close eludes me that was a very very brief contact with the animal there I was leaning over the side that was I couldn't reach out as far as I wanted the sturgeon are clearly here and that one was about five feet long but I want a larger one white sturgeon can grow to about 20 feet in there it's not long before I get my next bite and this one feels much bigger [Music] and this fish could be bigger than I am when the fish wants to go I'm letting it go but I'm letting it go Under Pressure it's having to work for the line it takes away and then when the fish takes a bit of a breather I'm hoping you know in those little gaps I can gain a wee bit of line I think we might have to might be an idea to cast off Jack I think it might help if we cast off this is a long long run we're running out of line here we're running out of line and this goes quick we're on the backing we're on the back end wait a minute wait a minute [Music] if you have a look at this look at this line This is the backing I think I may have hooked a monster but I'm running out of line that's the end of my line there off the Reel I want to get the proper line back on the reel right there we are we've got the line back on the Reel here that was Harry I was watching my line going that light that Line's coming up on the water that's the fish that's the fish there it is there we go there we go there we go there we go seeing the fish now that is certainly a big fish it's taken me half an hour to bring this sturgeon in knowing that this is only around half the length they can grow to I now totally believe that a larger one could drag a tree stump into the water that was a tiring fight I've caught some big fish and fresh water this is probably this is probably the biggest freshwater fish I've caught uh about 300 pounds this one just you know a real monstrous fish that's actually 105 or even 106 inches that's eight foot ten inches nearly nine foot nearly nine foot this way it's quite a thought that's one and a half times me at nine feet this fish is roughly 80 years old but they can live to over a hundred this looks big in the water but these things grow to 20 foot possibly even more and I mean just imagine seeing that in the water I mean you could be forgiven for saying that was a monster up to 20 feet long matches all the descriptions I've heard about the monster including Robin's plus the pectoral fins on the long streamlined body fit how she described what she saw but what about the teeth marks on the propeller the mouth here no teeth in there at all I can put my put my hands in there see it's almost it's very telescopic you can imagine that just standing and literally just sucking in a small fish having only gums means it couldn't have been teeth marks on the propeller but I think I know what caused them and what's interesting about a sturgeon it hasn't got a bony skeleton the way we have or the way most other fish has it's just got cartilage but what it has got it's got bony plates on the outside of the body not totally covering it but just in rows and these are you know some form of protection they really are you know sort of quite tough bits of bone there we go and also very bony head very bony Gill flap as well I believe Bill triffon's parents actually ran over a white sturgeon and the propeller going over its bony plates caused what looked like teeth marks it may not have any teeth but this mouth is perfectly formed for being a bottom feeder eating mollusks and small fish this would explain why it is so rarely seen on lake iliamna or lake Clark thanks for watching if you enjoyed this video don't forget to like the River Monsters page thank you"

      "corpus": "foreign this is the town of Saint Thomas Nevada or Nevada as they say here around the turn of the century St Thomas was a bustling agricultural Town it was a farming town and people lived here this was actually the school the elementary school where the kids went every day every day kids would run down these stairs to go home and play with their toys or probably do chores it is a farming Community also it's raining here today so hat but by 1940 this entire town was under 60 feet of water because about 10 miles that way is Hoover Dam and this was once Lake Mead now as we all know Lake Mead has retracted quite a bit over the years of going through something of a mega drought right now so sometime in the 1990s St Thomas um was out of the water again and what's left here is mostly just a bunch of Foundations but this was basically about 50 years underwater and the fact of the matter is St Thomas is just one of dozens hundreds even of sunken towns and Villages all around the world that were created because of reservoirs being built sometimes the Levee broke sometimes it was a catastrophe sometimes they got their land butt out from them but they're all over the place and most of them are actually still underwater So today we're going to look at the history and some of the coolest and most interesting sunken towns in the world [Music] there's a great quote from the movie Inherit the Wind where the character Henry Drummond says quote progress has never been a bargain you have to pay for it progress isn't free it's from Team America that whole thing yeah for most of us progress is this inevitable unyielding force that moves a Breakneck speed and you're just trying to keep up with it basically I mean just look at all the AI news lately we also generally believe that progress is a good thing and on the whole it is I mean we like to complain about the modern world a lot but if you think about it we live lives of luxury that the richest kings 500 years ago couldn't have even imagined but all that progress has externalities and unintended consequences like take the interstate highway system here in the U.S yes it may cross country travel a lot easier and faster and it was actually funded as a National Defense measure in the 1950s but it also killed a lot of small towns you know small towns that you used to have to drive through on small you know Farm to Market roads and whatnot maybe stop and get a sandwich or patronize a business and now you just bypass completely I kind of grew up in one of those towns but a lot of small towns had it way worse earlier in the 20th century there was a kind of a massive leap in progress that led to a lot of towns going underwater and I don't mean that financially I mean literally underwater North America is covered with artificial Lakes those Lake bottoms used to be ground ground that had a long history maybe people used to travel there maybe people Farm there maybe people lived there maybe a lot of people live there it's a really weird thought when you realize that for a lot of lakes there are Towns at the bottom of them think about that the next time you're on a jazz game so how did this happen well in the early 20th century there was a mass migration of people from rural to urban areas as industrialization led to new jobs and higher wages in the cities between 1800 and 1920 the percentage of the population that lived in cities went from 30 to 50 percent all those new people needed clean water and all those factories needed power so what follow was an explosion of new artificial lakes and reservoirs and hydropower stations all over the country for example here in Dallas the population doubled from 1910 to 1920s so the city bought land around White Rock Creek to build a reservoir the dam was finished in 1914 and it began to fill up with water creating what is today White Rock Lake although this used to be Farmland today is the largest urban park in the country it's twice the size of Central Park no Towns at the bottom of it though the same can't be said for many lakes in Tennessee starting in the 1930s the Tennessee Valley Authority was created to build dams and power stations along the Tennessee River and while yes it provided power and improved the economy and modernize the entire region it also displaced 125 000 people and destroyed several towns it also saved George Clooney at the end of O Brother Where Art Thou another standout area was New York state where the Catskill Aqueduct was built between 1917 and 1924. it created six reservoirs to provide water for New York City but this required drowning 25 communities if that sounds Bittersweet that's ironic because one of the towns was actually called bittersweet even more ironic one of the towns was called Neversink now to be clear these communities weren't just drowned with no warning or recompense they were acquired by imminent domain and people were paid for their land but still sometimes towns are lost to progress it happens a lot and sometimes nature decides it needs to slap a bit that's exactly what happened to Port Royal Jamaica Port Royal has a crazy history actually it was an important hub for transatlantic trade everything from sugarcane to Rum textiles cotton and of course Slaves by the late 1600s it was one of the largest European cities in the new world second only to Boston but it was also riddled with pirates yeah like the whole Pirates of the Caribbean thing this is where all those pirates hung out and with them came all the booze and prostitutes and debauchery one would expect it was once called quote the most wicked and sinful city in the world a title that now belongs to of course Provo Utah it was so associated with pirates that the famous pirate Captain Henry Morgan became the city's lieutenant governor in 1675. yeah that Captain Morgan but the party was short-lived because on the morning of June 7 1692 a massive 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the island Port Royal was largely built over sand which experienced instant liquefaction buildings roads and people were literally swallowed up by the ground geysers erupted structures collapsed and then a tsunami hit the city that basically watched anything that hadn't already been destroyed out to sea by the time it ended around 33 Acres of the city had just disappeared underwater four of the five forts were demolished and 2 000 people were killed one detail that I ran across it's a pretty gruesome is that apparently all that liquefaction in the ground caused the bodies in the cemetery to come to the surface and then the tsunami washed those out to sea to mingle with all the newly dead Port Royal still exists today but most of the original cities Under 12 meters of water one of the more interesting sunken towns is the ancient city of shachin and China means lion City in Chinese because the city is populated by dozens of lion statues and this place is old it was founded in 621 A.D during the Tang Dynasty and actually became kind of a major administrative Hub in the XI Jin Province but in 1959 as China began modernizing their infrastructure hydroelectric dam was built creating the chandau lake chandel lake grew to cover 573 square kilometers leaving many of the hilltops above water and which actually created thousands of islands it's actually a pretty neat landscape but in the process it displaced more than 300 000 people and flooded several towns and communities much like the Tennessee Valley Authority but way bigger which begs the question is there a Chinese remake of O Brother Where Art Thou because I want to say that cheen was a prominent in ancient city and now it's gone and that's sad but there is a silver lining because it was flooded before the area industrialized so it actually kind of is Frozen in time it's it's preserved in water much the way it was a thousand years ago you just need scuba gear to see it in fact some have taken to calling at the Chinese Atlantis in that same general hemisphere of the world as calyazen Russia this is another town that was drowned by a man-made lake with a slight difference that we'll get to here in a second kanyazim was settled on the high Bank of the Volga River and was separated into by another small river called the jobna the town's population grew over the years eventually sporting a couple of churches the monastery of Saint Nicholas or the Nicholson Cathedral on One bank and The Trinity College and Monastery on the other bank but in the 1920s say it with me several Hydro power plants were built one of which created the ugly Reservoir which drowned half the town and just like that all those houses and Gardens and streets storefronts all that stuff went to a watery grave except for one thing the bell tower of the nikolski cathedral it was just tall enough so that half of the bell tower remained above water creating a really interesting View later on this Tower would be used as a navigation point in a lighthouse and I think I read that they still do Services there sometimes makes the baptisms pretty easy I guess by the way it's not the only submerged tower in the world there's a whole page on Atlas obscura of submerged towers around the world including in Italy Spain and Venezuela but perhaps the oldest underwater city is pelva Petri Greece now you might be thinking you know hold on a second that Chinese city was built in 620 A.D surely this isn't older than that well it is older than that and don't call me Shirley Pavlo Petri was completely lost at time until it was discovered on a peloponnese peninsula in 1967 and it was mapped the following year and it's believed to have been inhabited as far back as 3000 BCE it's like 5 000 years ago this was a Bronze Age City and some researchers consider it Neolithic An Origin based on some of the items that they found there nobody knows for sure what happened to this city to make it slip into the drink but theories include earthquakes rising sea levels erosion and a tsunami and of course the Tennessee Valley Authority really using digital technology archaeologists discovered buildings Courtyards streets tombs and religious structures many of which suggest they were Mycenaean society as Elias spondylus the head of Greece's underwater Antiquities Department said quote it is significant because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied as such it represents a frozen moment of the past so yeah kind of like xiachen the fact that this town was submerged actually preserved it and offers a unique glimpse into the past at this once important city or maybe it was a Port Royal of its day who knows by the way this city um predates Plato's story about Atlantis just saying now this is by no means an exhaustive list there are hundreds of sunken towns and communities around the world and yeah as bigger and bigger dams start to be constructed more and more towns will continue to disappear I mean the three gorgeous Dam in China drowned 13 cities 140 towns 1300 Villages and displaced up to 1.3 million people but it also generates around 100 terawatts per year without using a fossil fuels so its merits are hotly debated the point is as we continue to decarbonize our electrical grids into the future we might be seeing more of these dams being built sacrificing even more towns and Villages plus as more people move into the cities those cities will need more water spurring more reservoirs that drown more towns and then those people will move into the cities which will need more water it's a vicious cycle add-on type of that rising sea levels and more extreme weather events due to climate change and we might be entering a new golden age of sunken towns different golden age is the right word no that's very vague and unspecific but there is one very specific weather event that researchers are keeping an eye on one that might spell Doom for a lot of towns in California okay so take a look at this picture this is K Street in Sacramento in early 1862. that year California was hit with a massive flood that came to be known as the great flood of 1862. it started as a snowstorm in the Sierras that turned into the biggest flood in modern U.S history California saw one third of all property destroyed 800 000 cattle drown and four thousand people died towns in the Sierras were the first hit as the rivers overflowed their Banks and as the flood traveled into the valley several towns disappeared overnight with entire communities drowned almost instantly after several weeks of rain Sacramento to the San Joaquin Valley were completely underwater that's 483 kilometers by 32 kilometers wide flooded up to nine meters deep all this water affected places as far away as Arizona Nevada Oregon New Mexico even Utah and Idaho all places there right now are dealing with a mega drought turns out they also get mega floods and fairly often according to the U.S Geological Survey Mega floods hit California about once every 200 years on average and the last one was in 1862. who's doing the math sedimentary analysis suggests that this pattern is repeated for at least 2 000 years and these are corroborated by Native American legends in the area of course this didn't happen every 200 years some periods were longer than others so maybe the real takeaway here is that it could happen anytime maybe I shouldn't smile when I say that so as we were writing this episode California's been dealing with massive flooding and insane snowstorms that have affected up to 15 million people and actually caused a handful of deaths it's being blamed on atmospheric Rivers which is an awesome term and this is exactly what it sounds like a massive flow of moisture in the atmosphere that condenses and Falls as rain as this graphic shows the Earth has a kind of belt of warm equatorial air masses that are saturated with water vapor from the war motion below this belt is always traveling toward the east from our perspective thanks to the Earth's rotation this is called the Coriolis effect but from time to time this swirling mass of air can fling a little piece of itself off to the North or South creating these long tendril structures filled with water that's the atmospheric River and when it hits the land and cools it condenses and falls to the ground as floods the ones that hit California tend to break off and come from the direction of Hawaii so they're actually called a Pineapple Express that sounds like a joke but it's not that's what they call it but from time to time all this chaos will line up just right and filling a particularly massive chunk of itself toward California and that's how you get these Mega floods but the biggest of these Mega floods was in 1605. historical evidence suggests that the 1605 flood was at least 50 bigger than any of the other Mega floods including the 1862 one it's thought that this flood basically just made a lake out of the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys that lasted more than a decade this is the Doomsday scenario that keeps climate scientists up at night it's not a massive earthquake that could knock California into the sea it's this this is a storm that has actually happened before and variations of it have happened regularly for at least 2000 years it is almost certain that this is going to happen again in the U.S Geological Survey already has a name for this storm they call it arcstorm AR stands for atmospheric River and the K stands for 1000 because the storm could bring one in one thousand year floods to some places it's believed that this future flood could cause up to one trillion dollars in damage with a death toll in the tens of thousands the scenario includes overwhelming flight in the Central Valley Orange County Los Angeles County San Diego the San Francisco Bay area and other Coastal communities wind speeds in some places could reach up to 201 kilometers per hour and hundreds of landslides could damage roads highways and homes major Metro areas like Los Angeles Sacramento and San Diego could find themselves partly or completely underwater it's not total Doom and Gloom though there are some things we can do to prepare for it a recent study published in science advances in 2022 talked about some of the options it's Daniel Swann one of the researchers involved in this study told CNN quote I think the extent of Mega flood losses can be significantly reduced by doing certain sorts of things to revamp our flood management and our water management systems and our disaster preparedness that same study also pointed out that yes I know we're all tired of hearing about this but yes climate change does play a part in this warmer temperatures means warmer Waters means more water vapor in the equatorial belt which creates larger atmospheric Rivers by the way this doesn't just happen in California these atmospheric Rivers occur all around the world so yeah between the needs of Modern Life and the effects of Modern Life we may be losing a lot of towns and communities in the coming years which is sad but going back to St Thomas the town that I visited at the beginning of this video apparently the last person to leave the town was a guy named Hugh Lord who literally waited until his home was halfway underwater before putting all of his stuff in a canoe and Rowing away from its house in every one of these towns have a story like that I'm sure people people don't want to leave their homes people don't want to have to change so maybe the lesson in all this is that we're going to have to be more flexible in the future be more willing to adapt that's what got us this far one thing you can easily change is your shaving habits like getting rid of those plastic cartridge blades for a Precision safety razor from Hinson shaving okay look at this you see what they did here look at this they performed an experiment just to prove that their razors are better on the skin than the cartridge ones so you've heard me talk about Henson they're cheaper they're cooler they're more sustainable yada yada that's all great but the best part is they're nerds their design was based on the idea that if you fully supported blade all the way across you could cut down on chatter which is the blade skipping across the surface of the skin and because they work with Aerospace grade equipment they can make the design incredibly precise so they did and they've been getting rave reviews for it but that was not enough they teamed up with a company called Mimosa Diagnostics to use their special thermal camera to measure the differences in blood flow to the skin after using their razor and a leading cartridge Blade the more damage is caused to the skin the more blood flow that same damage leads to razor burn which the medical term is erythema and they did this with multiple people and you can see how it's redder on some people's faces than others it's redder with the cartridge razors then with the hens and razors and they determined that quote statistically significant Improvement in post-shave arrhythmia was observed when using the Henson razor and you can see it right there in those photos it's crazy I mean just the fact that these guys went to this much effort to check their own Works enough reason to give them a shot this is really cool so um it's better it saves you money over time it's less plastic and it's even better for your face so head over to hansonshaving.com and give one a try grab a box of 100 blades while you're at it and enter the code Joe Scott at checkout and you'll get those blades for free you literally won't spend another dime on shaving for like a year at least it helps support this channel helps support an awesome company and you'll get a better shave I mean what more do you need uh hensonshaving.com links down below all right today's the day everybody this is the big reveal of the champion of the

But then, it's not just with workouts I shouldn't keep regarding it as a workout But the time for self-management, not just workouts, should be guaranteed Not just workouts... But there's the nature of our job...

Ah, that's right \"What are you doing today?\" \"I'll be doing this and that today\" That's the conversation between average people But when people, who work out, are asked, \"What are you doing today?\" We say, \"Well, I guess my back?\" And, \"What did you do today? Chest? Okay, let's do back workouts together\" Do you do split workouts? - I do 3-day split workouts - Yes, I also do 3-day split workouts 3-day split workouts? Where? Where? - I do the chest and shoulders together - Chest and shoulders together I don't do many shoulder workouts these days And I do my back and arms Arms separately Oh, the arms separately? Then, you don't have lower-body workouts I'm avoiding lower-body workouts Because once I start, I have a feeling it'll drive me away from dancing Oh, that's right - Due to the nature of my profession - Oh, due to the nature of your profession Actually, it's best to start lower body workouts at a young age But you'll feel it when the time comes There's a moment when you feel the necessity to do it I always say this, but it's only right to start with workouts that you enjoy That's how you grow interested and find joy The same goes for your body It's not a bad thing to work out more on parts that you like Great, then let's do quick back and shoulder workouts in the style of partner workouts Because the two of you go on tour a lot, and you're members So, let's try doing workouts that are best for when you're abroad Our Natural Champion (90-degree bow out of adGYMiration) Let's warm-up Oh, but you've got good shoulders as a given And you also look good without your jacket Oh, this guy has a nice body DINO, is that your real name? - No, it's my stage name - It's your stage name, right?

Wow, I honestly learned a lot And when this clip is released, I want to teach our members accordingly Ah, that sounds great Once you work out like this, you feel, \"Oh, did I not work out enough?\" when you guys workout with each other So your personal standards are raised I was so happy, and next time I want to try my lower body I'll return The heart was so shameful, but... - No one asked you to do it - That's true He's a guy full of love Hurry and have something good to eat and rest - Yes - Get going - Thank you for your hard work - Hurry and get going Give us your autographs on your way out Wow, seriously These madmen You'll be falling into the madmen category soon, seeing the protein...

this place called rain tailors usually bespoke suits are like in the thousands at least because everything's custom and made to measure I love a great deal and I was not disappointed the staff was so friendly I was very intimidated at first but they guided me through the whole process I got to pick the Fabrics the buttons the colors the Cuffs the lining and you can even add extras like extra Pockets but I chose to engrave my name into my suit jacket so everything's customizable and they measure your body so it's made perfectly to fit you you also get a free custom shirt but I decided to upgrade the material to a silk material look how beautiful this is I don't wear clothes often let alone suits but it was just such a good deal that I had to get two different suits I also got an overcoat and some shirts done but yeah a bespoke suit with a shirt with a tie starting at 220 US dollars is a steal here's the address if you guys are interested I just picked up our suits and now I need to get dinner so far I'm pretty impressed with the selection that 7-Eleven has in terms of healthy food and food that I can actually eat they have eggs that's an option beef jerky no it's not beef jerky can't eat instant noodles they have nuts maybe go for some nuts they have this pigeon brand I actually checked the macros not bad sauces I think I need to get some tuna these squid snacks aren't bad actually but they just have a ton of sodium it's almost suggested I should get these Sun bites because they're made from quinoa and they're supposedly healthy but the macros aren't that good in terms of protein so it goes off on these Sun Chips not gonna get cereal because it's a fake healthy food guys this might be a lifesaver they have Frozen white fish and just frozen meats I think this is the leanest thing I've seen all day but I don't think I need all this all right Kings I've decided what I'm gonna make for dinner got my ingredients and we're gonna head home to make the meal but I can't wait to get home from our bank tomorrow lunch guys I think that couple I think he's having some fun this is meal number three it's a fishbowl soup with a soy sauce egg and some tuna let's give this a taste test those noodles are made of fish and it's good broth is nice do you guys like eating tuna out of the can I do Kings I have bad news I just did the math and that was 44 grams of protein and meal number three so I think we're at 97 grams of protein for the whole day over three meals and I tried my best to always add protein into my meals but Kings I just don't think it's possible unless I eat like six meals a day at 7-Eleven to get 200 grams of protein I think if you're in a Russian you need a quick snack then 7-Eleven is great but Lester just go to 7-Eleven to get eggs chicken breast and tuna then you can hit your Macros but most of the things there don't have great macros unlike this I'm gonna finally open this box and hopefully it has what I need to save me oh my God yes I've been waiting so long for these I'm so happy I've literally dreamed of these because they got stuck in customs and now I finally have it oh and some other goodies but this is what I'm the most excited for kids I tried my best birthday cake flavor chocolate peanut butter double chocolate oh my goodness this will get me to my protein goals birthday cake flavor is my favorite oh my goodness I can't wait [Music] hmm double chocolate guys can you tell I've been waiting so long that eat these seagull bars [Music] and screw it why not I'm also gonna have a peanut butter chocolate [Music] I've been waiting so long for this Kings this is literally the tastiest there's just something in my teeth I'm sorry I failed but this is such an amazing way to fail um each of these has 20 grams of protein 220 calories only so filling and it has 15 grams of fiber in this one little chewy tasty bar is tastes literally like a soft chocolatey Snickers candy bar and they're literally the best protein bar I've ever had and I've had a lot of my time and if you guys want to try them out use code King Link in description they're called Seco bars and you can also use my code for pre-pump protein powders like comment subscribe thank you King so much for watching and until next time we're getting Shredder together but um first I'm gonna eat this um"

      "corpus": "[wind blowing] PETER: Good morning, from Phoenix. If there's one thing I've learned by making videos in the United States it's that you can't put an easy label on this place. So many different types of people living in so many different types of ways. So today we're gonna go two hours west from Phoenix out into the desert to get into a community that's living from what I'm told, somewhat off the grid. In RVs, in trucks, in cars. Some by choice, fleeing that very cold weather up North. Others by necessity. So let's get out there, talk to these people, and see what we can learn about this lifestyle. Let's do this. [mellow country music] [truck driving on gravel] PETER: So guys, this is one of those videos where I just sort of wing it. Lot of videos have someone planned up to meet up with a story but this one is... Let's find it. PETER: So how long you been doing this for? RANDY: About five years now. We sold our house in Atlanta. That was gonna be our forever house. We remodeled it, we spent a lot of... Heated floors, waterfall in the back yard into a pond with koi fish, you know? And then one day we're out in Yellowstone in the park. We had rented an RV. We're driving one morning, the sun's coming up, we're looking at each other like, \"We could do this.\" [Peter chuckles] -So we did. We enjoy it. You meet so many good people. -Is this your buddy right here? -Yeah, this is Ram. He's been doing this for, like, 17 years. PETER: Oh, wow. All right, guys, that didn't take too much work to be honest. PETER: How you doing, sir? RAM: Pretty good, you? -Good. -My name's Ram. -Ram, Peter. -It's a pleasure to meet ya. -Nice to meet you. PETER: So you're saying I go down here... RANDY: The street right here... PETER: Okay. RANDY: Go down to the stop sign and in front of you is gonna be wide open nothing. There's like 14,000 acres of Bureau of Land Management land. And you go pick your spot. -Anyone can camp out there? -Anyone can camp out here. -Can you stay as long as you want? RAM: They have two week, move two week... Whatever, but then they have like us. We pay $180 for, like, six months. RANDY: For six months. RAM: And they have water station, and a place to dump your tanks, and your trash, and all that. PETER: So this is a good zone? RANDY: We think so. You really want to see the crowd, go down to South. RAM: Oh, yeah. PETER: How many miles is that? -From here, once you hit the main road, maybe four miles. PETER: How many people do you think are living out there in the desert? -Right now probably at least... At least a quarter million. -[Peter surprised] Quarter million? RAM: During the RV show last year... PETER: Wait, wait... RAM: 1.3 million people were here. RAM: Last year... RANDY: You missed it by a week. RAM: You just missed the RV show. PETER: All right, let me get that straight. Just out here, quarter million people in the desert? -You've got about 14,000 acres out here of Bureau of Land Management. There's about a quarter million people out there right now. -Well, if this is empty, I can't imagine what it was. Look at this, guys, for as far as the eye can see here... RVs. Both sides of the road. [Truck banging over speed bump] PETER: So Craig, what's the story with this truck? It's a Harley-Davidson edition? CRAIG: Yeah, it's a 2011 Cummings ISX 13-speed auto PETER: Look at the design on this. Who comes out here? All different types or is it like... -Everybody from somebody camping out of their car to the $2 million Class A. We see everything. [gravel crunching] MAN: I'm a retired, after 28 years, law enforcement. I did... My last 20 years was as a federal game warden on the East Coast. And I had to retire because of medical reasons. I decided I'm not gonna sit on my a**, and live the rest of my life watching Netflix on the couch. I wanted to be outside like I have been for 20 years. PETER: Gotcha. -Doing my job, so I decided... I watched videos and saw people doing this. I'm like, \"I wanna come out here and do this.\" And I love it. [four wheeler revving] PETER: How's the vibe out here? You guys get along pretty well? BOB: Oh yeah, we get along great. ROBERT: Oh, yeah. PETER: When you see the Confederate flag that doesn't bum you out or anything? -Why? -Okay, tell me. Tell me. [Bob laughing] ROBERT: Why? Why should it bother me? PETER: All right. ROBERT: It's a freakin' flag. It's the North Virginia battle flag is what it was. PETER: Yeah, I don't get into politics but it's just you have all different types, all different flags, and everything seems to sort of jive from what I see. -Yep. -I was with the naked circle. Is that what it's called? BOB: Oh, you went up to... ROBERT: You went to the magic circle. PETER: Oh, it's a magic circle? [all laughing] PETER: There are a lot of old men with their junk hanging? ROBERT: I tell you what, my coworker in here, he's 85 years old, and that's where he lives at. BOB: There's a lot of big RVs back over here. Way back over here. PETER: There's an ambulance over there. BOB: Yeah, that's my ambulance. PETER: That's your ambu... You're living in an ambulance? -Yeah. -You feel safe in there? -It is very safe actually. It's very secure. You're not gonna get in there once everything's locked up. BOB: Some people just can't take it. It's just too... You know, you can't be negative, because negativity just destroys everything. -Okay. -Um, you just gotta cope. It's always something that you gotta deal with. Somethings wrong... This guy back here... His transmission broke, and he cant' fix it here. So he had to go down the road and fix it. -Okay. -And it's always something. That's kind of a phrase that everybody has, \"Well, it's always something.\" You know, \"This broke, that broke.\" -How long you been out here? -I've been traveling around the country since 2014 and for... This is my third year. Where I just got rid of everything I own. -Do you know who lives here? -Yeah, Kelly and Riz. -And they're living full-time there? -Oh, yeah. PETER: So this is your ambulance? BOB: This is the ambulance. I wish I'dda washed it. I was gonna wash it yesterday. I didn't wash it. If I'd known you were coming I woulda washed it. -It's looking good. -A lot of these guys go and they convert their ambulance into an RV. -Okay. -I refuse to do that. Because I'm an ambulance purist. -You have a podcast? -I do. -Oh yeah, there we go. Bob, what's your theme? -Just living out here and traveling. Stuff like that. -All right, so go ahead and check out Bob's podcast if you want more intimate detail. -There ya go. Sometimes very intimate. So basically... -Out at the magic circle it gets very... -It's still an ambulance. -Okay. -Unfortunately my welcome mat is that but yeah. It's just still an ambulance. You don't have to do anything. Plenty of storage. -Right. Built in already. -Built in already. -You have, [knocks] insulation? -Yeah. [knocks] -Yeah. No, it's very well insulated. It'll get cold but we have heat for that. -And, you know... All these systems that people put in these vehicles are highly overrated. -Okay, so what's your theory on that? Just keep it simple? -Keep it simple. Here's my cow skin blanket. [taps bench] -Where you sleeping? On the ground? -Yeah, I roll all this stuff out on the ground. -This is the office? -This is the office. -We produce everything here. -Who's we? -Me. -You're calling you, we? -Yeah, the royal we. -Okay. -And this is the electronics area. -Or is it \"We\" means you and the ambulance? -Maybe it does. Maybe there's someone else in there that I'm unaware of. -You come as a unit. -So hard to tell. This is it, you know, I mean we got a little pantry right here. -Okay. -Almost all the cooking is on a campfire. -Can I, uh... [cabinet clicks and opens] There's the pantry. -Refrigerator? -Don't have a refrigerator. -Okay. -Eventually I'll get one but I haven't got one right now. My plan is to get solar and then I'll be able to get a 12 volt refrigerator. But basically all the cooking we do is all on a campfire. [metal banging] PETER: Oh, sorry. That's the podium for the sermons? You have sermons out here? -This is the podium for the podcasts. This is where we... \"And now, ladies and gentlemen...\" PETER: Today's video is sponsored by Bespoke Post. Bespoke Post is a monthly membership club delivering a Box of Awesome.

Now back to the story. -So what do you get out of this lifestyle? Break it down for those that have no clue. -Freedom, freedom, freedom. It just boils down to that, freedom. I don't pay rent. I do what I want when I want. I can get up at noon or I can get up at 6:00. You know, I have a little business. So I do my thing and I'm here because of the high price of diesel. I just refuse to pay the high price of diesel. So a bunch of us, Mike, over there in that school bus. -Mike's in the bus? -He and I both are just furious about diesel prices. So we're just hanging out refusing to pay diesel. -So when diesel comes down are you gonna get on the road? -Yeah... No, I'm crazy. The first year I traveled full-time I went back and forth across the country up and down. Ran the whole border, went up and down across the country, coast to coast twice. It was crazy. I must have done 25,000 miles then. PETER: Wow, look at him. BOB: We would like to be able to... All of us would like to be able to travel a little more than we are right now. We're just kind of hanging out because of... But the price of fuel is coming down, so... It's happening very slowly. ROBERT: That needs to happen faster. PETER: Do you listen to his podcast? ROBERT: No. [all laughing] BOB: And it's a good thing. ROBERT: I don't because we would probably end up in arguments all the time. -Because you're listening to him over there every day? BOB: Or around the camp fire. ROBERT: We have... I won't say opposing. We have different political views. PETER: That makes it fun, spicy. ROBERT: We argue. BOB: We argue. -[Craig laughing] We were arguing last night around the camp fire. -I said, \"Get out of the truck and fight.\" And he said, \"I will shoot you. [all laughing] ROBERT: I don't fight fair. PETER: He's a cop. An ex-cop, you really want to go there? He's got skills. BOB: I was kidding. PETER: So summertime, you guys are getting out of here, right? -We'll be here 'til... Ian and Mike were here 'til June last year. BOB: Not here but we were down at... PETER: You just sweat it out? -It's great, I love the heat. -You go to the magic circle at that time? -No, I do not. [Peter chuckling] PETER: So super social out here? -It can be or it can be not social. It just... You don't... You know... You don't approach people unless they approach you. If you start talking and then whatever... Over time you get to know people. -Okay. -And then they invite you over or you invite them over and then, you know, there's some rules. If you can, you bring your own plate, and your own chair, and your own fork. Most people are very giving. So they're giving their food. If you want to bring food, that's fine. Sometimes I go over to his thing. I'll take a steak over there and cook it on his fire while I'm sitting there or whatever but it's social, and the thing is camping with guys, you know, it's social, and then if I don't talk to him for three days he doesn't care, and vice-versa. So it's a little easier camping with guys than it is when you camp with women, it's very social. -Yeah, what is the singles scene like out here? ROBERT: What singles scene? BOB: Well these are not... These are older women, generally speaking but\u2026 It's nonexistent. ROBERT: And the younger women tend to be van-lifers and that. -Not just that but younger women are like... ROBERT: They are all into... Um... [Bob laughs heartily] -They're all into either each other... [Bob laughing] -I'm not saying I disagree with that, you know? I like to watch but, um... Or they... They... Social justice runs strong out here. It does. It does. PETER: I saw Trump flags everywhere. -There's that too. -Those are the anti-social justice. PETER: Okay, so you get both camps out here. -Those are older people and they tend to be older Caucasian husband and wife teams. Is what that tends to be. Um... With your van-lifers and some of your schooly people, it's the other side of the spectrum. It's the old hippie... BOB: Young hippies. And they're actually pretty cool. PETER: Which are? The young hippies are cool? -I think they're real... I think they're... I would love to be... If I was that age I would love to be doing what they're doing, and what they do is part of their realm. Which is there's a lot of patchouli and, you know... PETER: So it's just old school hippies? BOB: Yeah, basically. -What's different about the hippies now versus the hippies before? BOB: I don't know. ROBERT: They don't care about the environment. PETER: Now? ROBERT: Now. BOB: You don't think they care about the environment? -I don't think they care, you saw what happened over there in Dome Rock? They were frickin' cutting down and burning trees. BOB: For firewood, and then they didn't like my friend 'cause she's a Christian, so... They got into it. They had to leave. PETER: They don't like Christians out here? -That was my take on the whole thing. And they... No, most people... There's a church over there. There's an open-air church over there and most people, it's like whatever, you know? We're not making judgments about religion. It's just this particular group. And I wasn't there, so it's hearsay from my perspective but they were making a lot of noise and the girls got upset that they were making a lot of noise, they went over there and tried to get them to turn it down. They wouldn't. -[man speaking from a distance] ...you were yelling at. -He's got fresh clothes, his hair is combed. BOB: He's all ready to go. PETER: Oh. [all laughing] BOB: We're making a video. This is Mike. PETER: Yeah, they were really talking you up. How you doing, Mike? Peter MIKE: Nice to meet you. PETER: So what's going on out here? You're sort of the OG in this space? -Little bit. -How many years? -17. -Wow. So you did it before it was trending or cool? -Just got sick of the city. I didn't like the high cost of housing. -Okay. -I was just sick of it, man. -What city? -Grand Rapids, Michigan. -Oh, that's not even a big city is it? -No, not comparatively but for the Midwest it's still quite a good size city. When Detroit died, all the sh*t that left Detroit came to Grand Rapids. Came straight to us. Housing went up, jobs disappeared, and I was like, Why am I gonna keep paying for an apartment when I can buy an apartment? -Right. -And pretty much build what I want to inside of it. -I know this is a big ask but can we check it out? ROBERT: It's a hot mess in there isn't it? MIKE: No, it's actually not. Let me get the dogs out together. BOB: If that dog... If you go in there with that dog, you will not come out. ROBERT: Oh, stop it. [all laughing] MIKE: Let me get the dogs harnessed and out. -When I met him last year I was in a bit of a bind. I had issues with my vehicle and then I had issues with my solar, so... He helped me out with both of them and... ...he's the one that got me, like, you know, this is... Do what you can to help people out here. Because you never know when you're gonna need help. -I was told that with the first guy I met in town. He said that's the vibe out here. -Yeah. BOB: If you need help, you'll get help. People help you. I mean there's rules, you can't do certain... You can't work on your trucks out here. That's what the guy with the trailer up front, his problem was. You know, but people will try to do what they can for you. PETER: Slab City, have you guys ever heard of this place? ROBERT: Oh, yeah. -That's a totally different vibe, right? BOB: I think Slab City is, you know... You hear a lot about Slab City in\u2026 with younger people. It's like, \"Oh, did you go to Slab City?\" I went there. I camped out there last year. Nothing bad happened. It's just a... I'll give you my take on it is so there's a hot springs there. Which is great. You go in the hot springs but it's a mess. I mean it's all slimy, and the wood is all old, and you can fall into the water, and there's garbage everywhere. They have a spot over there where they just throw the garbage. -Yeah, yeah, it was pretty trashy when I went. -The flies are terrible and it's like you would think that somebody would say, \"Hey, let's get 20 guys together and clean this up...\" \"...and fix the stuff by the hot springs.\" They won't even do that. So I'm not very impressed with... It's the typical smarter than... You know, what is it? Too smart by half or whatever it is of the Libertarian, Anarchic... \"Oh, you know, we don't need a government. We don't do anything.\" I don't know if I could live there. ROBERT: He's probably long gone by now but you've got Bob Wells, of the movie, Nomad, fame. BOB: Don't promote Bob Wells. [Mike laughing] ROBERT: Of the movie Nomad, fame. I think the one that looks like Santa Clause. He will tell everybody, \"Oh, you can live out here for $600 to $800.\" BOB: In a car. ROBERT: In a car. And he convinces senior citizens to do that... ...and I don't agree with it. BOB: Mostly women. ROBERT: Because it can get very difficult out here and if you're an older person that isn't a little savvy, then it'll kill you. MIKE: It'll kill ya. BOB: So many women, older women, listen, watch this guy, and they will come out here in cars and they're... It's not for the faint of heart. It's just... you are constantly lifting, moving, grabbing, pulling, and if you want to eat you gotta start a fire or you gotta have some kind of propane, something. It's not like being at home and washing dishes at the kitchen sink. -Yeah. -You know, and it can be demanding. And so it's pretty contentious. You go out and talk to those people in the ambulances... Pam, we call her \"Pam of the Pambulance.\" She'll tell you for sure she doesn't like him sending people out here that don't have any real means to protect themselves. ROBERT: Right. -So you're saying there's a whole group of ambulance campers? -It's starting to be which I hate these trends. MIKE: It's becoming a trend. BOB: It's becoming a trend so I'm gonna have to get a bus. [all laughing] PETER: Wait, I thought busses were a trend. ROBERT: That's already a trend. BOB: I know but at least everyone has one. MIKE: This is very much military-style. PETER: Military-style, okay. MIKE: It's very Spartan. PETER: An old Army bus, yeah? MIKE: Um, I don't know what service it is. I'm a vet. -Oh you are a vet? -I'm a vet. -Do you miss the service at all or no? -I do. I do, it's... You wake up in the morning, you don't have to think about what you're gonna do for the day. You don't have to worry about not having somebody around to help if you need help. Stuff like that. -Right. -Out here you're completely on your own unless you got a good group of guys around like these guys here. -You've got that then? -Yeah. -And you love Hot Wheels? -I do. It's just a hobby. Something my dad used to get me when he would go on trips, or vacations, or out for a weekend. He would bring me back one and I just continued the hobby. [chuckles] -Okay, that's cool. PETER: Wow, it reminds me... I haven't been in a bus since I was a kid. [Mike laughs] -It\u2019s kinda short. You know, I'm a short guy. So I got the clearance but if you're a taller guy it can be a little bit of a challenge. She's a beast, she's solid. About five and a half miles to the gallon in the city, about seven and a half to nine miles on the highway. -Okay. What did you pay for it? If you don't mind me asking. -Six grand. -Six grand... 17 years ago? -No. Last year. -You upgraded? -Yeah. I had a Class C that I was in that was 30 years old and water pump failed, everything in the back broke all at the same time when I went to have it assessed. So like, that's five grand. I was like, \"Oh, sh*t.\" For that price I'm going to find something else. This was my dad who just passed in March. -Oh, I'm sorry. -So he was the one who helped me get approved on the bus. It was the last thing he'd approved for me to work on. -What do you mean he approved for you to work on the bus? -My cash limit to buy the bus. -Your what? -My cash limit to buy the bus. -Oh, okay, okay. -He backed me on that and that was his last thing he did. Like a month before he passed. -I'm sorry. -You did good job. Good girl. PETER: What is this here? What's going on here, Mike? -Somebody made this last year apparently or 2020. -Okay. -I just happened to find it and it made a good reference point for if I come back in the dark. I have a line-up site that I can come in and pull in on. -Okay. PETER: So what are people missing from the outside? ROBERT: What are they missing? PETER: What do they not get? ROBERT: They think we're homeless. BOB: They think we're insane. MIKE: Drug addled, reprobates. BOB: All our families think it's dangerous. BOB: My sister, I sent her a picture of the desert. Beautiful picture of the desert, she goes, \"Looks dangerous.\" And I'm like, \"What's dangerous? It's the desert.\" PETER: Saguaro cacti? Pretty dangerous? BOB: Yeah, they're very dangerous. PETER: If you fall into them. ROBERT: Yeah, if you fall into them. BOB: Yeah, they think it's dangerous. It's not dangerous. MIKE: This is my idea of true freedom. I mean you get to do what you want when you want. You set your own rules and as long as you got a little bit of common sense you'll be all right. PETER: What's the drug scene out here? BOB: I don't know. I don't do drugs. MIKE: Out here, mostly there's meth cookers out here. PETER: Ah. MIKE: There's not really any jobs in town, man. So... -Okay. They peddle to the tourists. -Tourists are into meth? Some of them that are. -The locals will cook the meth, the tourists will buy it. BOB: Go sit up at the Pilot. PETER: What's the Pilot? BOB: The Pilot truck stop. There's some unsavory characters up there. Wouldn't you say? PETER: They're just peddling meth over there? -No they're just... You'll get it. ROBERT: They are the truly homeless, most of them. -They are, um... Every one of 'em is wearing a fricken' duster. Old Western Duster and... -[Mike offended] Hey, man. -I'm not saying... [all laughing] ROBERT: They are an eclectic bunch. -To say the least. BOB: They're travelers. ROBERT: It's funny, they all have dogs... ...and they panhandle, and try to get your sympathy for the dog. You know, \"My dog's hungry, can you give me a couple extra dollars.\" And then you give them a couple dollars and they go buy booze. MIKE: When they leave, they dump the dogs in the desert. PETER: Do you guys feel disconnected from the country at all? Like you're in your own world out here? You're not following politics or you feel very much connected with... BOB: Well I do anyway. Like, I have a whole system of checking out things. So I'm constantly doing that anyway 'cause I just do it. I've done it for years but... It can be a dreamworld. Especially when you're traveling, traveling. It\u2019s a dreamworld. But then... Which is real? Is this real or is the \"back in the world\" real? Because it's kind of a dreamworld back in the world too. ROBERT: You can be as disconnected... You can be as disconnected as you want to out here. If you want to continue following what's going on in the real world then you got internet. You got your cell phone, you got internet, what have you, but if you truly want to be done with all of that... You can be. BOB: There's lots of delineations and echelons of quote-unquote society out here. Because you have RVers who are only here if they're snowbirds. So they're gonna go back to Ypsilanti, or Lansing, or Chicago, or Minneapolis. -Okay. -When the weather gets warm up there. Then there's people out here who are just here. We're nomads 'cause we're gonna go to Colorado in the summer or Utah. I'm gonna go back to Wisconsin or whatever. Um... And the real nomads, the schooly people mostly, lot of van-life people, they live in their vans, and they tour, and they go around, and they're in 'em 24 hours a day, and they either have YouTube channels or they have some digital work that they do. -Okay. -And they have means of support. Other people are on disability, or they're on Social Security, or whatever, and they have money. -Right. -So it's... People do it and they come down here because... So if you wanted to go to the Keys. Well, it's gonna cost you a fortune. Where as here you pay $180 at the LTVA. You've got, you know, an RV like that one... -Yeah. -So you've got a beautiful house. You can just go sit in your house all day if that's what you want. -So it's all different types of people doing this? -All different types of people. -Okay. -You see there's a nice fifth wheel over there. There's a bunch of beautiful Class A's. Which are the, you know, it's like you drive... Like, they're big busses basically. And those things are $400,000, $500,000. -Are there any socioeconomic divides? Like someone's got the Class A, they're not gonna hang with you 'cause you're in the ambulance or all that stuff goes away out here? Well, we get a little irritated with some of the trailer people because most of them bring generators and they just run their generators all day, and sit in there, and watch television. And so we get a little irritated. -Okay. -This guy in the trailer over here, he's got a CPAP machine. So he has to charge up his batteries during the day. So we give him a pass. -Okay. -But the trailer people, the snowbird people are a little... They like to gather in groups and I think they're probably people that they live with back in their other... And they all get together. -Sure. -Or they have friends and they get together, you know? If you have the resources and you have the money, who am I to say it's right or wrong? But if you have high levels of resources, and people come into this with different levels of resources. Some people have no resources, some people have some resources, and you just go with what you got. Once it hits you that you want to do this, well, you know, I said, \"I don't want to do this in my ambulance.\" \"I need to do something.\" So... and the more I looked at the ambulance sitting in the driveway I thought, \"Well, I've got the truck.\" I know it's a 7.3 diesel, it's dependable, it's a great platform. I know it's gonna run. Finally I was like... So I had to literally get rid of everything because there's no room in there for anything. But I'm telling you, everything I sold, I felt better, and better, and better, until the whole place was empty. And then I felt great. So it's just, you know, some people couldn't do it 'cause they couldn't give all that stuff up. \u266a country guitar \u266a [truck driving on gravel] PETER: It's so beautiful out here. \u266a mellow music from campsite \u266a The colors of the desert. Dark blue, lighter blue, out to the orange. Soft breeze, perfect temperature. PETER: How you doing? MAN: Doing good, how are you? PETER: How ya doing? MAN: Good, what can I do for you, sir? PETER: Oh, I'm just making a video of the whole area, is it all right? -Yeah. -No, my poster might be on the post office somewhere. [all laughing] PETER: Do you guys live up here? -I am going to sleep here tonight, yes. -You live here for the moment? Okay. -Yeah, I live here, for three weeks I'll be here. -But he's been full-time for two years now. -Oh, no way. -Travel all over the United States and Canada. -Where you from? -Louisiana. -Oh, okay, never been there. -Based out of Ohio now but South Louisiana, I was raised. -Okay. -People... This is Mark, Cajun Mark. -Cajun Mark, Peter Santenello. -Hi, Peter. -Yeah, nice to meet you. [to the tune of Santeria by Sublime] \u266a I don't practice Santenello \u266a \u266a I ain't got no crystal ball \u266a -It's Italian. [all laughing] PETER: Do you guys live near each other or you're just old friends that get together? -No, no, he invited me over for dinner a few minutes ago. -We just met. I just met him. -I've only known this guy for a couple months. -Oh. -We met in... -We met this guy... -It's that type of place? -It is, you meet a lot of people. -Exactly that kind of a place. -You catch up with them, you know, and say, \"Hey, I'm in this part of the country.\" and you go camp with 'em for a while. -It's a good vibe out here. -Yeah, that's why I'm out here. -But everybody comes down here in this area for the winter. This is the new Florida. PETER: So you live out of this, Nicole? NICOLE: I live out of this thing. -Full-on bike stand... Oh, that's cool. -It's my son, he did this build. [laughs] -All right, show us the home. Show us the home. -I'll show it off. My stove, it's not gonna come out right now. I have issues with how he back here... the connection but someone can help me. This platform folds down. -Okay. -Right here and that's my bed. -Okay. -It's all tucked... I have to take it out and, you know, put it away every time but... -When did you make this choice to live like this? -It's been about an eight year in the making for me. -Wow. -And I am finally living out of this thing and have been for about seven months. So little by little, I got closer and closer, you know? -Okay. You're a cyclist? -Yeah, I am. Not heavy-duty cyclist but [laughs] just a means of... This is built to get me far off-road somewhere. -Okay. -And then I have an awning and I can add walls to it and if that's the case I need another means of transportation. I have my backpack up top. -So what do you get out of this lifestyle? Like what do you feel out of it? Oh, freedom and where I need to be on this planet. Honestly, like... -Okay. -And it's just living this and giving back to whatever I can give back to... ...as a collective. -Okay. -I'm not bound to a time frame. I am not bound any of it. It's just me and the road, and me, and, you know, people... -Do you meet people out here? -Oh, I meet cool as hell people out here. -Medicine Bear. -Where's Medicine Bear? -He's in there right now. We just went on a hike earlier today. We were just over in this ridge line over here and we went on a hike and he's... Maybe he's crashed-out in there. [both laughing] -And he is legitly a medicine bear. You look at him and you're like, \"You are Medicine Bear.\" -So it's all types out here, right? -It's all types. -It's everyone? -Oh it is, and it's cool 'cause there's a thread, and that thread is just like, \"What can I do for you?\" \"What can I do to make your experience a little easier?\", you know? -Okay. -You know, everyone's within their own little section or whatever. -Okay, okay. -There's more parties in certain sections, there's more, like, you know, meditation in certain sections, but I could walk over there and, like, say hi to someone over there and... You know what I mean? -You just do that? You just walk to whomever? -Yeah. -It's almost like you're doing something independently but collectively in a way. -Yeah, yeah. -So it drops the guard. And, like, every door is open in a way. -Yeah. Like you can go talk to... -Collectively, we're tied. I had no idea this community even existed. -Where are you from originally? -Until, like, three weeks ago. -Originally from Utah. -Okay. -So do you get more community out here than in typical life, let's call it? -Yes, I do. -Okay. -I mean, maybe I've lived in a home, and I have neighbors, and it's like, am I getting into their living spaces? And, like, you know what I mean? It's just different here. -You have adult kids? -I have adult kids, yes. -What do they think of it? -They know this is me. -You look happy. You look very happy. -Well, it's like... You know what I mean? I hope that's what just exudes and gives back to this planet, so... -Now mom is cool? -Mom was always cool. -Yeah, yeah. -Mom's rocking the Tacoma with the mountain bike. -Oh, yeah. [both laughing] -Look at that moon. -Yeah, I know. Full in, like, three days from now. -Oh cool, take care. -Yeah, see you. -See you. All right, guys. That's it for today. Nice little view into Quartzsite, or Greater Quartzsite, Arizona. A few takeaways. It's got a good vibe here. All different types of people, different walks of life, different socioeconomic situations, but it seems quite respectful, and... Very interesting, gotta say. I could definitely come out here for a few weeks. Wouldn't be living, but could come out here for a bit. All right, guys, thanks for coming along on that. Until the next one. \u266a country guitar \u266a"
