Counter-Strike 2 is official, and for some, it’s coming today. 
In a post on Twitter, Valve writes that a limited test for CS2 is starting today, 
which it describes as an “overhaul to every system, every piece of content, 
and every part of the C-S experience.” A website for the game describes it as 
“the largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike’s history” and promises 
years of updates and new features.

The full game is expected to release in summer 2023, according to the game’s 
FAQ. It will be free to play.

CS2 is based on Valve’s Source 2 engine and includes updates to some of the 
game’s core mechanics, including improved smoke grenades and “sub-tick updates” 
that Valve says will let “servers know the exact instant that motion starts, 
a shot is fired, or a ‘nade is thrown.” (A video also appears to show someone 
clearing grenade smoke with another grenade.) The game will also have revamped
 maps, better visuals, UI enhancements, reworked audio, and more.

 In a video titled “Leveling Up The World,” Valve says that maps will be 
 getting a new look in CS2 but that experienced players’ skills should carry 
 over. The company also talks about the three “tiers” of maps in the games. 
 There are “touchstone” levels, such as Dust II, that have minor visual tweaks
 but that are essentially unchanged and that should let people get a feel for 
 the new gameplay in a familiar setting. There are also maps that have been 
 upgraded or overhauled, which have either had Source 2 features added or 
 have been entirely rebuilt.

There’s also a dedicated bind to remove your weapon’s silencer, according to 
a tweet.
