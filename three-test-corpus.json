      "corpus": "- We're gonna fly on this jet that costs half a million dollars per flight and we're also gonna fly on a $25,000 private jet, a $10,000 first-class seat, a blimp, and so much more. But before I show you what it's like to fly on some of the most luxurious plane on the planet, we're gonna fly on the cheapest plane in the world. It's really rickety. Here's the dollar. I'm very nervous. - Nothing to be nervous about. I've done this half a dozen times. - You've done this six times? (lively music) (engine whirring) Why does this sound like a lawn mower engine? (Doug laughing) Time for ride on world's cheapest plane ticket. (lively music) Oh boy. Oh my... Oh my gosh, round up. We're going so fast. - Come on, get it. - That does not sound safe. - Nah ah. (wind whooshing) - They almost hit the camera. - Whoo! - What are you doing? - Keep your seatbelt on. - Uh, you just focused on keeping me alive, Doug. - I'm trying. (engine whirring) - All right, he's in there. - All right, dibs on the channel. - I got what I need. You can land whenever. - (laughing) No. - Doug, come on. Doug, please. - That guy pays my bills. Be careful. - And if you guys think this is crazy, wait until later in the video when we have the world's most expensive plane ticket on the planet. - Wait a minute, you're making me feel bad. - Oh my god, he's coming in hot. (engine whirring) - [Doug] Get ready to land. (metal clanking) - Almost. - [Group] Yeah. - We're on the ground, we survive. - [Person] Our next plane is the $1,000 first class plane ticket. - But here's the thing, boys. I bought all the first class seats, so, sit wherever you want. - Would you like some miracle mist lotion? - Why? - Because first class, baby, fine dining, huh. - [Person] Each of us has our own seat and TV. The ticket also comes with a decent meal, a free bag of toiletries and pajamas. - Do we get to take all this home with us - [Person] And during longer flights... - Recline. We should recline into a bed. - I feel like I'm in a coffin, which I like. - Yeah, this is crazy. - [Person] And best of all... - My favorite part about this $1,000 plane, I don't need to speak to Nolan. - I don't like this glass 'cause it like separates me. I'm all alone back here. - That is the exact reason why I like it. - [Person] The only downside is that you don't get a lot of privacy. - [Chris] It's really awkward filming a video with all these people walking by. - [Person] So, let's see what a plane ticket 10 times more expensive will feel like. - And now, the $10,000 plane ticket. Oh man, this is nice. I have unlimited legroom here. Look, let's start off by analyzing what we get. A tablet, a giant touchscreen TV, my own in-seat drink bar, snacks. This isn't Feastables chocolate. I want a refund. - We're getting connected to the Wi-Fi. We might have paid $10,000 for our seat but we still have to pay $20 for Wi-Fi. - It's not free? - Now, we're taking off, which is pretty crazy because I can literally watch it on my TV and because it's a 16-hour flight, I get to take a... Look at how nice this bathroom is. You have a sink, a toilet, and then a shower. That is crazy. Look at that. We are 30,000 feet in the air and I can take a shower - [Person] On top of that, me and the boys can order as much gourmet food as we want. And that's not all, we save the best for last. - Hey, how's it going? - [Person] There's a private lounge in the back of the plane. - Hey, Jimmy. - Yeah. - Ow. - You're not dreaming. - That was the $10,000 plane ticket. Point the camera up and down. And now we're at the $25,000 plane ticket that is up these stairs. That's right, there's floors. - This is insane. - This is crazy. We're gonna be sitting above other people. - Oh my god. - Now, this is your room. - [Person] For $25,000, you get two massive rooms. - Oh, this is crazy. I've never seen anything like this. - Holy... - [Person] Our space on this plane is literally four times bigger than the last one. I've never seen a plane where I can comfortably do jumping jacks. Look at this. - [Person] We also get two chairs, a ton of TVs. - There are more TVs in this one room than all of the other planes we've been on - [Person] Food served by a personal flight attendant. - Why is it that after a certain price point, they always give you a caviar? - And the bathroom. - Can we talk about something? This bathroom is like a disappointment. No shower, no heated floors, half the size. I think the $10,000 flight was a better price point. - Would you pay this kind of money for a single flight? - I wouldn't recommend this. I would recommend a car. - Buy a car instead. - And now, the best part of the room, a queen size bed. Ooh. - Why don't they just make every seat a bed? - Bro, instead of three seats side by side, just put a bunk bed with three bed. (bright music) (audio squeaks) (hand thudding) - Good morning. That was really good sleep. - Karl, wake up. We're gonna land. - I slept like a rock. That was the world's most expensive commercial flight. Time for private flights. (screen whooshing) This is the $100,000 plane. - This thing's huge. - At this price point, you get the entire plane. (group cheering indistinctly) - Private, private. - Oh, it's like a yacht. - This is wild. - This is unbelievable. - You wanna know the craziest part? This is just one of four rooms. - [Karl] There's more to the plane, I thought this was it. - Guys, come over here. What room is this? - [Person] This is literally another lounge area with a bunch of snacks and a huge TV. And if you're feeling tired, you get your own private bedroom. - Dude, what? Wee. - This is like a hotel. - [Person] And last but not least, the bathroom. - Three, shut your mouth right now. Shut it. - Whoa. - This is insane. There's a seat in the bathroom. Dibs - Have you ever even seen a jet half this size? - No. - Never. - What do we talk about while on our private jet? - Well, I'll tell you, last year I had sold the (indistinct). - Oh no. Oh, wait. I just realized I'm taking off backwards (water bottle thuds) (GoPro thuds) - Whoa. - GoPro. - I didn't realize we were taking off. - Not the camera. Stop! - This is crazy. Whoa, oh. (Karl whistling) (group laughing) - Bro flew. - Oh my God. (person laughing) - I can just roll back. - Oh, turbulence. All right, I'm going to sit down. - This might be the best bathroom yet. This is the toilet. On the toilet you can watch TV. - Hey, Nolan, I hope you feel comfortable in the bathroom. - What's going on? I'm so confused. (door thuds) No, no. (laughs) - He's never getting out. - (gasps) What? - Oh wow. - I have steak, mashed potatoes, and veggies. And you guys inspired me a little bit, so I brought some pizza. - [Group] Yeah! (upbeat music) - This is my favorite plane because it has YouTube but we didn't pop up first, so now, it's not. - You can tell this is a rich person bed 'cause there's like 500 pillows. This one outta here. That one outta here. (singer sings in foreign language) - I'm gonna fly this thingy. - And that's the beauty of flying private. You can do whatever you want whenever. Karl's flying the plane, Chandler's jamming out the pizza. Chris is taking a nap and I don't even know where Nolan went. There's no layovers when you fly private and there's no TSA, so you save tons of time. Hence why? Basically, every rich person you know owns a private jet. - Hey, guys. - Yeah. - We're gonna land soon. - Karl, let me out. (hand thudding) - Where about... We're gonna land? You gotta let me out, bro. - Oh, oh. - Oh my God. That was the opposite smooth. - Wait, wait. Is Nolan still in the bathroom? - I don't know, really. - Karl, go let him out. - Oh, oh. - How was your flight? - Still better than the $1000 plane. (Karl laughing) - And now, the $300,000 blimp. I'll unblur it in a second. Before I remove your blindfolds, what do you think is on the side of the blimp? - Is it Nolan's phone number? - Did you do Nolan's phone number? - That would be funny. - Next time. - Take off your blindfolds. Turn turnaround. (person scream) (MrBeast laughs) (group laughing) - I heart Karl's mom. Hold up. Why? He really loves my mom. - No, Karl, he hearts your mom. He doesn't love your mom. That'd be weird. - No, I love her. - Oh. (blowing raspberries) - [Chandler] Dude, am I pushing it right now? - Ooh, it's like moving. - This giant aircraft can literally just be pulled by a rope. And you might be wondering how did I afford this giant blimp and pay six figures to wrap it? ZipRecruiter, a recruiting platform that I use to hire people like editors, cameramen, and accountants. Let's see if it stops floating when I get on it. (metal stairs thuds) - That's gains, dude. - Does that mean I'm fat? - It means you work out a lot. - Or I'm fat. ZipRecruiter is where people go to discover their next great job. If this blimp crashes, then I die. - Uh-huh. - You guys could just use ZipRecruiter to find a new job. - That'll make it so much easier. Thanks, man. - I feel like I don't like this conversation. - Shh, shh. All right, let's do this. Goodbye, Chandler. Goodbye, forever. (door thuds) - I think I heard forever. - [Chris] He could have promoted anything and he chose Karl's mom. - I'm terrified. This ain't picking up speed. - Well, we'll see you at the race. - [Person] Oh, and I forgot to mention, we're flying this blimp over 150,000 people at the world's largest race car event. And Karl has no idea. - Before I die in this blimp, I wanna tell you guys about ZipRecruiter. We recently made a job posting on ZipRecruiter and I'm gonna call one of the candidates and interview them. (phone ringing) Hey, Thomas. I saw your application on ZipRecruiter. Can you hear me? - [Thomas] Yes, I can. Is this MrBeast? - Yeah, I'm MrBeast, it doesn't matter. - [Thomas] Sorry, I can't barely hear you right now. - Yeah, because we're on a blimp. How long have you been an editor for? - [Thomas] I've been an editor for about 10 years. - Do you think you can improve our videos? - [Thomas] I think with a strong team and a little creative innovation, I can definitely make your videos better. - Okay, not bad. Send me some examples of your work. If like Thomas, you want a shot to come work for us, click the link in the description or go to ziprecruiter.com/mrbeast. We're gonna look at every single person that applies. (crowd cheering) (cars revving) We are now over the Daytona 500 which is one of the busiest events ever. - [Karl] You couldn't have put something better on the blimp. - No, this is perfect. - This is wrong. (laughing) - [Chris] Can they see us? - [MrBeast] You can see 'em. (screen dings) - Karl, I can confirm. Everyone loves your mom down here. - I love Karl's mom. - Everybody's like, \"We love...\" - [Crowd] I love Karl's mom. - Karl's mom, if you're watching, you're a lovely lady. - [Crowd] We love Karl's mom. - [Karl] You're a psycho. - [MrBeast] For your mom. (audio thuds) - [Person] And now, the most expensive private plane ticket on the planet. (upbeat music) - Hi, welcome board. I suggest you taking your shoes off. That carpet's actually $2 million. - She's like, \"I suggest it, really hard.\" - [MrBeast] And by square feet, this is bigger than our houses. - [Person] It's almost impossible to imagine how big this jet actually is. - Right here is a bedroom. - Wow. - A bedroom. Another bedroom, another bedroom. Keep going. This is for the crew, another bedroom. - Hoo! - What'd you find? - My dibs? - [Person] The bedrooms on this plane are way more extravagant. Gold plated sinks, multiple showers. - Wait, what's in there? - That's the toilet. - [Person] This plane comes with its own theater room, a lounge that can seat it up to 12 people. - [MrBeast] And then over here is the living room. - This is like a bigger couch than what I have in my house. - I just want you to know you've only seen a third of the plane so far. - There's more. - [Chris] What? Oh, got some good stuff. - You can call flight attendants in your bedroom. - If we could do this every time we fly, I'd live in the air. Whoa, whoa, what is that? - Sorry, I'm turning the lights on and off. - How did I miss this room? Like we walked around the whole plane - And in case you thought you saw everything, there's also massages on this plane. How is it, Karl? - It's amazing. - So, I really just shouldn't. (glass shattering) (Chris giggling) - Gentlemen, how were we able to afford this plane? - I would say only our fans. - [Person] And because of that, we invited a bunch of random subscribers on this half a million-dollar plane ride. - Have you ever flown on a private jet before? - No. This is my first time. - And it's the most expensive one on the planet. - I've never seen anything like this on a plane. Like this is crazy. - Ma'am, what is this right here? - That's gas station chocolate. - Can you just throw it? Okay. (chocolates thudding) - I didn't think she'd literally throw 'em. (stewardess laughs) This is the chocolate you need to serve from now on, okay? - Got it. It's called Feastables, It's the highest rated chocolate on the planet. - [Karl] What the heck is over this way? - [Chris] Yo, this gotta be a secret room. That's where the crew is. We just got a bunch of funny looks. (chuckles) - Attention, boys. We're about to take off. Fasten your seat belts, stop being hooligans. Thank you. (head thuds) (Nolan screams) (group laughs) Typically, what kind of people fly on a plane like this? - Business people. How do my dumb friends compare? - It's pretty dumb, I guess, I'd say. (MrBeast laughs) - [Person] At this price point, they serve the highest quality food anytime you want it and anywhere on the plane. Even in your own private master suite. - You want some? (audio smooching) (group laughing) - Do you guys even know where we're going? - [Group] No. - We're taking you all to Disney World and we're gonna give you two days of all expense paid trips to do whatever you want. (group indistinctly cheering) - No way. - So, if you wanna fly on the most expensive jet in the world and then spend two days all paid for in Disney World, subscribe. \u266a My life \u266a \u266a 'Cause of I'm baller for the rest of my life \u266a \u266a Yeah, yeah \u266a \u266a My life, my life, my life \u266a- Behind me is an assassin. And if he stabs me with this rubber knife by the end of the day, he wins a hundred grand. Here's your rubber knife. Good luck. - Get me outta this rope. (siren wailing) (person grunts) (lever clicks) - What you do? (person grunts) - [Chandler] I can't get out. - [Mr. Beast] Later boys. I left you a car in the woods. (suspenseful music) - What? Are you out? - This video is gonna be the craziest video you've ever seen. We have a real tank, an entire carnival, I'm blowing up a bank, and so much more all to escape this real assassin. You wanna watch this video. - Oh my God, he's just driving away. - [Assassin] We gotta hurry guys. - I'm gonna stab that guy. - There's a car somewhere in the woods we have to find. - [Assassin] Guys, there's the car. - [Karl] Are you sure this one's for you? - Pretty sure. (people laughs) - [Chandler] Go, go, go. - And now we're arriving at the train station. There are dozens of train cars in this massive warehouse. It's going to take him forever to find me. Inside this Cars backpack is not only a hundred grand but also a tracker giving him my real time location. - Okay, I found Jimmy. He seems to be stopped at like a warehouse just up ahead. - What's it look like around the warehouse? - It seems like where all the trains go. - Yeah. (Karl chuckles) - How did Jimmy find an assassin for this anyway? - I found Jimmy, he didn't find me. (suspenseful music) - Giving the assassin a car made him think this would be easy, but it's time for a reality check. (screen whooshes) Chris, are you in the tank? - Yeah, where did we get a tank from? - Don't worry about that. When the assassin and the boys are in the warehouse destroy their car. - Roger that. Over and out. - So, I've seen the other guys that chased Jimmy. He's gonna be ready there for us. So, you can point and laugh and call us nerds. Well, that ain't gonna happen this time. All right guys, we're pulling in. And we're gonna get right up next to the building. And then we're gonna slip in that open door over there. - He's so intent. There's a camera. There's a camera right there. Right there. (intense music) (suspenseful music) - Let's see if he's back that way. - [Chandler] Let's go. - Chris, they're inside the warehouse, you know what to do. - Roger that. Bravo six going dark.. Destroy the car. (Chris screaming) (tank whirring) (graphics thump) (laughs) Oh, my God. - Chris, how's the flattening going? (Chris screaming) - [Assassin] What is going on? - [Chandler] How did I not see this? - [Assassin] Is this a door? - [Jimmy] We gotta go, we gotta go. Come on. - Hey, something's definitely in there. (suspenseful music) (glass shattering) - Right here is our getaway car. (glass shattering) Go, go, go. - [Assassin] Go, go, go, go. (object clattering) (van crashing) - [Jimmy] Holy crap. Get us outta here. - [Assassin] Go, go, go. - Whoo! Was that epic? That was insane. It's gone. We gotta get to the car. Let's go. All right. Oh, no. Are you kidding me? - What? - They ran over our car with a tank. - I ran over your car with a tank. - Jimmy. - What up? - Our car is literally a pancake right now. - Yeah, you can Uber to the next location or you can buy a new car. Up to you. (screen whooshes) - [Assassin] Is that our Uber? Hello. We're right behind him, step on it. All right guys, he's on the highway traveling east. - Oh, he's just running down that highway. He's going. Where are we? - We are far. - Oh. - Now we're at the hotel where we rented every room. So, these are our room keys. (laughs) I'll even there for the assassin, I don't need 'em. And while we're waiting for the assassin on the 20th floor, we have over a hundred cameras monitoring every inch of the hotel. - I've seen his tracker stop here. This place is huge. Probably a million rooms in it. He's not gonna get away from us again. Alright, fellas. Tracker's telling me he's inside. - Oh, what is this? - This doesn't look right. - We got room keys. (audio thudding) 10th floor. - Is there a doofus on the line? - You're not very stealthy. Since you just walkied? me, that means you're within walkie-talkie range. Which means you're now in the hotel which I didn't know you were in. - That's my bad. - Oh. - [Jimmy] I'm hiding in one of over 200 rooms in this hotel. I also put a little something in every room. Good luck. (assassin gulps) - I knew it. (cap thuds) - I just want to get up there quick and just get on him as fast as possible. - [Karl] Let's do this. Here we go. Do you hear this? (person screaming) (lock clicking) What is not in here? - [Assassin] Nope, this it ain't guys. (relaxing music) (door clicks) (elegant trumpet music) He's not in here, let's go. - [Jimmy] Oh, they are on the 10th floor, oh my gosh. Mr. Assassin, look up at that camera. - How about this one, Jimmy? (shoe smacks) - We still have a hundred other cameras. (footsteps thumping) - Jimmy. (footsteps thumping) Coming in, Jimmy. - [Karl] What's up guys? (footsteps thumping) No way. (footsteps thumping) (object thudding) - [Assassin] Jimmy. - [Karl] 18. - What floor are they on? - 18. - 18. - 18? Oh, wait a minute. I might need to (hands rustling) get ready. Mr. Assassin, here's the deal. You're running out of time and we both know you're never gonna find me without a hint. I'll give you the exact location to me in this hotel, if you tie up Chandler and Karl in room 1802. - [Assassin] Yeah, I'll tie these guys up. - Don't talk to me until you do that. (walkie-talkie explodes) I hope that didn't break, 'cause I need to talk to him. - [Assassin] Oh, my legs. - [Karl] Oh, man. - [Jimmy] Hey, Karl. - Yes, Jimmy. - I want you to know it's not personal. - It feels pretty personal. - Alright, let's go. - I'm so tired, I'm not gonna fight it. - I know we didn't help you much. (Chandler coughs) And we let Jimmy get away. - I hope you get him. Stab him good. - Little do they know I'm literally two floors above them right now. - Yeah, it's nothing personal guys. All right, Jimmy. These guys ain't going nowhere. - Mr. Assassin, here's your hint. I'm on the 20th floor. - Go. - Do it for your daughter. - And now that he knows where I'm at I'm gonna try to do an ad read without getting stabbed. TurboTax is the number one way to get the biggest tax refund possible. On average last year, people get over $3,000 on their tax refunds. That's a lot of money. Can you gimme like one minute to finish this ad read? (footsteps thumping) (crickets chirping) He didn't respond. I should probably start moving. TurboTax will do your taxes, wherever you are. Even if you're running from an assassin. (door thuds) Last year, TurboTax helped people get over $113 billion in tax refund. (alarm blaring) Oh, God, that means he's up here. All right. (footsteps thumping) Come on. (button clicking) (elevator chimes) Here with TurboTax you can be confident your taxes are done right. (alarm blaring) And you're probably wondering if there was an elevator, why didn't he take it all the way to the top? (elevator chimes) Well, 'cause I hid it with a secret wall. (wall thuds) (grunts) That hurts. A little too good of a secret wall. (bag thudding) (alarm blaring) (suspenseful music) Whoo! Don't wait until April 18th to do your taxes. Click the link description and get your tax refund right now with TurboTax. Doing ad read while running from an assassin is very stressful. Mr. Assassin. - Jimmy. - Listen to this real quick. (door clanks) That's my door to my getaway vehicle later, nerd. (walkie-talkie thuds) - He just ninja flipped outta here again. (screen whooshes) - This time we're making our exit in a Lamborghini. Tareq, what up. - Wait, what are you doing? - An assassin's currently running down 20 flights of stairs to stab me. - Oh, well we gotta go. - You're the driver. - All right, hold on, I need to learn how to drive this thing. - I don't even know how we got down there so quick. Part of me wishes I still have the boys right now. - Is this your first time driving a Lamborghini? - Yes. - Oh, my God, whoa. - We gotta get back on our ride. - We're going to the helicopter. It's gonna fly us to a bank and then we're gonna blow up the bank. (graphic thumps) (bag thuds) - Whoo. (helicopter whirring) (person speaking indistinctly) See you at the next location - Hey, stop, stop, stop. (helicopter whirring) Just missed him. Let's go. Let's go. Hundred grand. His tracker's moving so fast. Can't believe he's in a helicopter right now. - The helicopter put me way ahead and now the assassin has less than three hours to win a hundred grand. - That's the bank? - For now it is. Oh, God. Let's see if he can stab me while I'm hiding in this double reinforced steel bank vault. (walkie-talkie thuds) - Tracker stopped, luckily he didn't get too far. Now I have an opportunity to stab him before midnight and get my money. - How's it going? - Well, we're here. - I'm in the bank vault but I don't think you have enough time to break in. Good luck - Bank vault. Let's do it. Bank's open late. (suspenseful music) (door slams) - He just kicked out a door. (doors slamming) I think he's literally lost his mind. (doors slamming) (suspenseful music) (timer beeping) Oh, my God. (hands thudding) - You in there, Jimmy? (vault lock clanking) (door thuds) (Nolan laughs) - (laughs) He fell for it. He fell for it. - It worked. - It worked. Mr. Assassin, there's two bank vaults and you picked the wrong one. - Yeah, I saw one vault. Figured that'd be the one. - [Jimmy] Above the bank vault you're in is another bank vault. But you didn't pick that one. You picked the easy one and now you're trapped with Nolan. Is that a sledgehammer? (sledgehammer thudding) (audio whistling) This thing's double steel reinforced, it doesn't matter. (sledgehammer thudding) - I really did fall for it, pretty bad at this one, didn't I? - [Nolan] Yeah. - Chris, see that hook right there? I need to attach it there. I'm gonna attach this one here. And we'll get you outta here in just a second. Get comfortable, we might move a little bit, okay? - You say get comfortable. - Hold on to something. (wall cracking) (Chris grunts) - There's some activity going on right outside of the door here. - Well, one, I might actually win the challenge. The only thing standing between that safe and the road is this brick wall. - Are you telling me to rob a bank? - Yeah, actually I am. - [Chris] And (indistinct). - Why is this thing moving. - [Jimmy] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. (upbeat rock music) (Nolan grunting) - What is happening? - You didn't tell me about this part. - I can't believe that worked. If you're gonna rob a bank, why don't you just do it like this? Nolan, has the assassin attacked at you yet? - Well, I'm talking to you, Jimmy, so no. - Darn. Now we're gonna drive you 10 miles down the road. - I can't take this. - Yeah, we're not going on the highway, are we? - You have one hour left to win this hundred thousand dollars. I'll make your transportation quick. All right, get 'em outta here. (vault crashing) - Did we get lifted up into the air at some point? (triumphant music) - [Jimmy] Oh, and as promised. (bank explodes) (upbeat music) Literally, everything has gone according to my plan. I crushed his car, bamboozled him at the hotel, escaped in a Lamborghini and a helicopter, and now he's trapped in a safe with Nolan. There is less than 40 minutes left in the challenge. So we're heading to one last location, because keeping him in a bank vault kind of feels like we're cheating. For our last location, we built a carnival, but all of this is a very expensive and elaborate distraction while I'm gonna try to fake a serious injury and see if he still stabs me. I'm gonna give him one last chance. This time, face to face. The truck is now here with the safe. I'm gonna go over there and break my ankle. All right. (ladder thuds) (siren blaring) I've never broken a film before. We ended the production and had the camera crew leave. The only cameras that kept rolling were hidden spy cameras from far away. There's 20 minutes left in the challenge. Let's see if he still stabs me even though I'm hurt. I think you should let him out, Tareq. Guy, get ready. Get ready. (door creaking) - Guys, Jimmy got hurt. - [Assassin] Really? - [Tareq] Literally, get out. Jimmy got hurt. - [Jimmy] No, it just hurts. (person speaking indistinctly) - [Assassin] What happened? - My foot. - He fell off the ladder. - Right, so where (indistinct) - Finished wrapping up- - Got all this for a broken ankle, huh? - Yeah. (suspenseful music) (knife clinks) - Yeah, I don't know about that. (suspenseful music) (heart beating) - So, was it that obvious? - Whoo! Let's go! (triumphant music) You don't splint a broken ankle. - That is true. I should have broke my leg. I was hoping I'd get away with it for at least a little bit. Here's your a hundred thousand dollars. - This means a lot to me and my family. Thank you. - Well, now I'm glad you stabbed me. That was a weird sentence. Thank you guys for watching. - Subscribe or I'm gonna hunt you down. \u266a Mr. Beast goes \u266a (bank explodes) - Jimmy is it over? - Jimmy (hotel explodes)"

Believe It or Not TGI budget just couldn't afford it so I grew it myself it's Chris Evans playing it's not a gym a genius typically didn't want bio it's almost like Almost Famous how Almost Famous isn't about a band it's about a boy that loves a band so so Gene is more than ancillary character but we're still we're still tweaking it I would love to though I want to see that it's Chris Evans the killer Knives Out well well you've seen the movie right right it's so funny for a split second came about years ago we can all say yes he is nasty right well in ghosted we actually get to like each other yeah films we've done we're very adversarial so for this movie we actually get to kind of uh enjoy each other's company well it's kind of like the like hate like thing again yeah I think like as in real life our relationship has evolved here we finally get to to have a good time together yeah not trying to kill each other no not hating each other we kiss yeah we do and the beer is real is Chris Evans dad a dentist he is a dentist which you know I need an appointment I mean no longer he's retired now but uh he was my dentist growing up you know I had braces for a long time did God punish you with the braces trust me the orthodontics yeah truly was Christmas Evans child actor you're not a professional child actor I mean I do plays you know that is being an actor I guess I mean I imagine it more being like someone who's actually on sets getting paid you don't need to get paid to get an actor trust me then I guess I was a little you know kid actor yeah is Anna De armas a Bond girl yeah about girl I didn't have a romantic story with bond which is usually what happens but I am a Bond girl in no time to die and it was one of the most wonderful experiences I've ever had on set I love that chicken character yeah stole the movie I'll do it I thought you're gonna say the next Bond girl then you just said bye oh man I don't know I think Paul McCall should be the one almost no martial arts I pretend to know martial arts but no I mean I've done some boxing or kickboxing but not enough those are disciplines that require a lot of time and years of study and training and all of that and I have not done that is anode I miss whoops Cuban Cuban am I cute one that was a really long thing for the word Cuban see sorry now I'm Cuban I was born in Havana lived there until I was 18 years old and then I moved to Madrid and I still have my family there at my home and I miss it every day I love my country yeah does Andre armas have tattoos see I have two one little Moon here and one little heart on my ankle is anode in John Wick is she you haven't seen jungwick the last one no it wasn't raining I'm not I'm not I'm not in John Wick I wish because I do love this franchise so much that's why I I was so excited and so happy to be called for the follow-up in ballerina it's a spin-off of John Wick and it happens between John Wick three and four and 2024 ballerina is coming out and I'm so excited how did Chris Evans get cast as Captain America luck they wanted me to come in and read and I was apprehensive it was a back and forth it was a little bit of a dance it was something I was really nervous about doing and luckily they were really good people in my corner who kept nudging me Kevin feige and Robert and a lot of great people kind of talked me into it in his best decision in my life uh I had to sneeze that whole answer and it never came so I'm sorry if it seemed like my head was somewhere else going to cities now no it's gone now how did Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson meet meet we met on the set of uh perfect score we were both really young you know I think after that movie she went off to do Lost in Translation and her whole world changed but yeah we've known each other a really long time and she's one of my dearest friends we've done how many films I mean all the Marvel movies we've done eight movies together this I'm not liking this yeah we're wrecking them up though what are we trying to say we're getting there okay I still have five more to go how tall is Chris Evans really like really really be honest six feet six one with the right shoes it can be six feet yeah you're taller than that thank you but really yeah really okay what is Ana de armas real name my name is and has no explanation Anna Celia de armas sounded great to me what is Ana de armas in Blade Runner I play Joy and she's a beautiful hologram from the future what was Andre armas what was that iris's first movie I just told you oh it was a good name um and it was it sounded great it was una Rosa de Francia it was a cop production with Cuba and Spain that was my first film sounds a lot better than Not Another Teen Movie what car design of the armis drive Land Rover because I need it I live in a complicated areas so I need something strong handle that would take me through anything what color eyes does Andre Hermes have yes yes they're Hazel right no they're like yellow yeah it's not the same as Hazel yellow green oh yeah okay you look great what is Chris Evans okay what is Chris Evans job this next one we could be better what was your job a year ago well yeah it was I was working on a movie go so that you should all go see that's my job ghosted yeah he's a creep what is it is your sweater sweater what knives out well I assume but I can't even like wrap my head around the question it's like a Jeopardy what brand what is Chris evans's sweater um that's literally what that feels like next one dog breed I did that little swab once and it came back boxer pit lab Pomeranian what good but what is can you have one word for it what breed is it he's a mutt okay what is Christina's favorite football team it's a no-brainer Patriots all right what is that this is a TV show that I did in Spain when I moved why did you leave it I started this show when I was like 19 and I was playing a school student for three years and I just felt like oh it's time to move on I'm not really doing much more here I've done everything I've had to do so it's time to go to go and I asked him to kill me and they did why why on a date she's so beautiful yourself why well it's my hazel eyes the Hazel yellow yeah is the Hazel the Frijoles that's it I had to skateboard for Scott Pilgrim and you know I I got okay at it I guess but you know I can stay on it I can stay on I can snowboard really well that's like my favorite thing to do in the world and Chris Evans do flips yeah yeah we grew up with the trampoline but I grew up in the world where the trampolines didn't have those Nets you know what I mean I'm like come on you got to get bounced off this thing and break a bone at least once in your childhood and Chris Evans speak another language and I can fake it I can get by if I you know listen hard enough if someone's speaking Spanish I pick up every like third word Kendra you know that's not true I know the beginning we were like uh uh your opinions okay I'm like I think that okay I'm like I feel that that's it you're doing great uh I can but there's some horrible thing online I had to do something I pressed for Marvel where I was on stage and had to draw something really quickly in front of like 5 000 people and I drew this shield and the first Circle was it's like I drew it blindfolded with my left hand so then I had to follow that and I flip my thing it looks like a monkey Droid but I actually can kind of draw don't don't just not that day just not that day not under pressure is on a day armis left-handed no I'm not left-handed I'm right-handed but I was told when I was little I used to grab like do more like left-hand stuff for some reason my parents just got me used to the right hand I think that's it wow that's just wrong is Anna Day armis the new Wonder Woman well I feel like Gal Gadot is doing a great job so you know I think she should keep doing that yeah yeah is Andrea Miss yeah yeah I've been in a couple of diamond commercials I was doing this campaign for for diamonds for a little bit but not anymore is Anna De armas nominated for Alaska yes I was it called a few weeks ago I was nominated for an Oscar and it was pretty incredible and very special especially because I loved the project blonde was a very unique movie and roll for me and it was wonderful to be recognized for that I was nominating for a kid's choice of work thank you go see ghosted on uh apple plus did I say that what you nailed it Apple TV PlusI'm Brian Greene and today I have been challenged to explain a topic in five levels of difficulty we're going to be talking about the nature of time the most familiar and the most mysterious quality of the physical Universe there is nothing that we experience that does not take place in some duration of time so if you can understand time you're on your way to understanding reality [Music] hello hello what's your name Kayla how old are you Kayla I am nine years old so if you're nine years old what does that mean about the Earth how many times has it gone around the Sun nine times nine times so there's a relationship between motion through space the Earth is going through space and the passage of time they're kind of connected in some way but there are differences right if I asked you to move through space you could do it freely right can you get up and let's see how easy it is to move through space can you move over to that location and can you come back anything getting in your way easy to do yep if I were to ask you to sit perfectly still in space can you do that I mean hold perfectly still that's good but if I ask you to hold still in time to not go to the next second or the next second can you do that no so there's definitely this difference between space and time some fundamental quality that distinguishes how freely we can move through space versus how freely we can move through time have you heard of Albert Einstein yes what do you know about him yes please here and I think I may be heading in that direction actually he showed us an approach to travel to the Future you want me to tell you how you do it you build a spaceship you go out into space really quickly you turn around and you come back to planet Earth and he showed us that when you're on that ship your clock will tick off time more slowly you will age more slowly so that Journey may only take you say a year six months out and six months back but you know what when you step out of the ship it'll be a hundred years into the future or a thousand years a million years into the future would you do that if you could I would probably be dead by that no you'd be alive that's the amazing thing I'd be to everybody else would be dead who stayed on Earth but your body would only age one year and yet it would be a thousand years into the future the question though is could you get back and I don't know the answer to that nobody does we don't know if you can travel back but we certainly know that you can travel forward has anyone ever tried to go forward and back I don't think so that same guy with the crazy hair Albert Einstein showed that there's actually a limit to how fast things can go and you know what the limit is the limit is the speed light because light travels 671 million miles per hour that is fast enough to go around the entire Earth seven times in one second so if we could build a spaceship that would go as fast as light we'd be able to do what Einstein noted there's something else that's really curious about time things tend to go in One Direction and we call it the arrow of time it sort of points from the past into what we call the future if you'd ask me why is there an arrow to time ask me why is there an error at the time I'm not really sure I have some ideas but I'd say we've still not completely nailed it down Kayla what have you learned about time from talking about it here that you can't really travel back through time and can you travel to the Future in Prince maybe maybe that's absolutely right I think it's unlikely we'll learn how to travel to the past but it's not been ruled out that's kind of exciting that it's still at least an open possibility if I was to ask you what is time what would you say time is kind of strange because it's almost a man-made idea there is the tangible of you know how the Earth revolves around the Sun or how we orbit around ourselves it's almost in a way does it exist if the way that we measure it is man-made before there's any life on planet Earth I think we all agree the universe existed did things change before there was life on Earth yes and how would you talk about that change without invoking this concept of time it's difficult to talk about something without adding time into it even if it is a human-made concept that the Universe evolved developed changed Through Time ultimately giving rise to Galaxy stars planets and on this particular Planet life that conception of time gives it feel that it's like Universal that it's out there it's the same for everybody it's independent of our actions or activities do you know that Albert Einstein shattered that view of time he found that if you and I say have identical wrist watches I'm sitting still and I'm watching you move I will find that your clock is taking off time more slowly than my clock you know it's really remarkable you can figure out this quality of time if you know one fact that the speed of light is constant have you ever heard that phrase my freshman year physics class yeah if you're clever you can use that with high school algebra maybe even a little high school trigonometry to make it even easier to derive that clocks take off time at different rate do you want me to show you how that goes yes please right so to figure out the effect of motion on time I'm going to use a really simple clock it's called a light clock it's two mirrors that are facing each other and what we do is we have a little ball of light called a photon right that goes up hits the top mirror then comes back down and hits the bottom mirror and every time it does that you go Tick Tock that's one unit of time imagine now we have another one of these light clocks but I'm going to have it in motion now what do you notice about that path it's much longer it's much longer right this one's going tick tock tick this is going to go tick tick tock in fact we can figure out the ratio let's consider time on the stationary clock compared to time on this moving clock well that ratio is going to be the ratio of the lengths then this would be given by D over L more time on the stationary because it's longer distance on the moving clock well this length over here that's the same as this L over here right so we want D over L now you may have recalled that in trigonometry there's a name for L over d sine of theta opposite is l hypotenuse is d right and so this ratio is just 1 over sine of theta so if we can figure out 1 over sine Theta we'll have our beautiful formula for the ratio of time on the stationary clock to time on the moving clock we just need one other fact the speed of light along this diagonal is equal to what we call C C equals speed of light but in order for this ball of light to hit that point on the mirror the component of the speed of light in the horizontal Direction better be keeping perfect Pace with the speed of the clock itself so let's assume that this clock is moving in this Direction with the speed equal to V so c times cosine Theta must be equal to the speed of the clock in motion and from this we learn that cosine Theta is equal to V over C there's another beautiful identity you may recall from your study of trigonometry that sine squared theta plus cosine squared theta is equal to one this is really just a Pythagorean theorem in Disguise and from that we can now solve for sine squared theta equals 1 minus V over c squared and if for sine Theta is the square root of this and now we're basically done because we already had over here that this ratio is 1 over sine Theta which now is 1 over square root of 1 minus V over C squared so you see as V gets very close to C this gets very close to one one minus something very close to one is very close to zero one over something close to zero is huge which means the ratio of time on the stationary to time the moving that can be a huge number as the speed of the moving clock approaches the speed of light now I did this for a light clock but it's true for any clock and this is what Einstein discovered in 1905 with his special theory of relativity do you think that in the near or foreseeable future of humans as we know ourselves now will there be a time where we are using these formulas and these Concepts in our daily lives as technology progresses the barrier between the limitations of experience and the truth of how the world behaves in extreme environments will be moved in the very same way that you know we can toss a pack of gum and we know where to put our other hand to catch it well we have that kind of intuition about these ideas I think it's quite possible what are you studying right now I'm doing physics and computer science so have you spent any time thinking about this weird quality of the laws of physics that there's no mathematical distinction in the laws between forward and time and backward in time is that something you're familiar with yeah and the one thing that really confuses me there I'm thinking about uh one of the most basic things we learn I guess from Interstellar is that the universe is expanding or space is expanding and so I'm thinking how does that square with gravity and electromagnetism which is like kind of predicated on the density of charges or masses the fact that space expands is perfectly compatible with our understanding of all the forces of nature because all of them continue to operate in a somewhat more subtle way but we have a beautiful prescription for taking any law that we understand in the simpler context a flat space time and juicing it up so that it works in a curved space-time the more philosophical question is in any of those formulations if you replace T by minus t and you do it properly in the equations the equations still work but if past and future are kind of treated on equal footing in the fundamental equations why are they so different from the perspective of experience when you're talking about the perspective experience could you is that just human subjective experience or actual observation for physics well certainly it starts with human subjective experience but then we are able to elevate it to a more objective description for instance when we introduce words like disorder and order an entropy in the second law of Thermodynamics and the equation usually the way we say it is s equals K log W entropy equals boltzmann constant times log of a particular quantity which is ultimately counting the number of distinct configurations that A system can be in what boltzmann and others showed is that entropy tends to increase toward the future but the key word there is tends to increase so this Arrow of time going from the past to the Future rests on a curious Foundation it's a statistical Foundation which says that it's more likely for eggs to Splatter than unsplatter it's more likely for glasses to smash than unsmash but not that it's impossible for those things to happen you just have to wait a really long time for there to be a reasonable chance of it ever taking place when you said that um you know it's more likely for an egg to smash or for glass to smash and that's probably because there's so many atoms so much stuff going on yes but I'm thinking if we zoom in on like a single thing I guess do we have variations that are extremely unintuitive because you know things can happen in a way that isn't a statistical average if I take a film of that electron it's a little fanciful to describe it that language because you know about quantum mechanics and so forth but I take a film of a little particle moving around and I show you that film you'll be really hard-pressed to determine whether I've shown you the film running forward in time or whether I've shown you the film going in reverse time if I had two or three or four or a gazillion particles into the mix then it will be much easier for you to determine whether the film is going forward in time or backward in time but order and disorder don't have much meaning if there's only one particle and that's why the fundamental laws don't draw a distinction but the macroscopic experience does but it raises a key question where'd the order of the egg come from if everything goes toward disorder how do I get this orderly collection of atoms called an egg well you probably would say from a chicken but then I say to you where'd the chicken come from and you say from an egg but there's actually some real insight we can draw from this because if we keep going back with the chicken and egg story we'll go back through the evolutionary lineage of Life we'll go back to early moments of the sun and the Galaxy and ultimately the universe each step taking us to greater and greater order so we believe that the ultimate source of order is the Big Bang itself highly ordered beginning called the bank and we have been living through the degradation of that order ever since we still don't really have a solid explanation for why the Big Bang had to be or was high highly ordered at the moment it's really a deep assumption Einstein we wondered does time change with speed and that's another change with that before we didn't think possible but I guess we found out eventually some of the fanciful ideas I guess there's a tiny sliver of Hope yeah not only did we find that time changes with speed and special relativity but we also found that time changes with gravity Einstein showed that the rate at which a clock ticks slows down based upon the stronger gravitational field or gravitational potential actually that it is experiencing I think you mentioned Interstellar before do you remember the scene in interstellar they're going to a planet that's near a black hole they go down to the planet and they spend just a couple hours there but when they go back to the ship it's 23 years later on the ship because time is elapsing slowly near the strong gravitational field comparatively quickly far away and that's not science fiction that's actually how time behaves I've always heard people say oh general relativity you know it might not seem applicable but you know GPS due to satellites yeah we could synchronize those Clocks by accounting for relativity well but that's even a really really good point the GPS would become completely inaccurate in a very short period of time if the satellites weren't taking account of or the software wasn't taking account of the fact that time elapses differently for the clocks on the satellite compared to the clocks down here on Earth so we walk around with general relativity in our pockets even though most of us perhaps don't really know that have you started any projects yet or that's I'm just starting one right now I'm trying to figure out how stars in the galaxy are moving based on what they're made of which is interesting clearly time comes in to what you're doing to what extent do you have to Grapple with some of the subtle features yeah with my research in particular I really want to know what happened in the past and what happened in the future but you only get a single snapshot when you look up at the night sky right but if it's officially far back you're right and so we can learn a lot by looking at other galaxies and seeing what they were doing in in their present I suppose yeah just figuring out what's gonna happen next is is part of part of the issue yeah that's looking into the future I suppose and so have you taken general relativity are you taking that now or I took a course on general relativity yeah but you learned about black holes sure one of the weird things and wonderful things about wormholes is that they are tunnels if you will shortcuts from one point in space to another point in space but once you have a shortcut from here to there the beautiful thing is if you move the openings time will elapse differently at the different openings so there's a possibility of wormholes as time machines go One Direction you're going into the future go the other direction you'd be going into the past but that of course raises philosophical and logical Paradox paradoxism sort so what do you think what do you I throw it to you yeah I've heard a few different theories that people pause it maybe it is Back to the Future and you really change your own Universe I've also heard people say that you could have a multiple universes Spawn from this event or something yeah that's that's if you're going to be able to change the past that's the one that resonates most with me I think the same yeah so you go into the past and maybe you can prevent your parents from meeting but you're preventing them from meeting in a parallel reality which means that you will never be born in that reality but the origin of your birth is still completely understood it was in the universe from which you originated another one that's more subtle is the laws of physics May prevent you from interceding right and that raises uncomfortable issues for many people having to do with like free will I'm immediately uncomfortable yeah so that one there's actually some people like Joe who did some wonderful studies of billiard ball tables where you imagine a billiard ball goes into a wormhole comes out and hits the very ball that was going into the hole and in that way if it could knock it of course we seem to be in some logical Paradox absolutely but the finding was the ball can come out and just sort of graze the other one but it can't affect it enough to prevent the sequence of events from happening and the way I like to think about it frankly is if there's one Universe not parallel universes like in the other solution moments in time just are they don't change the whole point of time is the variable along which change can happen so if you have the atoms of time the individual events there's no conception of them changing so whatever collection of influences were in play that allowed your parents to meet they will always be in play because you were always part of that moment do you think travel back to the past is impossible because of a deep physical like mathematical reasoning or just because of all of these problems that you've been talking about I suspect that when we fully understand the mathematics of the final physical laws if we ever come upon them I think there's going to be something built in okay that prevents this kind of free travel to the past but sometimes I I wonder if that's just coming from a more emotional place where I sort of want the world to be safe from this kind of paradoxes so what pretty clear based on any of the hypothetical proposals for traveling to the past that have come out of physics you can't travel to a moment in the past before the first time travel machine is built sure you know the twin paradox yeah sure where you know you fly off looks like you're moving fast but to you it looks like the other guy is moving fast so who actually ages more who ages less yeah a resolution I've heard is that because you have to be going away and then coming back you had to accelerate at some point and this breaks the the ambiguity yeah what if say the universe isn't flat what if the universe is curved and you go off in One Direction and then you come back in the same direction you pass by the Earth who's older then yeah do we have an answer yeah we do have an answer so the simplest version of that is imagine that the Universe has a shape of a donut imagine I'm on the circular part of this donut Universe all right and imagine I turn on two laser beams sending a beam of light going to my right and to my left and these beams will go around the entire entirety of space and will both come back and at some point they will hit me imagine they hit me at the same moment from my perspective now imagine someone's moving relative to my frame of reference say to my left they do the same experiment they fire the beam of light left and right notice that the beam that they fired to their left will have to travel farther to reach them because they're moving away from it whereas the beam that they fired to their right will not have to travel as far because in some sense they're moving toward it the two beams of light will not hit that moving Observer at the same moment to you or to them to them wow which means that there's a preferred frame of reference in this universe everybody is not on equal footing as they are when we teach to freshmen the special theory of relativity that's right exactly no everybody else is moving relative to me and it's real emotion so everybody else will be like the moving twin they will be younger and I will be older and when you think about past and future on a cosmological scale there was a long period when there were no human beings in the universe the fact of the matter is there will be these two long stretches with our presence being sort of a flicker in between to that thought inform anything about how you live in your brief flicker within that brief flicker I rage against thinking like that yeah I think that's the perfect way to put it yeah because it might be a brief flicker on a single moat of dust like floating in a cosmic eternity yeah but it's everything yeah there's nothing else that I'll ever experience and so in a way there's there's nothing else to me yeah there's an eternity but I'm never gonna see it I'm never gonna feel it it can be debilitating to imagine an eternal future of sort of nothing or none of what we do sort of persists on the other hand if you flip your perspective around and say how remarkable is it that we have this brief moment that allows us to think and feel and love and explore and illuminate wow how wonderful is that yeah so often when we try to give the basic idea of what time is I'm fond of saying look space is the language that allows us to say where events take place and time is the language that allows us to specify when they take place where would you jump off from there and trying to give a deeper understanding of the basics of time maybe part of the distinction in between time and space it's that you have a clear irreversible Evolution so how to explain what time is well it's a parameter that is measured by clocks I mean at the end this is what we know and allows us to talk about change and also that we know how to describe in terms of some set of equations which gives a clear sense of causality to note our recent paper where we were thinking about Einstein's ideas of special relativity but in a setting where the global shape of the space-time if you imagine there might be a curled up dimension of space a circular Dimension and thought about how special relativity Works in that setting we came to result in this very basic setting you can send signals into the past not in a way that will violate causality did that surprise you that by going from the usual topology that doesn't have a closed part of space but making that one change you could have this radical impact I found quite surprising that you could have this exotic behavior of a signal propagation in a system that was extremely simple totally classical there was nothing weird except one dimension that was compactified was identified on a circle actually even the standard vanilla causal structure of special relativity may give some very unexpected behaviors when you combine it with other simple modifications of just the flat space time and the beauty of it is it's not like there is some high-powered mathematical methodology straightforward algebra that a high school kid would know is all that you need to extract these unusual results and they were unusual because even if you do not violate causality we discovered that a fast moving Observer that could be us on a rock it could send signals verifier and then back in a very small time so the old idea that of course we always hear about that if we ever make contact with extraterrestrial life they're far away we can't really have a conversation because we'll say hello and then like 10 000 years or a hundred thousand years later they'll answer us because it'll take that long for the signals but at least in this setup which we don't know is true of our universe but if it were then you could have a real time Conversation Over arbitrarily large distances yes which is that was unexpected yeah and so that shows how even ideas that seem to be well settled and well understood have surprises like why didn't Einstein realize this yes yeah maybe the idea of living on a Subspace or being confined in this extra dimension on a Surface may have been looked exotic but definitely did not look exotic after the 1990s many people have begun thinking about the possibility that space and time may be so-called emergent quantities that they're not as fundamental as perhaps Newton or Einstein would have thought where do you stand on that idea it seems not Unthinkable saying that something is emergent will make full sense only when we have some concrete model in which space and time emerging in which we make sense of this non-space non-time description of a theory I don't know if we are still at this stage in which I would say we begin to understand this scenario because often I tell my students the greatest scientific revolution has been not in the 20th century it has not been quantum mechanics nor general relativity no special relativity it has been the passage from the qualitative description of nature to quantitative one when you pass from asking how to how much right then you understand something and who do you credit with as that Newton do you go a little bit below I would say Galileo Newton of course the the completion of this idea is Newton one of the things that relativity also sheds a light on is what exists that if someone's moving relative to me what they consider now might be in my past what they consider now might be in my future which would suggest that all of time exists much says we're willing to accept that all of space exists does that hold water actually it resonates with me for various reasons one is that professionally we use space-time diagrams Penrose diagrams a lot of diagrams where space and times are just two axis on a board and when we describe a particle we have a line that goes up in time by the way this image also is the last image improves the last page there is this beautiful sentence which is also true saying that if he has the time he would like to describe people as being monstrous beings that extend in time much longer than in space if it's equal to one that's very true so this idea that you have a Continuum and the time should not be made to disappear as soon as it's gone it's very practical it's also what is behind the idea of histories in quantum mechanics when in the approach of various people including heart or collaborated a lot with Hawking there is this idea that what you describe is a history it's not a particular moment in time but it's an evolution this history treats space and time on a more equal basis but would you say there's more to it than the technical more to it than the diagrams more to it than sort of an interpretation of the mathematical equations when you go so far as the text solace in the fact that that in a sense that you will always exist because you will always be at the moments of space and time that you have occupied throughout your life well actually that's probably the only way in which you can take solace because all the rest right it's almost children's stories yeah I mean of course it's something that you come by yourself you arrive at this conclusion which is totally not objective and is part of your personal history by yourself but it was interesting to see that for instance Kurt Vonnegut had exactly the same thing I said no I mean the only thing that really makes you not fear what will happen or your own is that every instant is eternal instances exactly as each point in space it's not the space disappears it will always be there yeah the idea that something is irretrievable maybe it's an accident and we go back again to order the initial conditions in which we started absolutely foreign of time I hope that you have appreciated the subtlety and the richness of this quality of the world that we experience all the time thanks so much for watching
