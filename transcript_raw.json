      "corpus": "hey guys Chris fix here and today I'm going to show you the entire process of how to replace a hybrid battery and in this case we're going to be working on my generation 3 Prius so this video will cover from 2010 to 2015 and this is my 2013 Prius I just purchased I found it on Auto Tempest for 2 700 because well it has a bad Hybrid battery and hopefully when we're done with this the car will be fixed it'll be worth about eight thousand dollars leaving us room for a healthy profit now these Generation 3 Priuses are getting up there in age and mileage and that's causing these batteries to fail and when they do fail that is very expensive and just to give you an idea I got a quote from a local dealership to replace the Hybrid battery and it would cost forty six hundred dollars so we're talking a lot of money here so instead we're gonna be installing an aftermarket battery pack from electron Automotive this is about twenty two hundred dollars saving us a thousand dollars over OEM plus we're gonna be doing this with common hand tools ourselves saving us a thousand dollars in labor so over two thousand dollars saved by doing this ourselves and the best thing is this is an upgraded battery pack so this battery pack has more power than OEM and also when you're using the regenerative braking this charges up quicker plus we have a three year 45 000 mile warranty versus the OEM one year 12 000 mile warranty now the most important thing when getting an aftermarket battery pack is making sure you get a high quality one and I've actually used this company before check this out this right here is the Prius I replaced the Hybrid battery on over four years ago I made a video on it's a Gen 2 Prius so 2004 to 2009 just in case you guys had this year Prius I'll put a link in the description to that video below and the reason why I asked the owner to bring the car by real quick is because the proof is in the pudding this is a daily driver for over four years no Hybrid battery issues it's been fixed and this car is a great example of that so I've used this company before with good results and they have a full service shop out in California which is why I'm comfortable recommending them to you guys so I want to thank them for supporting the video and making these high quality battery packs that don't break the bank for a bunch of different hybrid cars that way we could fix these cars instead of junking them and I'm going to show you how to do that right now so all these tools and products I use in this video will be linked down in the description that way you could easily find it let's grab our safety glasses and get them on and let's go get started now before you go buy an expensive battery pack let me show you real quick how to tell if your battery is bad now the good thing about the Prius is it clearly lets you know that the battery is bad so if we go to starter up and take a look at the dashboard you can see it comes up right away to check the hybrid system additionally you'll notice that the fuel economy will go down right now I'm only getting about 30 miles a gallon but with the new battery I bet we could get over 60. and we'll test out that bet at the end of the video and finally the best for sure way to know that you have a bad battery is to plug in an OBD2 scanner like this that way we could scan the computer so under the steering wheel you could plug in the scanner into this port right here and since this car is already turned on just open up the app on the phone and scan the codes and here are the results of the skin if we look down at the permanent codes we have p0880 that says to replace the Hybrid battery p3011 saying block one is weak and p3013 saying block 3 is weak so if you see codes like this you could be pretty confident that your battery needs to be replaced so now we know for sure the Hybrid battery is bad let's shut the engine off and let's replace it now the Hybrid battery is located in the rear of the car so we're going to be working out of the trunk so let's pop that open and just to give you an idea the Hybrid battery is located right about here so let me show you how to easily get to it first let's remove the trunk liner then we can remove the floor lid followed by the cargo tray and just like that you could already see our Hybrid battery right here now we do have to remove a couple of other things to get to the full battery but before we do anything else once I could see this orange plug this is the safety plug I like to remove it so all you have to do to remove it pull that out turn the lever and that comes right out just like that this safety plug kills the voltage when it's removed so now the battery is safe to work on that's why I like to remove it right away so with that removed now let's go and disconnect the 12 volt battery so pop this tray out as well as this little side panel to get access to the battery now I'm using a 10 millimeter wrench to loosen up the negative cable and a ratcheting wrench works great here and with this loose we could disconnect it from the battery and tuck it away so it won't touch the negative terminal so with our battery disconnected now we can come to the other side and remove these plastic trim pieces so remove the lid and then there's a plastic nut you could unscrew by hand and then this tray comes right out with that now let's head over to the back seats and remove the Privacy shade this just pops out good and then fold down both rear seats and that quickly we almost have access to our battery there are only two pieces left that we need to remove we have this interior piece right here which will get our fingers under and pop up but before we do that there is a hidden bolt right about here I'll show you how to get that out and then we have our side interior piece which we also want to remove so we could get to the side of the battery so let's get this top piece off first and to do that come around to the passenger side here pop that door open and let me show you where that hidden bolt is right here and this is a 10 millimeter bolt so let's break this loose and then loosen it the rest of the way by hand good so now with our rear bolt removed we could come back around to the rear of the car and we could pop this plastic trim piece out now the trick here is to get your fingers under the plastic and you want one good strong pull just like that perfect so now you can clearly see the battery and you can also see why I'm saying we should remove this side panel here it gets in the way so to remove this side panel we're going to sneak around to the passenger side and we need to remove this right here and to do that it's going to be hard to see but you have to press press down on this seat cushion and there is a bolt down there that you need to remove now this is a 12 millimeter so get a socket on there with an extension break it loose and carefully remove it the rest of the way so you don't drop it behind the seat good so now what we're going to do to remove this piece right here with the vent we're going to lift upwards like this and then we're going to pull this part at the top outwards like that and this comes right out so with the trim piece removed you can see we have a filter right here this is very important if you have a Prius check to see if you have this filter not every Prius has this filter and if you don't all this stuff that got caught up here will end up going into your electric fan and it can cause your battery to overheat if your battery overheats it could go bad that's expensive this is cheap so if you have a Prius even if your battery's not bad make sure you check and see if you have a filter they didn't all come with filters if you don't have a filter I'll put a link in the description to where you could find one it's inexpensive and can save you a ton of money plus you don't want your battery getting hot and if you do have a filter already it's worth checking to make sure it's not clogged up like this one that could also cause your battery to run hot so let's clean it now on the side of the filter is a little tab so just pull the housing off the tab and then you could carefully pry the filter out making sure you don't shake the the dust off the filter now to clean the filter just use some running water it would actually be better if I flip this around and hit it from the other side and now you can see all the dust is coming right off no problem and once this is clean just give it a good shake to get all the water off and we're ready to install our clean filter so just reinstall it the same way it came out and remember on the side of the housing there is a hole just get that filter tab into the hole and now the clean filter is installed beautiful so with that filter nice and clean we could come around to the back and now we could remove our side trim piece and to get that off first we need to pop off this trim piece so with two hands give it one big pull beautiful and now we can remove our side panel and there are four Fasteners holding this in we have one right down here we have one right there we have one at the seat belt and we have one right there so let's get those removed so let's start at the tie down right here and loosen this 10 millimeter bolt and remove it the rest of the way by hand then right above that is the cargo net tie down which could be removed with a Phillips head screwdriver and and with that removed let's remove the Fastener over here under the seat belt and just get a small flathead screwdriver into the hole here and pry it out like so and now this just comes right out and finally the last Fastener is this tie down right here so break this 10 millimeter bolt loose good and then we can loosen it up the rest of the way and remove it beautiful and with all four Fasteners removed now we can pop this panel out and we're going to start popping it out from this side right here so now we just have to peel back this weather stripping and just set it off to the side and that leaves us a little Gap here we could work our fingers behind you just want to get your finger right on the plastic clip and pop it out so that's the plastic clip right there I was telling you to get your fingers on so you're pulling on the actual plastic and not on this material because you could rip it off you could actually see the glue from another clip that's supposed to be right there somebody pulled on this and ripped that clip off I actually saw that clip earlier and you can see somebody already has been in here I also noticed on the battery there is a sticker or decal or something or tape whatever this is that's not normally there from the factory so I think somebody might have been inside this battery already I'm not concerned because we're replacing all the internals so we're gonna have basically a brand new battery with new cells but I'm curious to see what's inside so let's finish up removing the side panel now just work your way along the top of this panel popping it out as you go for the seat belt you can lift this up and the seat belt slides right out and now this panel could come out completely and with that removed now we have plenty of room to get to the battery and disconnect it but before we remove the battery I want to epoxy this plastic piece back onto our interior trim piece that way we give our epoxy time to cure and by the time we have to install this it'll be good to go so I'm using a strong two-part epoxy and always use a non-porous surface to mix this in then you just push out the amount you need like that and mix it together real quick until it's one uniform color which takes about 10 seconds at most now we want to get this on here right away because this hardens pretty quickly so work the epoxy into the material and spread it out like so and you can make out the original orientation of the clip on the panel so let me get this in the same position and then push it into place and finally clamp this down to hold its height against the material for a good strong cure so as we let that cure let's go back over to the car and disconnect the high Hybrid battery and we'll start right on this side so let's remove this black vent and to do that we need to remove this clip right here so get your panel clip pliers and work it under the clip and then pry up until it pops out good and now we can remove the vent from the battery next we have this white plastic piece that needs to be removed and there's a white clip right here to push the plastic off the clip and then there's another clip down here so just give this a good yank and it'll come right off good so now we have five 10 millimeter nuts that we need to remove from this cover so let's remove these two nuts right here and then the last three are deep in here so you're going to need to use an extension to loosen them and to remove the nut all the way down here a stick magnet makes this really easy so loosen the nut on the other side and use the stick magnet to easily remove it and finally there's one last nut right here so let's remove that and all that's left is this right here and this orange Fastener is specially designed to keep you safe it cannot be removed without a special tool I'll show you that in a second the reason being is underneath this cover are exposed wires so they don't want you opening up this cover without your safety plug removed remember this is what we removed in the beginning of the video that way it kills all the voltage to the battery and if you look at the end of the safety plug right there you can see there's a peg well that Peg fits right into that hole that way we can remove the safety Fastener so you can see it fits in just like that then you give it about a quarter of a turn and it pops open and then you can remove that fastener so that's a really good design to make sure that the safety plug is removed before you remove this cover and now's probably a good time for me to explain how I remember where to put all these different Fasteners the nuts the bolts when I go to reinstall them because there's a bunch this is just the beginning we already have a bunch well the easiest way is to get a Ziploc bag with a note card in it and just label everything you can see I have five 10 millimeter nuts and one orange Fastener and then I'll put it right in this bag and then now I know for sure when I go to reinstall everything where this goes it just makes the whole process foolproof so now we can remove our cover and that gives us access to our battery junction box which is all the electronics for our battery and the only thing that we need to touch in here right now are these two wires so these two wires take the high voltage from our battery and bring it to the inverter which is in the engine bay and then that powers the electric motor now normally these two wires have a lot of voltage going through them but that's only when the car is on and when our safety plug is plugged in you can see with the safety plug removed it opens the circuit here so there's no voltage flowing through any of this so this is a very safe design and just in case you want a little bit of extra peace of mind to make sure there's no voltage going through these wires before you touch them you could grab your multimeter and you could take your negative lead right here touch it to the negative side you take your positive lead right here touch it to the positive side and you can see there are no volts at all running through this system so we are safe to disconnect these two wires so break both of these 10 millimeter nuts loose with the ratchet then we can remove both of these the rest of the way by hand and then we could remove the wires and don't worry about the ends here they could touch metal without any problems since there's no power to them so tuck them out of the way like that and then get these two nuts back on the studs that way we don't lose them so with our high voltage wires disconnected and tucked off to the side next we want to remove this black duct work that connects to our fan here that way it's easier to remove the battery there's also a couple wires that go over here that we need to pop off and set off to the side and then we have some wires with pigtails that we could disconnect and then we're able to remove our battery now to remove this ducting you need to pop off this clip right here so get in there and pry it apart and then this comes right out like that next we have two retaining Clips right here so let's pop these out and this just holds the wiring to the case and the next clip right here has a little tab that you pry outwards and then that clip could slide right off like that and finally there's one more clip down here holding in this wire and the easiest way to remove this is to grab a needle nose pliers and just squeeze the two ends of the clip and that makes it pop out a lot easier so with these wires removed from the case now let's disconnect them from the connectors and all you need to do is press in this little Tab and pull it right out same with the connector here and this last connector here good so with those wires removed all that's holding this battery in are six bolts and we could quickly remove them there's two in the front there's one right there and there's one right there there's two in this corner and then there's two in that corner so let's get these bolts removed and get this battery out so all these are 12 millimeter bolts and they're in there pretty good so you're gonna need a little more leverage there we go so break it loose and then you could remove it the rest of the way by hand then the next bolt is right here so break that loose and now we can remove it the rest of the way by hand now the next two bolts are in the back corner here and these are the two bolts we need to remove and if you look here this one also holds the rear seat down and the bolt is different than that one so just keep that in mind for when we go and reinstall these later on and again these are both 12 millimeter bolts so remove them all the way and you can see the shorter one is the one that goes into the back seat bracket right down here so with these two bolts removed let's come over to the other corner and get these last two bolts removed again both of these are 12 millimeter and an extension makes it easier to get down here and to remove them a stick magnet works wonders because there is a lot of room to get your hands down here now we have our last bolt right here let's get that bolt out good now the battery is completely disconnected so let's remove it and I'm going to show you how to do this with just one person first let's get all six of those bolts we just removed and put them in a labeled bag I'm calling these the battery hold down bolts good and a little trick is to put some cardboard down that way it's easy to slide the battery out so I'll start on the fan side of the battery and pull it out a little bit then go to the other side and pull it out a little more now if you have a friend around this is where they could help you lift this 90 pound battery but as you can see you could do this on your own if you really need to all right so with our old battery removed now we just need to remove this cover under here are all the old cells that will pull out and replace with our nice brand new cells once the new cells go back in we'll wire it back up we'll put the cover back on and we could get this installed now real quick I do want to mention they sell this entire battery pack with brand new cells pre-installed that way you don't have to open it up and replace the cells yourself it does cost more money about 500 more but it is an option just in case you're uncomfortable with digging into the battery and swapping out the cells now it's not difficult to do I'm about to show you how to do it right now so you can save yourself that 500 bucks so there are four nuts on this side of the case that need to be removed all these are 10 millimeter nuts so remove them completely now real quick something that I noticed that I want to mention right here is a hole and in this hole should be one of these orange safety Fasteners but in this case it isn't because I think somebody's been in this battery and they forgot to reinstall it so in your battery if it hasn't been touched you will find one of these safety Fasteners right here you already know how to remove this so just pop it out good good and with those four nuts removed now we can move to the other side of the battery and remove the other four nuts so that's one that's two three and four and now we can remove the cover okay so with the cover removed you can actually see each individual cell that makes up the entire Hybrid battery that's pretty cool now what we're gonna do next is remove the bus bars so there's one on this side and there is one on this side so let me show you how to get those off so just grab a small flathead screwdriver and just pry it at the top like that and it should come right off so work your way down the battery and remove all the covers so with the covers removed you can see each individual nut that holds the bus bar onto each individual battery cell and we have to remove all those and if you have power tools Now's the Time to use them because you could buzz off all these nuts really quickly with this but I know not everybody has power tools so I'm going to be using good old common hand tools to show you you could get it done with just this so let's remove all 28 eight millimeter nuts and again if you have power tools use them because it'll make this job go much quicker but as you can see you can still get this job done with just a ratchet no problem so with all the nuts removed you can put them in your used nut and bolt jar because this kit comes with brand new bolts that fit into the new batteries so now let's pull the the orange bus bars off the battery so the bus bar is completely removed from this side of the battery we could just let that sit like that for now we're going to remove that completely in a second but first let's remove the other bus bar real quick so pry off all the bus bar covers expose the nuts and again remove all 28 eight millimeter nuts and just to give you an idea it does take about seven minutes to do this by hand and only about a minute to do it with power tools off camera I timed it because I was curious so now we can remove the bus bars and you can see this right here this is the wiring for the safety plug so just pop it out and we're going to reuse this on the new batteries so with the bus bars removed from both sides of the battery now we could take our safety plug wiring the one that went right over here we could just tuck this off to the side because we're going to keep that connected and then we want to take our old bus bar wiring this one and we're going to disconnect it from these two spots right here so just use a small flathead screwdriver to push the tab in and pull the wire straight out same for the other one now we can open up the white wire holder and remove both of the orange wires and then finally we need to disconnect the orange connector at the bottom here so depress the tab and pull it out perfect and just like that we've removed our high voltage bus bars so make sure you say this because there's a wire on here we're going to have to reinstall with the new battery now the next thing we need to do is remove the temperature sensor for the battery see it connects into here and it goes up here there is one right there there is another one right there and the final one is right there and to remove the sensor just pinch each side inwards and it comes right out now let's pop off the white wire holder and save this because we're going to use these later and then get the middle temperature sensor out along with the other wire holder and finally the last temperature sensor could be removed again with its wire holder now right here the harness is held in so pop this out and then this top wiring harness is in the way of the bottom one which we need to remove so let's remove the top one to get easier access and now we can get the temperature sensor harness disconnected like so and then there's one more temperature sensor down here in the case so pop it out with a pliers good and now the whole temperature sensor harness could be removed and with that we have removed everything from our battery so now we can remove this battery pack from our case and to do that we need to flip this case over and remember this is a 90 pound battery so carefully flip this also the edge is pretty sharp right here so be careful and just flip this over completely like this good so with our case flipped over now we need to remove this bracket right here which is covering the bolts that hold the battery in so remove all eight Fasteners holding this bracket in and then we could remove the bracket beautiful so now you can see we have access to all 14 bolts on this side as well as the 14 bolts on the other side which holds our battery pack to the case so let's remove those so first grab a ratchet and a socket and you want to crack each bolt loose because they're pretty tight on here and I'll say it again if you have power tools use them so it's quicker but I do have a trick to speed things along once you crack all these loose grab your Phillips head screwdriver and this will quickly loosen them the rest of the way so unscrew all the bolts on this side and don't lose them because we're going to need these to install into the new batteries so with all the bolts on this side removed now let's go to the other side of the battery and remove these bolts so quickly unscrew these bolts as well and now we can pull the battery case off the battery so with our battery removed now what we're going to do is slide all these old cells out of this framework here and slide in our new cells so let's get started a trick here is to use a piece of wood to elevate this battery pack and now we want to crack these 12 millimeter bolts loose back here and these are usually a little tight there we go so crack all four of these bolts loose and then remove the bolts so we could take the end cap off good so real quick let me show you the difference between the new cylindrical cells and the old Prismatic cells so this Prismatic cell technology is from the early 2000s and the cylindrical cell technology is current this is what we're using now the good thing about the cylindrical cells is you could see the air gap in here because it's a cylinder there is a large air gap and that allows it to cool better compared to this right here where the air gaps are smaller now heat is the number one killer battery so if you could keep a battery cooler it's going to last longer which is a big benefit the other benefit is these cylindrical cells charge quicker with regenerative braking compared to the OEM which is a nice upgrade so now remove all the old cells and the easiest way to do this is to slide them out of the bracket now we could take all the old cells and put them in a box to ship them back so we could get our core charge back next the kit comes with four strands of protective wire loom and this is included so that you could install this over each of the metal bars like this the reason why you want to do this is to insulate these metal bars that way it doesn't cause any shorts just in case there's chafing somewhere now at the end of the wire loom it's a little sloppy so grabs some electrical tape and tape up the ends you could also use heat shrink but tape works fine so just get a couple of wraps around the end of the Loom and now the end looks good and won't come apart alright so we have our wire loom protector on all four of these posts they're all nicely taped up and we are good to go here so let's go and install our brand new battery pack now this battery pack is labeled from one all the way to 14. we want to make sure that we keep it in that order because these batteries are matched and balanced with each other to give you the best possible battery life so with that said let's get these installed so now we want to make sure we Orient our bracket properly you can see how we have two metal rods here these are the wide ones they're spread apart we want the wider ones on the bottom because it's a nice big base and don't forget to slide your wood under here that way it's easier to slide the batteries in and easier to get that end piece on alright so we're going to start with battery one two and three and make sure you don't bang these around or drop them because you can damage the batteries but get them in here and slide them to the end next we have batteries four five six and seven then we we have batteries 8 9 10 and 11 and finally we have 12 13 and 14. okay so our cells are installed we just want to make sure they go from one all the way up to 14 in order we also want to make sure it's centered so you can see here's the two metal rods we have the center line here it's even through the whole battery pack and it is and then finally you just want to make sure the end here is flush so all the cells are flush against each other and they are so we're good to go so the rib side goes up against the battery and hand tighten all four of these bolts to sandwich the batteries together and we want to torque each one of these down to 23 foot pounds that's what the battery cells locked together let's flip this over so the bolt holes on the batteries face up and then we can get the battery case and get that on top and you can see right here is the black Air Dam that goes on the open end of the case and the side without the black Air Dam goes on the computer side of the case that way you know it's oriented correctly okay so with our case on our battery we just want to make sure that these bolt holes in the battery line up with the holes in the case and you can see they do if they don't line up perfectly don't worry you could shift the case around to get them to line up you just want to be able to thread in a bolt and then the rest of this will line up as you thread in each bolt so this side looks good and if we take a look at the other side that looks good as well so we're ready to install this and thread in all those bolts now real quick organization is key it takes a few extra minutes if you want to do this job without any problems at all just take some baggies and write down where everything goes and keep it in order so you can't forget that way when you go to reinstall everything you're not trying to figure out which nut or bolt goes where it's all right here so we have our case two battery bolts all 28 of them so let's get them installed now I'm going to quickly speed through tightening down each of these bolts because we don't need to waste time here but just make sure you hand tighten them all like so so with these bolts hand tightened don't torque them down yet let's come to the other side and let's get these bolts in and this side we want to hand tighten as well and now we want to get our torque wrench and set it to 54 inch pounds not foot pounds inch pounds so torque all these down making sure you don't miss any and also make sure again it's 54 inch pounds not foot pounds cost if you use foot pounds it will strip these threads right out and that'll damage the battery with all the bolts torqued down now we can get the bracket on here and I have this baggie so I can stay organized and not forget where any of the Fasteners go and just get these hand tightened in there for now and then we could torque them down to 66 inch pounds good and now we can flip this back over so we could finish up the install and I cannot wait to get this back in the car so next what we want to do is connect our battery in series so each of these cells is about 15.7 volts but when we connect them all together it's around 220 volts and we'll do that using the included brand new bus bars and they go right up against the battery both on this side and on the other side so just get the bus bar in place and screw in the new bolts that came with the kit now when installing the bus bars you don't want to tighten down the bolts all the way just yet because we're going to need to install a wire onto each of these in a second and right here we don't need a bus bar because this is where the safety switch wires are going to attach and complete the circuit but we do need to get this last bus bar in right here good and with all those bus bars installed now we could come around to the other side and install these now both of these Ends don't get bus bars because they get the orange wires when we're done so just connect the bus bars to all the other batteries like so so with all the bus bars loose but installed the reason why we kept them loose is because we need to install our voltage acquisition wires which are these right here they connect to each of these bus bars that way the computer will know if the battery's depleted if it's fully charged if any of these cells are bad and stuff like that so this wiring harness plugs right into the computer down at that orange plug so let's unbundle it and get the harness in The Wire holder on the bottom and then just press it into the computer until it clicks good now there are two main wires here a shorter one and a longer one the shorter one stays on this side which is closer and the longer one wraps around the other side of the battery so for the voltage acquisition wire that we're running along the far side of the battery we don't want to just run it like this because right here is a bad chafing point that over time could cause issues against this metal bracket so make sure you run this wire through the white wire loom protector then we could tuck it right behind the computer right here and run it around the corner to the other side of the battery now since we're working in this battery junction box area grab the small orange wire that we removed before and let's plug this in there's two spots to plug in Orange wires the shorter wire goes here they can't fit into the wrong one so you can't mess this up and then let's put it in this white wire holder and this wire goes right to this first cell right here now the other orange wire is still connected to our orange bus bars we never disconnected it so you can see it right down here just pry this off and then this comes off like that and then we could separate it keep our wire here and get this and send it back with the core so let's connect this wire right here and then we can run it right through this wire holder and close that up good so with both of our orange wires connected you can see the short one runs right to our first battery right there and our long one runs all the way back to the last battery right there so let's get this all wired up so get your last acquisition wire on the bolt and then bolt up the orange wire to the last battery like so and we'll torque this down in a second same for the next wire get it on the bolt and snug it up and notice how I'm holding the wire in a downward Direction so it doesn't turn as I tighten keeping this pointed down will help keep everything nice and neat and organized so tighten down one acquisition wire for each bus bar and I'm putting them on the right side of the bus bar but you could put them on either side just make sure you keep it consistent and also make sure it's only one wire per bus bar and finally we have our last blue one right here that goes on the last orange wire good and now we can torque each of these down to 54 inch pounds then let's get the new bus bar covers that come with the kit and install them but first let's tuck the acquisition wire harness into the little Channel under the bus bars so it's neat and organized and the orange wire has its own channel right here as well that we could push it into then we can get the bus bar covers on starting with the skinny one for the end here and then the wider ones go on the rest of these and they just snap into the battery like this so get all the bus bar covers on and check it out this came out awesome everything is wired up it's covered with the bus bar covers and our wires are neat and organized so we're done on this side let's flip over to the other side and finish wiring this battery up so do the same thing on this side each wire end goes on one of the bus bars and in this case I'm using the left side just remember to keep it consistent and now for the safety switch wiring just grab this plastic cover and pop it off and now the two wires line up to the batteries like this so tighten down the orange wire to the right side and then get that acquisition wire on the left side and then tighten that one down as well and that's all there is to wiring our safety switch so now we're good to go here and now we can torque down all the bus bar bolts to 54 inch pounds and then we can get the bus bar covers on each of these and just make sure they all snap in place and just like that we are done wiring in our brand new battery pack now all that's left is to install our temperature sensors which go on the top and then after that we put the case on and get this battery back in the car and test it out so our temperature sensors go on battery number two number eight and number 13. and this is what a sensor looks like there's a little spring here so bend that inwards that way when you push it on the battery it snaps in place like that now get the other two sensors on good and then you want to grab the white wire holders from your old temperature sensor harness and these clip right onto the metal Rail and this will hold the sensor wires in place that way it stays organized so let's get the other two clips in place and run the wires through it so the wiring is neat and organized like that good so now there's one last temperature sensor that needs to go all the way down in that hole there so get it down there and push it in until it snaps in place now let's connect the white temperature sensor connector to the bottom spot on the computer and then push the wiring harness into the holder up here then finally let's connect the other connector we removed to make it easier to get to the bottom one good now our case could go back on and then get your battery case baggy that way we don't forget to tighten anything and there are four nuts on this side that get torqued to 66 inch pounds and I picked up a spare safety Fastener from the junkyard because mine was missing from the case and that snaps right in there so this side is done let's real quickly come around to the other side and tighten the other side down again these four nuts get torqued to 66 inch pounds and with the cover bolted down we are ready to install our brand new battery in our car real quick I do want to mention check your fan to make sure it isn't covered in Dust In this case we have a filter you guys saw we cleaned that filter so we don't have any dust in here but it's worth checking because if you don't have a filter and this gets clogged up you're going to ruin your brand new battery because it won't cool down and just so you get an idea of what a fan looks like that's clogged up I grabbed this fan from a Prius in the junkyard that didn't have a filter and check this out you see how it's all clogged in there that is pretty bad so you need to make sure you clean that out I mean just look at this this is crazy and this right here is why your battery might overheat not good it's also why a filter is pretty important so you need to make sure you clean this out now when you're cleaning this out it's very important do not use compressed air where this spins because if you let this fan spin it will damage the motor you also don't want to use water you could actually do a core exchange with the company that sells this battery and they'll send you out a cleaned one if you want or if you want just hold the fan in place and then hit it with air to clean it out or use a vacuum something like that just don't let it spin and don't get water in it okay so let's carefully get our brand new very heavy battery into the Prius making sure we don't damage anything and since I'm doing this myself just walk the battery back and forth along the cardboard to get it in place that way we could bolt it up and once in place remove the cardboard pieces then we can line up the battery bolt hole get some medium strength red Locker on the bolt and hand tighten it into place and do the same thing for the other bolt as well so with those two bolts hand tightened we have two more bolts in that corner and two more bolts in this corner and remember the shorter bolt goes into the back here with a rear seat bracket is and the longer bolt goes into the other bolt hole and just hand tighten these down now let's move over to the other side and get these two bolts in again shorter bolt goes to the seat bracket and just hand tighten both of these bolts down now we can tighten down all six of these bolts to 14 foot pounds so with everything torqued down now we could go to the battery junction box and we want to grab the wires that go to the inverter and we'll attach these wires then we'll attach the wires down here we'll get the lid on our junction box and then we'll test this out so remove the two nuts we threaded on here so we wouldn't lose them then we could get the inverter wires on the posts and get those nuts hand tightened on there and torque them down to 80 inch pounds good now let's come down here and plug in these three connectors so just push them in until you hear a nice click next let's get the electronics cover back on and grab your baggie with all the fasteners for this now we can hand tighten all five of these nuts securing the cover to the battery and torque them all down to 66 inch pounds and finally let's get the safety Fastener in and now we're done okay so before we go any further and start installing interior pieces and Vents and stuff like that our battery is good to go we have the cover on here we have our safety Fasteners in we're safe to try this out so let's get our safety plug in and it just pushes in then you close the lever and push it all the way to the side until it snaps in place and one thing I want you to keep in mind make sure that you actually push that in all the way so the unlock disappears otherwise this won't work so that needs to be closed like that so with that safety plug in I also connected the negative terminal on the battery let's go try this out all right moment of truth did we fix this car so I have my foot on the brake I'm gonna hit that start button and when I do that you're going to hear two distinctive clicks those are the relays turning the battery on and we should see no error messages up on the dashboard so let's give it a try beautiful the engine just started there are no check engine lights or anything on the dash which is good and since the engine's running you can see it's charging up the battery which is great so the engine just shut off on its own meaning the battery is charged up enough for right now so I'm gonna shut the engine and we know everything is working right we didn't have any warning lights on the dash so let's go install the rest of the Interior now back at the battery technically we don't have to remove this if we don't want but I always like to be safe so anytime I'm working around the battery it's worth it takes two seconds to do pull it out and you're good to go now let's go get some of the vents installed and then get our side panel installed and we'll be done so first get the wire harness Clips pushed back into the battery like so then let's add that fan filter in vent and push that clip into the fan so it holds it in place then we could add our white cover and push it into this clip right here and then push it down right here to snap it into the battery next let's add this vent to the top of the battery and finally with all the vents and everything installed now let's get our side panel installed and if you remember we did epoxy that plastic clip on the back here so let's take our clamps off and our clip is good to go that's glued on there so we can install this so just push in at the top of the panel so it clicks in and work your way around the panel hitting it in place like so and finally we have our last baggie of fasteners for the interior now we have four Fasteners holding this in we have the silver tie down we have the plastic piece we have that black tie down and then we have another silver tie down there so let's get this first silver tie down in and snug it up and then let's get this black tie down in then under the seat belt push that plastic clip in and finally let's get that last silver tie down snugged up beautiful so with our side panel installed now let's come around to the passenger side here and let's get our air vent cover installed so get the vent in place like this and push downwards so it clicks in so now we need to install this black 12 millimeter bolt but the problem is going to be if we just put it in our socket like this the angle we have to install it at it could fall out and remember this bolt is buried deep behind the seat if it falls out down here it's going to be a pain to get back so a little trick is to get some black tape and just put it over the end of the socket like that just want to tape the end so it's pretty much closed off and then you take your bolt and you push the bolt in as far as you can get it just like that now the bolt is in there good because the clearance is so tight then we could carefully get the bolt in the hole and tighten it down all the way perfect so with our vent cover installed now let's get this floor tray back on the battery so get the floor tray lined up and push it down to make sure it's in place and you just want to hit around the tray that way all the clips snap in so with this secure don't forget there is a hidden bolt that we need to tighten down right about here so get the bolt tightened down then let's get both seats back up and get the Privacy cover back in and we can't forget about the safety plug so let's get this in so that just pushes in and make sure that you can't see that unlock text now snug up the negative battery cable and make sure it's tight then let's get this axis cover back on and it just snaps into place then we have this plastic trim piece that gets pushed in followed by this bucket in the corner here and it's lid then the battery cover in the other corner and then the big trunk Storage Tray followed by our floor lid and finally the trunk liner and just like that we are done let's go for a quick test drive and see what kind of fuel economy we get okay so for the test drive I'm taking a trip down to the beach and I've been trying to maximize fuel economy so I'm coasting to all the red lights and stop signs I'm using my brake regen as much as possible I'm going full electric mode as much as I can as well and that's actually what I'm doing right now this trip to the beach is a little over 20 miles with lots of elevation change we have highway driving we have City driving so it's a good mixture to put this battery to the test and this car is performing amazing the ride is smooth there's plenty of power that's slipping in the transmission that we felt well that's completely gone also you remember when the engine shut off it used to vibrate well it doesn't do that anymore it's nice and smooth so the new battery fixed all those problems and check this out you're not gonna believe this we got just under 70 miles a gallon for our trip to the beach which is incredible now this is definitely not normal results but typically expect to get between 40 and 50 miles a gallon for a Prius also I just scanned the computer and we have no more trouble codes so we have officially fixed this hybrid alright and that's everything you need to know on how to replace a hybrid battery in a generation 3 Prius we got this car for twenty seven hundred dollars we spent twenty two hundred dollars with the Hybrid battery which is brand new and we put about a hundred dollars in hubcaps and cleaning supplies and stuff like that into the car so for five grand we have a car that's worth at least three or four thousand dollars more we could easily get eight grand for this if we find the right buyer maybe even nine thousand dollars and they'll have an amazing car that gets great fuel economy it runs and drives great and it looks spectacular just look at this car so

      "corpus": "which is quickest in a drag race the new BMW M3 touring or an Audi RS4 to find out I'm going to drag race them up this Runway over the quarter mile two fast estate cars what will happen let me tell you about this Audi it's got a 2.9 liter twin turbo V6 that puts out 450 horsepower and 600 newton meters of torque driving four wheels via Quattro all-wheel drive and an 8-speed automatic gearbox with launch control it weighs in at just under 1.8 tons and it costs 70 000 pounds which makes it seem like a bit of a bargain compared to the BMW which costs from 85 000 pounds anyway let's speak to its driver hi Annie how are you hi Matt I'm really good and this car is lovely it's so nice love the look of it love the paint on it love the seats although the interior is so ready I think it's really nice no I think the red works with the black everywhere ah just reminds me of the opponent looks from the 1980s no anyway tell me the stats on your car he doesn't know them why didn't you give me a heads up three liter yes it's 500 ish brake horsepower yeah 510 what about talk yes 650 thank God 650 yeah you've got four wheel drive and an automatic gearbox how many gears has the gearbox got seven or eight seven no it's eight I'm afraid and the weight I don't think it's gonna be that heavy 1.7 no this one's about 1.7 yours it's actually almost 1.9 tons it's quite heavy but I am in it that's why it's nothing to do with here honestly it for some reason it's quite a heavy car price I've already said the price but you see if you can guess uh what would I pay for this car 100 Grand that one with options is get on for 100 grand yeah you're right but the starting price is 85 000 pounds for an M3 you must have had an M3 in your time right how much do you pay for your M3 back in the day well I see outside the E46 73 schnitzel of everything all single dancing I think back then that might have been only about 40 or 50 Grand nice anyway if you like this kind of drag

the stats of these cars side by side and just peruse them at your own Leisure you know for that kind of like geeky comparison then just pause the video now right before we drag race let's do the customer Cola sound check so here we go rubbish rubbish rubbish crap [Applause] oh wow no stop limit huh that sounds all right that sounds pretty good actually BMW Fanboys are creaming themselves right now they love a bit of it don't they right they're gonna love the drag race even more when you see what happens if you're thinking about selling your car you can do it the easy way through Car mounts dead simple right all you have to do is upload some photos give a brief description then dealers from all across the country will bid on your car in an auction then you just pick the highest bid up they'll come to your house at the car way and put the money in your account it is so easy if you want to do that now check out the service click on the pop-out band up there for the link in the description below if you want to do it a later date I'll find out more about it just simply Google help me call out and we will help you sell your car not help me Google Google help me Carla we will she doesn't understand me buy sell car wow three oh Quattro traction off the line come on baby oh why's got a better start than me [Music] there he goes buggery I'm gonna lie my launch is a lot better than yours to be for it launched and everything was on the dash so yeah I don't know I'm not sure yeah I don't know I thought you'd have done better now off the line but Quattro this just dug in man catapulted me off the line I thought oh my head here but then that just breathes past really I don't even know if it breezed past it yeah it beat you I to be honest thought I'd beat you by a lot more do you want to have another go see if you can beat me by more yeah that'd be quite nice I know let's do best two out of three ah two out three what did try three right always two out of three that's how we do I always bet off the line that time that's better oh that's better [Music] what color two car limbs three car limbs our launcher is the same then bang on wasn't it that car is just quicker isn't it yeah that was better that that felt more like it and what's amazing is that it's carrying more weight as well it's almost 200 kilos heavier than this which gives me an idea all right Annie so what I've done is given you a weight penalty you know what they're doing racing to race me but you've got a capacity oh come on [Music] oh no luckily you don't weigh too much Bev [Applause] you did me you and your passenger you happy very happy mate because obviously I'm not the the slimmest of people plus bath plus the weight of this car and we're still beating you mate what are you gonna do and that might give you more of a chance so the car on its own would be better than with me driving it is that what you're saying exactly that I'm making pay for that all right and Yani you now have two passengers and we're still gonna have the same result oh it's a good launch come on off [Music] got him again is right [Applause] got him again bring on the next passenger mat come on oh you're right have you got any more friends I've got more friends and I've got more fans just I get this right is that three nil to me now yeah it's not finished yet though all right and Yani now you've got three friends hold on Matt his phone's ringing mate what do you reckon's gonna happen now same result again mate are you ready I'm ready two one come on come on oh no [Applause] oh no come on ah yes I think you just beat me on the line Matt are we putting someone else in mate we could be here all day and you got one more friend because you got one more space I think you need to fill it I've got one more space and mate if I beat you now that is a full-blown Clean Sweep I'm going home can a BMW M3 with five people in it beat an Audi RS4 with just the driver that's right it's very tight in here Matt I'm not gonna lie mate they're all sitting all over on top of each other now in here it's very cozy yeah but it's gonna be humiliating if you still win three two good oh come on yes come on oh we got too much away [Applause] oh no we've done too well finally oh dear oh dear oh dear I took it too far didn't I I just went that one extra person too far yes you did so anyway um did I say the only race that matters is the last race because that's the one that we do the scoring on okay bye so then what exactly happened well the Audi won completing the standing quarter mile in 12.0 seconds the BMW came last with a time of 12.1 seconds with just the driver on board the BMW actually took 11.6 seconds to do the stunning quarter mile all right now we have a rolling race from 50 miles an hour the cars are in just like their normal comfy automatic setting automatically over the gearbox I'm going to count it in the first reach the half mile win so here we go three two one go oh it's kicked out quicker than his but now he's going it's not bad in standard this really shows you how much more powerful that BMW is it's just walking away from me now that's quick inefficiency in it it's not a massive difference I'm not sure if it's worth 15 000 pounds which that costs more than this but it is a difference isn't it what do you think of that me I'm not going to light an efficiency that's really quick yeah it probably wasn't efficient basically when you floor it it doesn't matter what mode you're in it'll still give you maximum power it just makes the car a little bit less responsive to give you that power but anyway let's take the gearbox and stuff out the equation and Go full on sports mode right here we go three two one go oh the pickup on this is really good oh wow come on [Music] oh it's coming past now come on come on that was a close encounter with a seagull so the pickup on this is better than yours it really picked up so well but then you just started to pull on me yeah this this is nice I'll be honest this is nice as in fast or both nice and fast both nice and fast glad we established that finally all right now we have a brake test from 100 miles an hour the first car to stop wins if you'd rather watch a drag race with that M3 another one which is awesome click on the pop-out band up there for the link in the description below to go watch that instead if not stay here for the break test where I will surely win I've got to win something please win something here's the breaking Zone [Applause] foreign absolutely no way so we both stopped at exactly the same time as in hit the break sorry and this just kept going for the last bit didn't it that just dug in this was all right and I actually thought I was slightly late on the brakes so yeah this listen all round this is the one it's an amazing amazing car I absolutely love it I love this RS4 as well I used to have one but yeah that BMW is somewhere else however if you like a performance car that is less expensive for these I found one through car wire if you want to see what the car is and the deal click on the pop out there for the link in the description below now I hope you'll enjoyed the video if you did give it a like click on those windows there for some more videos and on that box there to get a car wow to silica the easy way subload photos of your carbon Bridge description then

      "corpus": "this is our 500 Civic it's got 400 000 miles on the clock it's got a salvage title the windshield wipers don't turn off and it's got four wet trash bags for suspension So today we're going to be installing four thousand dollars worth of suspension upgrades on our 500 Civic we're gonna be installing coilovers like these we're gonna be installing sway bars like these and we're gonna be installing whatever the heck this thing is that you see hanging off the bottom of every Civic ever I'm Zach welcome to Donut I'm a Honda boy now so I've never really been a Honda guy I've never owned a Honda I've never owned a Civic or an Integra and I've always wanted one and I really like the EG which is the generation that this is you know I really haven't driven it much I drove it up here today that was my first time driving it this is the slowest car I've ever driven so let's uh let's take a look under the hood and see what uh what the reason for that is so this is a D series uh four-cylinder look at the size of the intake tube it's like it's like a straw so this is one of those cars where you're never going to break the speed limit but you're gonna have a lot of fun so I'm excited to do some stuff to it like the suspension that we've got planned but first I just want to take a look around it's not in the best shape but that's okay she's got character but it's not about how things look it's about what's underneath it counts and I'm not sure that what's underneath of this car is any good either but we are gonna have some fun with it so right now let's go hop down the canyon run this thing around get used to it get to know it you know then we'll take it back to the shop and start upgrading some stuff for now my goals are just to get it handling a little bit more like a go-kart maybe make it look a little cooler but I also want to be able to get into the the Honda Community I hear there's a thing called VTEC Club out here which is a group of Honda owners that get together and hang out and you know have Honda needs I need to uh bask in all of its stock Glory right now get a feeling for how it feels right now with what might be the wall softest suspension I did feel very leaned over and like the whole car was on the front left tire pretty much yeah there's no tachometer so you just shift when it starts you know banging off the limiter so it feels crazy how much I've got my foot down I'm pedaled right now and I'm going through corners which is slow but fun okay so she's slow she's a little bit beat up she might be a little ugly but we're gonna fix that and she's home now let's work on this little pig Okay so we've got the Civic on the lift for the first time and before we go getting into all the fun stuff we're gonna give this thing a bit of an inspection see how much damage there is on the car see if there are any surprises and anything we need to fix that we don't already know about the first thing we're gonna do I got a pry bar we're just going to put it under the tire against the ground and go up and down and this will help us check for ball joints but all of these tests that we're going to do if you've got really bad parts you'll you'll probably notice so let's see how it feels not bad so what you're looking for there is like some clicking at the ball joints this has an upper and a lower ball joint and when I do this there's no like play so they they feel okay next thing we're going to do is grab the tire at three and nine and just shake back and forth and that feels pretty bad there's something wrong there so this should be pretty solid you'll get a little bit of movement but there shouldn't be any play any like clunkiness and I am getting some pretty significant clunkiness so that's usually indicative of a tie rod not sure if it's going to be inner or outer but you can kind of poke your head under there and look seems like the inner or maybe the whole steering rack is moving that sounds like a lot of noise so we'll have to dig a Little Deeper to find out exactly what's wrong but now we know that something's up with our steering system and up next we're going to grab the tire at 12 and 6 and go like this and this will help us check for a worn wheel bearing or you'll feel some play if you've got really worn control arm bushings and I do feel some play oh yeah okay so this Civic has dual Wishbone suspension so there's an a arm up here and one down below and just at first glance when I do that I can see the whole control arm moving and it looks like at least the forward bushing is totally blown out what I'm hoping is that it's just those bushings that's causing this play and that there's no issue with our wheel bearing and that we won't have to replace the wheel bearings but there's only one way to find out all right now that we've got the car up in the air and the wheels off we're going to check the rest of the suspension bushings and see what we're dealing with so to do that we've just got this pry bar and we're gonna you know poke some stuff so first let's look at some bushings that we know are bad we could tell that our upper control arm bushings were pretty whooped so let's shake them around see what they look like and you can see we've got a lot of play there but I think we're also going to have some side to side yeah that shouldn't do that and then at our front lower control arm at the front bushing you can see it's pretty much looks like it's entirely separated and if you look you can see that it's ripped all the way around the middle so it's probably pretty disconnected which doesn't lead to Great handling or a good feel oh this looks like an okay bushing I don't see any tears and it actually kind of looks relatively new let's give it a little pry yeah now that's kind of what you want to see from uh you know like a factory rubber bushing it's not flopping around there's no clunking no noises no tears it looks okay but we're gonna replace it anyway okay so now that we know that we've got a bunch of bad bushings it's time to go about replacing them [Music] let's look at the parts we're going to be replacing them with and compare them to the stock stuff first we'll start with the coilovers this is the stock one nothing special about it but we're going to be replacing it with these feel 441s these are basically feels entry level coilover they're damping adjustable 30 ways but it's uh it's one-way adjustment so rebound and compression is tied together because again these are pretty entry level coil over but you still get a lot of nice features you get ride height adjustability you get preload adjustability you get a nice spherical bearing Top Hat you do get the Swift Springs which should help with handling and they are valved for this chassis they should really improve the handling of this car so I'm excited about these so we just gotta stick them in there foreign [Music] [Music] so this is the stock control arm setup and you can see we've got rubber bushings in three places here one of which is totally gone and we will be reusing this arm here but replacing this outer arm like that and this bushing out here like this I was just looking at our kind of blown out rubber bushings here these are cheap they're good at reducing noise vibration and harshness and they wear pretty well they're good for for most people but you can see how much they move especially when they're worn out and the problem with that is that that causes a lot of deflection and twisting in your suspension and it changes your suspension geometry when you're in hard Corners which is really when you want your suspension geometry to be working the best so we're going to be replacing those okay and of course you could just press these out and replace them with new rubber bushings with polyurethane bushings or with spherical bushings like we're going to be using so we just got these they're nicely powder coated and they come with spherical bushings already installed and basically that's just a big metal ball in a housing which allows for rotation and angular movement so that these can move with your suspension like they need to but because it's a metal ball in a housing there's really no deflection so when you're under a hard cornering nothing to flex in any unpredictable way and you get to actually make use of that alignment that you paid for okay cool that was easy now flip this thing around and replace this bushing all right same thing here at the rear bushing for the lower control arm it's rubber so we're going to replace it with a spherical unit now that bushing looks like it's in fine shape but even a brand new rubber bushing will deflect a lot under load not the case for these okay we've got our front loaders put together so they're the first thing that's going to go on the car [Music] oh foreign this is the stock upper stamped steel piece with our blown out bushings and the new one is this the big advantages of this upper control arm is that you get adjustability in terms of camber and Caster where you don't really have any adjustability on this stock upper arm we will have a bunch of adjustability to be able to dial our alignment in exactly as we want it so I'm going to slap these in real quick yeah pretty much that [Music] and then the last thing we're going to do to the front of this car we've got this sweet Cusco strut brace the point of this is basically just to tie together the two strut Towers to keep them from flexing under hard cornering loads the only problem is that when I put it up here it sits pretty good but there are no holes where it seems like there should be holes so for a minute I thought that this was for the wrong car or something but turns out that most of these EG Civics have holes there but this trim level the CX doesn't have the holes so no big deal I mean what do you do when you don't have holes but you need some you guessed it drill something so that's what we're gonna do and then pretty much done with the front [Music] all right this car might be a bit of a clunker but it doesn't have very much rust so since we're drilling holes and exposing bare metal I'm gonna hit them with some paint real quick [Music] so far so good see roller truth looks like it worked all right the front is basically done so now it's time to start on the reward [Music] thank you all right here at the rear we've already got pretty much all the stock stuff taken out that we need to take out and it was in a little bit better shape than the fronts no fully blown out bushings or anything like that but we still got some stuff to replace obviously we're going to be using the same coilovers as the front as it feels and then we've got lower control arms from Megan basically the same deal as the control arms in the front although these are aluminum which is pretty nice but the big thing is that they've got spherical bearings for bushings so that'll tighten things up in the rear but the thing I want to talk about at the rear is the thing I've always wondered about this dang bar and you know this is obviously one for Megan but there are many like it and you always see them hanging out something like that on the backs of civics and I never really knew why that was what the purpose of that was and it turns out it's actually got two purposes first off this is our rear subframe and it's pretty flimsy or so they say so this helps reinforce it strengthen it up and you know it just gives it a little bit of extra bracing but also does a second thing these cars especially the lower trim models don't have sway bars okay like at all this car doesn't have a sway bar in the front or the rear but adding this in the rear gives us places to mount a sway bar so we can add one to the car and now you may have noticed we didn't do that in the front we still have no sway bar in the front but this is a front-wheel drive car which usually has some understeer so adding a big sway bar to the rear with this kit will allow us to dial in a little bit more oversteer or close to it and make this car feel a lot better and now I know what it is and so do you so now he's got to install it [Music] so I've got news to install the sway bar that we just talked about we need to remove the muffler this massive Muffler here it kind of intersects the area where the sway bar needs to mount so luckily the exhaust comes apart right here so I can just take the muffler off but this thing is going to sound probably pretty bad but that's okay we'll fix it in the future we'll get a better exhaust [Music] foreign [Music] yes dude I'm so stoked for this yeah [Music] well we've got our brace and our sway bar hanging all tightened up so now we can start throwing in these control arms and then the coilers [Music] thank you see these are solid bushings yeah they are literally they're spherical so if you give it a push you'll get it to break free [Music] all right one of the last things we're gonna do in the rear is replace These Arms which go right there with these and the difference is well not only are these stamped steel and these are tubular but these are adjustable and that'll give us adjustment over camber which is pretty important for dialing in a good performance oriented alignment okay and here we've got a rear strut brace from Cusco matches the one in the front we're just going to tie together our two strut Towers to add a little bit of rigidity and of course a little bit of STEEZ well I was afraid that might be the case we got to trim the interior a little bit [Music] not my best work but it works okay now this thing is ready to go to the alignment shop and then we'll take it back to the streets let it rip oh yeah I forgot the muffler is off you can't even tell rabbit damn it sounds awesome so we're back in the canyons to rip up and down the hill to see if installing all these expensive suspension parts on such a cheap car was actually worth it let's go for a drive foreign [Music] the first thing I noticed is how much less body roll there is this thing stays way flatter through all the corners and feels great I mean it makes it feel much more predictable but it's way more fun now I mean it's it's like a go-kart so everything we put on this car is a fairly mid-range Park you know we could have spent way more money and we could have spent less but I think the mid-range is really where The Sweet Spot is that's where you get the most bang for your buck and I'm super happy with what we chose but it's going to be a lot of fun to wrench on this thing and get into the Honda World a little bit and I think we made a big first step this thing feels so much better I hope you guys had fun watching this video it was fun

      "corpus": "the car we're dealing with here is the bang shift cougar a 1967 Mercury Cougar that was in the very first episode of roadkill garage and you know what this is the very first episode of season six so it's been five years since we originally put this together and there's a whole backstory of me buying the car and then getting it running and then trading it off to Steve but what's important is that it initially had a 351 Cleveland in it it now has a Ford Windsor 302 based 363 cubic inch stroker in it and most importantly the four speed that makes it the bang shift cougar the problem is it doesn't Bank shift anymore because the clutch slips really badly and we think that that's because of an oil leak at the back of the engine and this engine has leaked oil out of the back forever it dates all the way to when Mike Finnegan and I drove a Ford Ranchero all the way to Alaska with this engine in it and it leaked then and then it leaked when dulcich rebuilt it and we were testing it on the engine Masters show and then surprise it leaked again then when we actually installed it in this car and so the first thing we're going to do is rip the top loader four speed out of the car so that we can see what clutch disc we need and perhaps even find the source of that endless oil leak so that we can fix that as well [Music] that was it everyone's got this transmission ready to come out wow there's a bunch of dog hair and rat poop in here no way are you ready to have it out I think we'll come right out oh it's coming right out okay ready for down yeah at this point we have gravity working Target management oh oil there we go all right this is what makes this entire car great the cougar is nothing without the top loader no [Music] the bell housing is off right this clutch is completely fried that is going to be it that is roasted that is char broiled this is the clutch disc out of the cougar and it is absolutely the most destroyed thing I've ever seen for a clutch disc that has a maybe 50 miles on it that is wrecked one thing it is not though is oily we thought it was probably saturated with oil from the leak at the back of the engine and it isn't so why is it ruined probably because we never broke it in in standard roadkill fashion we installed it and we went out and did burnouts for your viewing pleasure that probably wrecked that thing completely because that's unbelievable but we still do have an incredible oil leak and we've been investigating hardcore under there to see what it is this is the mid plate that goes between the bell housing and the back of the engine and by looking at it we can see really carefully some witness marks of oil leaks on this thing and it's either coming from the cam plug which is about right here on the back of the engine or from the oil pan gasket immediately at the back of the engine right under the rear main seal doesn't seem to be the seal itself it's one piece seal would be be shocked if that's what it was so what we're going to do is something fairly Mickey Mouse but also kind of Genius we're going to fill the engine with automatic transmission fluid which is really just a very very light oil and we're going to see if we can actually watch it dripping out of the bottom of that oil pan seal and if it's not it's probably the cam plug foreign it's pouring out of the bolt hole in the crankshaft you can put a bolt in there okay so we know it's well above that point okay no glistening so now I'm waiting [Music] the oil leak investigation is complete and sure enough it is leaking out of this oil pan gasket seal at the back of the engine it's not the rear main seal this aftermarket pan is just not squishing the seal at the back enough and it's dripping out of there so I think what we're going to do is drop the pan at the back clean it all up in there and smudge some RTP in it and put it back together which is not the right way to do it but it's the roadkill garage where you do it it'll be good enough [Music] now I probably should have been concentrating on some Mechanicals but check out the sweet interior I had a chance to put the upholstery kit on the seats and put the carpet in there's a bunch more work to do to get it perfect the way I want to but that's not the important Point here the thing I need to do to make this car run and drive is fix the braking system now this is the master cylinder I got for it this is made for front disc brakes so it doesn't have a residual pressure valve in the front brake Port so that's going to fix the problem because the residual pressure valve for a drum brake setup will cause a drag with the disc brakes and it's brand new not 50 years old so we're going to be putting that in in the back we're just going to rebuild the rear drum brakes I've got new shoes I've got new wheel cylinders we have a spring kit and I've got new brake drums we're going to check all the lines below them out make sure they're all clear and then hopefully get this thing started up and hit the road well Steve's handling the master cylinder I've been assigned to rebuild the rear brakes here's some like Antiquated wrenching information for you primary and secondary brake drum shoes these days they often use the same length of lining on both the front and the rear or primary and secondary shoe but you'll notice that some nuts like this AC Delco set have a longer lining on one than they do on the other now people have argued for many years about which is which I'm going to go by the manual and say short shoe front long shoe rear I got the shoes and springs all on everything's happy there and then I grabbed my brand new brake drum and even with the adjuster all the way in so smallest diameter on the pads I could not get our new brake drum on check this out this caliper is maxed out right there on the inside diameter of that drum and I move over here to this one and it's roughly 3 16 bigger and that's not just because this one's been turned and that one hasn't there's a problem here I don't know if it's an application or if the part's just wrong but I'm going to end up using the old drums they're not too bad [Music] [Music] you're gonna block the motor if you keep doing that once again utter crushing defeat instead of the bank shift cougar this thing's become the clutch eating cougar I had to hit the road and do some other stuff but then dolsich stepped in like a beast he pulled the engine again and installed yet another clutch because we obviously didn't break in that second clutch enough again this time he installed a six-puck drag race clutch that doesn't require as much break in and it also has more pressure to it next he fixed the oil leak that you guessed it was still there he found out that the reason this engine is puked oil ever since it was in The Ranchero years ago was that the gallery plugs the back of the block were never fully tightened he fixed that and then the oil pan and put it all back together in a Solo four day bloody knuckle thrash to bring you what you deserve so without any further excuses we give you the shift cooter [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] all right oh thanks popper [Music] [Music] as you know though the windy Mountain Road is not what the cougar is actually famous for now what is the cougar season for the woods the trees at first the Lang shift the bang shift yeah yeah I'm actually liking this cougar handling I feel like Dan Gurney amazing [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] that's the drive shaft [Music] darnabb [Music] [Music] Ed my eardrums I thought this was supposed to be quiet they're called Mufflers I guess you're right what we'll do is we'll take these top mounting bolts off first yeah gotta be careful this the whole cases crack yeah I know okay the last bolt out of the transmission and the whole corner of the transmission case just hit the deck man this thing is totally destroyed all right drop that thing in Steve I'll hook it on all right coming down somewhere around there okay hold on how about there that's good okay a coil spring can kill you you want the right tools and you want to do it the right way what we're doing here is a little sketchy and I don't recommend it I think that's free now it's free I wonder if this is gonna work like this I guess that's how it works right we're gonna find out yeah [Music] okay you know what now we just slowly and carefully release it you know what the problem is going to be it's going to run out of travel on that thing before it's all the way unloaded that's what I was curious about too yeah all right well we got ourselves into a little bit of a conundrum kind of a pickle isn't it yeah no but I know how to take that apart oh yeah yeah we could fix it with fire ow and with that I've been a do to the coil spring goodbye coil spring I will not miss you [Music] foreign slice what do you think about that Steve look at that [Music] seriously Wiley this is probably one of the best modifications you could do to an old muscle car and that's an overdrive transmission I'm jealous this is a tkx transmission it's a replacement for the old TKO it's brand spanking new in fact this is probably one of the first kits for a Ford application it's from a company called Silver sport transmission they have transmission swap kits not only for this but all kinds of different transmissions in all kinds of classic muscle car applications so it's got a 0.68 overdrive which is going to give me a sweet cruising gear yeah and then one through four is like a close ratio four speed okay this is getting serious transmission installation is going to begin by installing the flywheel and clutch then the bell housing and hopefully we'll swing the transmission and after that I think he goes just like that that's tight I think you got him pretty close with the gun yeah all right Wiley clutch me bro dude this is a pretty aggressive looking little clutch you know when I open the box on this thing I totally freaked out because it looked like it was a 10 and a half and I needed an 11 but then I noticed that every other paddle is longer and shorter so oh yeah so they're actually offset which utilizes more surface area on the flywheel right yeah I just love these paddle clutches man I was burning out regular clutches left and right and then I remember I started using these race clutches and they shift cleaner because there's way less inertia and man they don't burn up you can just pound on them right away so this is good I think this is dosage proof I won't promise you that we maybe the transform now I think it probably is let's find out let me talk about the rear end what I have here is a Ford 9 inch and nothing here comes from the junkyard everything you see is brand new and heavy duty so it's going to be bulletproof with the five-speed transmission and a high horsepower Windsor engine the housings from Curry as is the differential carrier the differential carrier is heavy duty nodular iron it's filled out with the 389 gear set an Ethan true track differential and it's set up for 31 spline axle shafts I knew the 8-inch rear end that was in the car was going to break so I've had this built to last it's got Wilwood disc brakes at each end and I'm going to swing it into the car right now dude that is nine inches of absolute beef yeah it's pretty good so far you're there did you like the jack stand trick yeah it's really good [Music] lower it lower [Music] there we go on the PIN one thing I noticed on these spring plates that they sent us is that they've got two different shock mounting tabs on there the high performance Fords will sometimes have stagger shocks one in the front and one in the back and so this accommodates that it's pretty good okay mine's on pinned now oh wow I like those big slotted mounting bolts yeah me too here comes a drive shaft not even dosage bang shifting can break fortunately Driveline services in Fresno dials Us in fast with this stuff we really appreciate those guys this has 1350 U-joints at both ends and uh it's gonna be beef [Music] oh I slid it in now it won't come out I need a hammer there we go you guys might be puzzling over what exactly I'm doing here so I'm gonna explain it very clearly this thing that looks like a radiator will not cool my engine so I want to put another one in I can't order the correct radiator for a 67 cougar with the small block Ford so I'm gonna take another radiator that's lying around and I'm just gonna make it fit oh yeah the only thing that's really still a mystery to me is whether or not the hood will close I think it will hey what's it hitting don't tell me it's the radiator ah that radiator is way too tall the hood doesn't shut so I'll see if I can find a resolution otherwise it's back to the drawing board okay I don't think that's going anywhere I think it just needs to be zip tied right here at the top [Music] all right so that's the radiator to hood clearance problem solved [Music] [Applause] your eyes 681 681 I don't know if I'm topping that here's the irony loud pipe save lives I'm wearing earplugs that thing is loud now he's gonna cheat and do a brake drag I know but you know what dosage is about to put on a show and go [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he only went about as far as me even cheating to me dragging brakes like that can look fun but it doesn't show the actual power of the car for me the actual Full Throttle burnout for distance no brake drag is the key [Music] and donuts are stupid but fun [Applause] [Music]"

      "corpus": "rev up your engines okay we got a 2011 Mazda 3 the original owner we'll see how it's held up he said some problems with the HVAC system that they've never really fixed one we're gonna look into that but first look at the overview it was like a 21 000 car when he bought it new it's got about 90 000 miles and you can see why people buy them they're good looking cars that's a 12 year old one so it's not the zoom zoom of the newer ones but in some perspectives it's actually better because it's got variable valve timing but it is a 2.5 liter four-cylinder engine so it's got a reasonable amount of horsepower without Agony turbo and all those complex systems see when we take off the stupid Beauty cover it's conventional engine it's got coil unplugged there's some insulation maybe the rats were in there I don't know if I wasn't burnt oil still runs fine with 90 something thousand miles on it no he did say that sometimes when it's cold outside the shifting could be a little bit weird in the winter the main problems with these mazda3s are this is the old older one and it's got a jetco automatic transmission if you follow me you know I'm not a fan of Jekyll automatic transmission the later model ones after 2015 Mazda started making their own Transmissions but Mazda makes them and they've proven to be relatively Bulletproof the problem with Mazdas historically has been weak automatic transmissions and jadco didn't add anything positive to that even way back when they were always notorious for having weak automatic transmissions I had customers that went through two or three of them if they cut them 100 150 000 miles this one's still working got a little problem when it's cold but that's the main thing if you think about Mazda 3 I would wait to see if you could get one that has the Mazda transmission and not the jet car that's the juices car which is kind of obvious because you can see these strut Towers have rust on them that's superficial Ross look underneath to see how the undercarriage is held up and really if you look at it it's held up pretty well not rusted through anywhere even the Allied wheels are still in pretty good shed for all that salt and corrosion that they throw on the road in the winter in Massachusetts so they've obviously come a long way from they did in the past when they were rust buckets that's not a problem now his main complaint was his HVAC system was clicking away so he took it in coronavirus came they didn't have anybody working he brought it back and they said they replaced some stuff but it's still clicking then they tried to sell them a heater core well he wasn't losing coolant or anything and he didn't smell it but he thought it was kind of odd that they were trying to sell them a heater core now after they worked on the car he was getting the clicking noises he's still getting the clicking noises but worse than that and now it's got a point where sometimes it puts out air conditioner one side heat on the other side which it never did before he had the car worked on so obviously they screwed something up there's no way that a vehicle is supposed to act like that something definitely is rotten in Denmark oh let's start checking it out what's up we'll go to Diagnostics so Mazda 3 they were also called axles in Japan 2.5 liter automatic while we're away and you can see it's got a little over 85 000 miles on it original owner Interiors held up quite well no rips or tears now the weird thing is the automatic temperature control system shows no Faults yet it's acting up starter up we're trying to cabin temperature here Air Max actuator says it's off let's turn it on well it's turned it on that's working put it on heat but not heat we'll put it on cool it's putting our cool air now that's working but now it's putting out heat again putting out heat we don't have it on he's not putting out cool let's see if it changes again yes it's putting out heat again now I never did that for them before but as you can see when I activated it it was hot then when I put it to cool it was cool but then it immediately started to turn itself back to hot so something's wrong we'll see what we can figure out with the scan tool there now here we go we can look at cabin temperature here now showing the cabin temperature would be 29 degrees Celsius which is like 84 Fahrenheit and it is putting out warm air now but when I try to get cool there it's not cool there but it's warm there let's check out sensors are acting up the left sense is showing 20 but the right sensor is doing John 22. so they're exactly the same so it's not like the sun is given wrong data they're both given the same data like the evaporator temperature is wrong because that's 11 degrees Celsius that's the cool part 12 a little bit warmer now so the air conditioning is working right the heating is working right but it is mixing them wrong coming into the vehicle which it never did before they worked on the car we're checking for codes on the system for the whole heating system and it's showing codes for bald solar sensors and it shows there's a failure 13 that the circuit is open well let's face the facts they worked on it they went inside the dash now the circuit is open for both solar sensors meaning they probably knocked the wire off when they were doing the work now as soon as he gets a clicking noise so we're going to roll the window up so we can hear better and we'll activate the switches here right it's off turn on well cold air now you can hear it clicking inside definitely hear a click inside there hear it there it goes now let's turn it off you heard a click again let's turn it on again collect again we'll turn it off didn't collect that time but you're already collecting an airflow on and all of a sudden it's putting out hot air when we haven't set it cold air it was blowing cold there let's turn it off now it's blowing cold there instead of hot air we haven't changed any of the adjustments so now all of this occurred other than the clicking noise that's always been there they said they replaced the actuator in there I doubt if they replaced anything because it's making the same noise that it made before only now it's putting out hot air and cold air by itself without doing anything and it shows there's an open in the circuit the solar census is supposed to see the hottest how cold it is how to make it work with that system being out of the loop I'm assuming now the computer is just guessing because it doesn't have any data so it's not going hot cold hot cold you didn't have this hot cold problem until they worked on the car and the clicking hasn't gone away they obviously screwed up but they're saying oh no we replaced these parts and all you need a heater core now it doesn't mind the winter because the Heat's always coming on and off but there's enough heat the problem is when it's hot in the summer is turn the AC on the heat on the AC on the heat on and that is really annoying now it's pretty given up on the Mazda dealer because they keep telling them stuff they did and they didn't fix anything and then they want 2600 to replace the heater core right so I got a solution if he wants to try it go to the heater car right oh you have to do is either splice them together then you'll have no heater or you could put a valve in line on them I've done this with mercedes-benzas for decades because some of their stuff's even worse well it's 8 400 to fix the HVAC system right put a little valve on each one of those in the summer you can just turn the valve off and you won't get hot air than cold air there won't be any hot air and then in the winter you can just open the valves up it's a real easy fix now fire him I take it back to the dealer and say you did the stuff and look I got this code for these solar things it never existed before and now you must have messed something up when you were inside that Dash which is logical explanation now with all this complexity of computer stuff and then wanting 2 600 bucks your heater core me I'd probably just put little valves on those hoses and leave it at that he's been driving it for three years this way anyway and with that he'd have nice and cold air in the summer and in the winter he could just open the valves up real simple fictional if you didn't want to put valves you could splice the two together and then you'd have no heat at all in the summer which who cares and then in a winter you could just splice them back in you wouldn't even need valves the car itself hey it runs fine for and everything he didn't like that little rattly noise and then after they worked on it and I was getting heat cold heat cold wow you can't blame the car on that one it's obviously the guys working on them and unfortunately I see that all the time at Mazda dealership their service departments generally aren't all that up to Snuff and this was during the coronavirus when they were probably hiring people off the street to work there that didn't know what they were doing they've obviously boxed something up in the dash but hey it's pretty easy to put a little valve in there just turn the heat off in the summer put it back on the winter rather than tear that Dash apart because it's hunting back and forth they obviously did something to the solar wiring for the sensors because it's showing there's an open chart in the system you'd have to tear a little Dash apart again so maybe put on a little valve he likes the car and he's been driving it with this hot cold for three years so now he knows how to turn the heat off and here's some bonus questions and answers wondering Juan says I'm a longtime driver but a first-time buyer usually I get hand-me-down vehicles I've had a Galaxy 588 Dodge Aries 88 Plymouth Reliant 94 Camry but now I'm buying a car I'm leaning towards the Corolla cross and I like the cargo do the cvtis cons outweigh the pros no because it's a Toyota Corolla cross Toyota makes the best CVT transmissions in the world my son drives like a maniac he has a Corolla S with a CVT he likes that it's fast which is rare for most cvts but that one is and it actually gets better gas mileage than it was rated for so Toyota does make the best cvts in the world if I was going to buy a car with a CVT I don't particularly like them I would get the Toyota we even thinking about getting one if somebody smashes into our Matrix and we're traveling or something I probably would replace it with a Toyota Corolla Cross or a Toyota hatchback one or the other Toyota Corolla ass back I'd probably take one of those right I mean mine are wearing out but you never know when you're gonna get in a wreck so you might as well plan ahead right they have a solid track record with their cvts especially the more modern ones they have the lawn care and stuff in it they're phenomenal Engineering in those things that wouldn't chase me away at all so if you never want to miss another one of my new car repair videos remember to ring that Bell [Music] foreign"

multiple things including this show Finney from Queens than Long Island now Long Beach by way of many different things anatra tell these people about your pretty much stock car okay put some respect on it this is my 2010 997.2 GT3 RS foreign stock GT3 RS engine it's a 3.8 liter flat six rated at 450 brake horsepower from the factory it has GMG three to one equal length headers high flow cats and a jcr titanium exhaust otherwise stock it's got some Redline solid motor mounts that's it these cars are not drag cars so you don't really do a ton of performance but this car actually has so much done to it chassis and suspension wise every single bushing has been replaced with spherical or heim joints it's got jrz RS Pro three-way coilovers girodisc steel conversion brake rotors it's got RS 4.0 canards it has a light and flywheel and clutch from the RS 4.0 I think that's it foreign we have Factory carbon bucket 991 manual steering wheel gt2rs ship knob GMG four point roll bar that mounts the jrz coilover reservoirs Big Nerd stuff is these cars are all about spec this car actually has a really cool spec so it's got leather Dash with red stitching which is super rare painted center console red stitching on the seats but it's really a driver-centric car it is a 2010 it's sort of that last Arrow before cars got packed with stuff it literally has one button you shut off traction control and that's it there's no other sort of assist that this car has it's very raw very analog and it's honestly the coolest driving experience ever [Music] it's a gray black on red setup from the factory so all the graphics and stuff are Factory on the GT3 RS you get a deeper front lip these are actually aftermarket from the RS 4.0 which is the last of this generation GT3 RS with a bigger motor the RS comes with front fender flares to make a wider track width and you're run a wider front tire the rear of the car is actually 20 millimeters wider on the RS from the base GT3 or any other Carrera besides the turbo and 4S Factory no sunroof it comes with a big carbon fiber spoiler Center exit exhaust this generation car came with the center lock wheels which a lot of the track guys switch out to five lug but I think they're super cool so I'm going to keep them overall this car to me is the ultimate driver's car super raw visceral like it's not comfortable at all it feels like what I wanted to build all of my crappy cars leading up to this into so like I had e36s and e46s that I made into dual purpose cars and my dream was making them this and then I got this and I'm like wow this is Leaps and Bounds better than those cars honestly it's surreal that I even have this and it was never meant to be drag race but it's fun because we do it on the show so whatever you've got an old car with steel beams whether they're seven inch like this or this or this or maybe you got a couple of these bad boys maybe you just have one either way this 4x6 steel beam rectangle still pretty crappy lighting our friends at Morimoto have worked with Holly to come up with this the Retro bright a retro looking light with modern tech they're twice the light output of halogens flow draw extended life but they're also compliant no glare beam pattern check the description below for all the sizes more details [Music] I am super proud to announce the next guest here on the show a man who's been on the show the first time doing a walk around on a car that I own I've driven other cars I don't own on the show who are you and what do you bring here today I'm Brian Scotto a co-founder of the company you might have heard of called hoonigan and uh this is my Ferrari f360 which is uh kind of a dream car status after my 911 so this is like dream car number two thank you so under this is a Ferrari V8 3.6 liter to put that into comparison my Nova is a 555 which is about nine liters think of what that makes making 400 horsepower which is 3.6 liters and it does that because the thing reps to 8 500 which is make it what makes it sound so good everything under here is pretty much stock aside from I've got some Fab speed exhaust setup and carbon air boxes and things like that but otherwise this is how you get it oh I've also got some headers here you can see them under there they look nice these things came with a rather complicated suspension that's been removed and it's got jrz's all around external reservoirs it's amazing thing rides super smooth but also handles really well it's like the perfect combination foreign so this thing has a center lock conversion as you can see no bolts just one big one because this vehicle was actually tracked unfortunately it's got some like I don't want to say All Seasons but they're pretty close to All Seasons on it because the vehicle did have race tires on it before I bought it while this car doesn't have much in terms of performance mods it does have all of the external pasta needed it's got the ngt kit which is the front bumper rear bumper and Wing setup which just makes it look more sporty yeah most incredible part of this whole car is I actually fit look I can touch my knees underneath at six foot eight it's one of the few super cars that like really tall guys can fit in it has challenged tradali seats so these are the seats out of the kind of race car setup that they sold instead of the Modena it's got some carbon fiber bits that it didn't come with but that's pretty much it this model is a paddle shift this particular model is the F1 paddle shift it is not a DCT it is not a dual clutch style setup it is a regular manual transmission like it's actually the same manual trans that comes in the Gated version except there's a control or automated unit that ships for you that's it it's what came also on the challenge to Dolly it's technically the faster of the two because it shifts faster it's not bad I think maybe one day this will go gated but it's pretty good for just driving and just to let people know it's a race car the previous owner did some nice yellow lenses that way you know that you're racing in like a GT2 GT3 class in Le Mans and obviously there's a tow hook so you know proper race car but the most important part is win or lose it'll always be a Ferrari [Music] this is a tough one because I'm actually more of a Porsche guy than I am a Ferrari guy my gut wants to like root for the Porsche but I don't know I also think the car is faster but we'll see Brian is physically a big Ferrari guy so I don't know what he's talking about but yeah I'm gonna win Vin's gonna win that's why it went all I want to say is I'm very very proud of Vincenzo for wearing the Long Island contractor jacket today just to get the roots back that being said I Gotta Give it to Vin that thing's way newer it's really fast and Vin knows how to Pedal nothing against the Ferrari Ferrari might win on sound though yeah I want you to be honest I've never seen Brian Scotto outside of that church fan he drives but I smoked but I smoked Larry Chan in the church man cut to the footage foreign he's watched a bunch of rally racing damn it I'm going in I did more race car driving before you were born you have convinced me I'm going Finn I'm for job's sake I'm going with Mr Scott you're the only person on my side for me you idiot [Music] race of the century Brian Scotto versus Vin one person's gonna lose their job the other one person has to stay here and answer emails all day who will it be get this thing off of my race track God dang Millennials and your toys I spice so if you watch hoonigan coming to Hoon again no this man unfortunately okay you guys ready [Music] foreign you won all right let's wrap it up what do you want get over here come on bro we're getting out or we just keep real quick this man act like he never did this before sure first off all right one of the best sounding races we may have ever had no I want to listen to it yeah I know so good but but we got 10 years difference in cars yeah so we kind of knew the GT3 yeah yeah there's also a bit of a delay from like there was yeah so what we're saying definitely I definitely want the hit you get the hit what did he win by six bars oh two cars in the hit to the 500 you go forward what do you mean two cars in the head uh-huh you go forward so it's shorter okay 500. okay sure so I'll stand up that's a good race that's a good race yeah hey hold on you're ready [Music] [Music] what's up it was to 500 though not a thousand yeah I don't know I was over here looking at you looking like so long I'm so confused don't let Ferrari see this race [Music] I don't know what to do do I put it in neutral I just burned you down where'd you down now actually if you sit for too long it goes to neutral so as soon as I hit the throttle it went to neutral roll raise okay a roll race to a thousand feet yeah okay Scotto won no it's crazy we were supposed to race to 500 500. yeah I kept going and he went around me to the Thousand yeah [Music] all right [Music] like I'm watching the outrun right now I feel like he likes me on a Friday night at a party they keep smoking more and more that's enough from you go home I've been buy a car oh that's impressive yeah that's impressive was doing a 20 roll and instantly with red lights [Music] oh that concludes the best sounding race I think we've had in a minute the second race I think we need a little clarification this car's faster than mine that's what happened but not to 500 on the second race yeah but I had his band this man had the weirdest launch strategy which was could kind of just not go until the car shifted into neutral if it sits for too long in first so he just was waiting for a while and then the minute he dropped his hands I hit the throttle and it was in neutral and I was like oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] you beat Vin to 500 on that race but then you guys actually ended up going to a thousand actually you went you went free bird you went you got 1500 every race yeah because it just sounds stand up that often so why not so give it an Italian tune-up while you're out here you know you forget your fork the spaghetti Fork whatever you want besides you guys BS racing I'm proud that you actually drove your car yeah I've ever ridden in a Ferrari and the first time I ever driven with him driving a car it was amazing Absolutely I'll take you for a ride on the rabbit sometime around the neighborhood no thanks a little bit you get literally fine"

eventually someday one day this house can be organized but for the time being we gotta deal with what we have now let's see um yes I would try to get this garage organized so it can actually be functional but in the end term everything is kind of just sort of in the way now these wheels are some of the coolest Wheels we've ever had from rwb that's right from Akira Nakai ladies and gentlemen these are so sick like I said I've already seen themselves I'm still very excited though because they turned out absolutely incredible raw welt the grief ladies and gentlemen for the Nissan Z check these babies out once the air ride is done these wheels are mounted The Stance the fitment is gonna be actual Perfection these wheels are so sick they turned out so good now we got a ton to do in today's video what is finally an absolutely perfect day here in the state of Utah it's gonna be 80 degrees for the next five days so we gotta race off to Envision we gotta drop off the new wheels for the Nissan Z there finalizing the air ride that should be done next week and then the warehouse I have had that warehouse for about two and a half years and unfortunately today kind of sort of out of nowhere we got to get everything out right now now we got to get the new wheels for the Nissan Z off to Envision so you're probably thinking oh we're gonna take one of the trucks and we could do that but why would we do that when we have 800 horsepower and a six and a half liter V12 a 12 super fast it's gonna be way too loud but no you gotta protect your ears come on back yeah come on every single time I cold started this car I automatically feel bad because it's gonna be so loud all right [Applause] come on that's a Ferrari if my calculations are correct that should be that should be easy well I think I said to say the boo was designed for one wheel it's a long story but the other two wheels are already off at Envision perfect good this car oh my gosh with the brilliant exhaust I love this thing so much if you guys saw my last video you know how rare it is to see another Hummer EV they've only built like 850 of those it's also on California plates which begs the question how many times did it take to charge to get here to Utah I know I'm just kidding it's but still it does beg the question five times six I don't know I also feel like the boys that Envision are purposely leaving this card out every single time I come here the matte black is so Sinister but what do you guys think you like the matte black better the white or should we go I don't know something profound and classy like perp then just kidding I finally realized exactly why I have the super fast and not the GTS it's because this is a utilitarian vehicle I use it to transport valuable Goods easy it is a farm truck I'm just gonna throw this out here as an idea but imagine for one Split Second nader8 white Wheels on the E2 super fast why isn't it done I don't know could we actually get those powder coated just the factory wheels yeah you know a guy you got 25 minutes uh yeah actually oh okay that's so good um yeah we gotta get out of here a lot of you guys have been wondering where is Sophia what happened to my girlfriend Sophia just because we can okay okay we gotta you know what a lot of you guys probably don't realize this and that's because I never said it Sophia is actually from Canada she lives in British Columbia she's a Canadian citizen so when she comes to visit me here in Utah in the United States she's actually visiting as like a foreigner and per year legally the United States allows her to only be here five months and 29 days per year on January 1st 2024 we'll reset back to zero so we have to be kind of like a little bit strategic on when she comes to visit so to answer everyone's question Sophia is in Canada she'll be back probably June maybe middle of June now on that bombshell I'm very excited to announce today's video has been sponsored by my homies over at Vero now I first told you guys about Vero a couple months ago and since then so many you guys have joined the platform it has been so much fun to see the car Community just continue to grow and continue to expand now if you're not a part of there yet it's not a big deal because it's not too late all you got to do is check out the link in the description below go create a Navarro account and if you want give me a follow my username is the strad man the thing I love about Vero it's such a tight-knit car Community it's so easy to interact and engage with everybody and also there's no ads and there's no algorithm now I've been posting bunch of content over on Vero content you guys can be fairly familiar with with a slightly different angle things like what music did I listen to on my road trip from Miami to Utah my Lamborghini Countach behind the scenes photos behind the scenes videos now tomorrow on Vero I am dropping a first look of first exclusive of the brand new wheels for my full carbon fiber Aventador so my homies over at Rohana they just texted me a photo of the new Wheels they're gonna be here in about two weeks I'm gonna post that photo on Vero tomorrow now these reels I want to get you guys feedback these wheels are crazy and the first look the first exclusive is on Vero tomorrow the photos on Vero are also super high quality there's minimal compression and the resolution is absolutely incredible now like I said a lot of the things that you don't see on YouTube You'll see here on Vero for example this triple white Lamborghini Countach this never made the YouTube channel but it made the Vero account or for example my Ferrari 458 is puffing blue smoke and is uh getting ready to self-empload not entirely sure what to do with that car it's kind of hard to quantify exactly what makes Vero so refreshing compared to the other social media networks it just has these intangibles that makes it incredibly enjoyable the community is amazing the community is growing and I truly believe you guys are going to love it check out the link in the description below go create a profile on Vero go give me a follow my username as a stratman and let's get the car Community growing let's make it explode on Vero foreign so as you guys know I moved into the new house back in October but before that I had the rental house and I had the warehouse well the lease on the warehouse had continued on and it's finally expiring at the end of this month so I got to get everything out now I've been in this warehouse for two and a half years and I've accumulated so much junk and so much nonsense and somehow someway obviously I procrastinated we got to get everything off to the new house now we have a NASCAR and we have a Ferrari race car more than likely both of them will not turn on I'm not sure how we're gonna get them back to the house but we got to do it today now the ogs might remember this Warehouse is where I revealed the Bugatti Veyron I kind of leased it on a whim it ended up being a blessing in disguise because I need a location for the veteran but then I ended up actually living here for a while we obviously stored a ton of cars now I am going to miss the warehouse but the lease is three thousand dollars a month I have the space of the new house it doesn't make sense and an extra 3K a month that's gonna be a third of my mortgage it's kind of crazy to be saying bye to this Warehouse we have so many crazy memories like I built the pink Liberty Walk events are right there obviously we lived here in the warehouse now we gotta get the NASCAR the 430 challenge out of here and unfortunately I knew this was it's gonna be a tough day it would appear ever so slightly just by smidge the NASCAR tires are a little flat [Music] foreign [Music] 's in charge it's hard to imagine a scenario in which this could possibly go wrong nothing could go wrong right we're not going to get pulled over we're not going to lose a NASCAR nothing can go wrong no idea to pass life you're an eagle scout right more or less honor that's right wait were you actually I was no you actually were okay the day before my 18th birthday let's go baby okay you see the confidence level is increasingly higher than Kyle's involved because if it was just me well obviously yeah if we could hold me I could hold a car right thick thighs save lies this is crazy we're getting the ultimate stamp of approval now Kyle is an eagle scout every single time I've ever been stuck in anything in my entire life the ultimate test from Clayton Stark ladies and gentlemen it is a knot okay but 10 and 10 can we confirm you did the same technique that's the same thing it can pull me Jeeves you got the thick thighs yeah big thighs save lives baby that's not going anywhere yeah yeah we're good we're good here to stay it's a really really good thing the Jeeves and I are here supervising you know what I'm saying because like you got to have two supervisors for each two technical gurus but we got the best in the business right now how is this gonna function hey fun fact I am an eagle scout too wait really yeah what are you talking about what you guys are all wait seriously is that some kind of like thing is that a thing on my honor I will do my best that's all I remember it's just a little bit of rubbing what keep going just easy easy easy this is too easy no big deal and of course naturally we have the student driver pass Us in the right lane now the real question is obviously the brakes brakes don't sound very good in the NASCAR I'm trying to catch as much tension as I possibly can on that toe strap unfortunately we couldn't get the NASCAR turned on it also had a massive oil leak I don't want to risk it whatsoever I don't want to touch this car it's not my car I don't even know what oil it takes obviously driving this car on the road is something illegal too I know we've done it but we probably shouldn't have we are almost home free I am maintaining laser focus right now because if for some reason Kyle hits the brakes and I remember in my own truck as if my neighbors haven't been through enough what can you do well that actually works out way better than I was imagining I owe you the best meal you've ever had in your entire life you just save me a couple hundred bucks so thank you for not only your expertise but your excellent driving as well so I think we're gonna try to drop this baby maybe in the bat cave for now I think yeah backing how exhausting that is my heart is absolutely pounding right now she's a light girl but she's not that light also the camera that we just got installed it's cool but it doesn't do that much well want a legal race car down one more illegal race car to go however the Ferrari maybe we could drive it it's just something about summertime in Utah all the supercars are out baby ironically enough the NASCAR is actually easier than the Ferrari race car so we're gonna try to jump start it off the TRX and just well we're just gonna hope and pray I wonder how many times I have jump started a car on the channel we got positive negative and of course we have negative positive the Ferrari race car has been sitting for a very very long time so we're probably gonna have to charge it for about I'm starting to realize more and more why I haven't driven the Nascar or the Ferrari race car come on baby the likelihood that this works main power admission oh we got power honestly that's way better than I was imagine okay we're gonna just let it show for a little bit longer it's been about 10 minutes come on Ferrari work with me work with me unfortunately I have officially given up for the time being we have a special hero who I think is going to help us out but uh what's it like to be a hero filming yeah of course we're live what do you mean I've been filming all day I'm exhausted thank you Happy New Year I wasn't ready for this you look well groomed what's up I haven't showered in three days I don't have hot water you guys don't know that I have not yet all right bye just so your viewers see you actually do something you you didn't do stuff all the time yeah but you did that so because I did this you do that no is that where we're at keep going you're on a hot streak we're gonna get made fun of well don't worry lighting is terrible so give yourself some credit look at that thing you were a Cub Scout now before anybody criticizes us I know we could use a d-ring the problem is we don't have a d-ring so if we had one we would use it but we don't have one so we can't use it so we won't use it but someday we're gonna get one so we can use it I can't decide if this is the most amazing thought I've ever seen or if it's completely useless it's one of the two though it's very very intricate there's a lot of really bad sounds coming out of it that hurts so bad yes I did I took the angle there's a lot of bad sounds coming from this car what was that we're good brakes brakes we got no brakes I'm just kidding look at brakes stop stop using all 700 horsepower are you putting me in traffic right now bro bro what are you this is this is poor technique right now I just like you I'm so I'm sorry wow okay it's different when barlack is telling you burlack is putting you out of business bro you good yeah we're High centered but we're good yeah we're High Center but we're good though we're just not in this pool you got a Hellcat in there yeah we're good we'll send it you know we've seen some excellent driving on the channel but for a Mustang driver that was pretty good that was not bad thank you not I think the knot game we did it but not changed a lot though this is not the same knot we left with I don't know what happened but it worked that was the original Loop we did one Loop that's always that's all he did the other stuff was fluff that's literally just a triangle knob that's all it is yeah it's a triangle knot I made that term up but that's got to be what it's called it's not even a knot come on Oscar do it bud show off for the viewers come on ask Oscar come on that's a good trick yeah you destroyed the paint didn't you buy it that's crazy we've been here in the house since October we've had so many different iterations but this is the first time the 430 challenge has been here in the garage this angle to this perspective on that car is so good imagine if we had that painted purple that would oh whoa imagine imagine wow a lot of purple cars I'm pretty sure on the drive over here I calculated it 14 of my 17 cars are broken broken puffing blue smoke not my car a12 does work razor tip that over not my car not my car the door in the eventual Roadster is broken this car needs a full annual service and the Espada obviously also broken the TRX also works the Gladiator is dead uh smart smart yeah actually the Smart Car Works the Smart car does work well it's been a long arduous day we moved the NASCAR with the Ferrari race car but also we also moved all of these tires right here we got bricks and Forge we've got four footbed tires we got Veyron tires we got Aventador tires we got Hummer tires we've got winter tires for yours we got a Texas Roadhouse sign we got more tires then we know what to do but also you also did not also move all of your tires you have more tires correct there is more tires still at the warehouse we're gonna move those tomorrow but today's video I think on that bombshell the end of the year just like that the end of the era the warehouse is officially gone today's video yep today's video is over [Music]

      "corpus": "I am so glad that you are here joining us for this build series because this car has been 20 years in the making and some cars are just absolute Classics absolute bangers absolute best of all time of their specific era in space and time on the Continuum I would agree with all of that I used to have one of these cars 20 years ago I didn't I wanted to modify it I wanted to make it mad I neither had the friends skills or money to do it at that stage you get all the information off the internet everybody that was on the phones for these cars they're always Stone they didn't even go on car cruises they just smoke a bong and Float home but now all these years later we're doing it properly as weirdly as we can smoking bongs as we don't do that and we're not floating home just yet we're skidding home we're gonna track float home on a cloud of Joy once this build's finished but it's not finished it's just kicking off we really hope you enjoy this build series because we are we are so excited we're so excited so thanks for joining us and enjoy the build of the 180sx thanks if somebody asks you what is the best car in the world you would probably say two-door STI a Volkswagen up and you might be right except you're wrong it's actually an SR20 powered 180sx it's cool this here is going to be the dream build of creating the ultimate 180sx foreign welcome to another episode of Mighty Car Mods now before we kick off people I just want to have a quick chat about some facts and figures and the madness that has been going on in the used car scene now I bought this car in 2019 and I actually think I paid way too much for it I've got the receipt here I bought this car for nine thousand three hundred dollars which is about 1 000 American dollars now even nearly 20 years ago my mates were buying these for nine thousand dollars eight thousand ten thousand dollars kind of the same so pretty much for the last 20 years the price of these has kind of just kind of been going like this and then in the last two years yeah something happened something crazy happened people that I'm calling car gate was that like an EVO leaving a meat it's like a Mustang leaving a meat is the madness that happened with used car prices now there are two 180sx's for sale right now in Australia one of them is a completely munted non-turbo that's had a different engine put in it it's thirty five thousand dollars and then there's another one that's like that that does have an SR20 it is turbine five-speed um and it's like five hundred thousand dollars so what is going on I don't know but it would look like this car which is basically stock and super clean yep well um well yes it's filthy but it's super stock clean from instance don't look too closely we'll we'll fill you in good from afar but far from good um but now because I actually have a history with these cars with s13s non turbo 180s gtas s15s it's now time to actually make the ultimate 180sx the car that I always wanted but couldn't do and now I'm going to do and you know what it's actually not going to be that crazy this is my plan a nice clean streetable 180 SX with 180 kilowatts wrong at the wheels wrong what you put you if you don't make a thousand horsepower you're not really a problem I'm not making a thousand horsepower now how much would this make right now it hasn't been dynoed I don't need to dyno I can tell you it's going to make 110 kilowatts maybe 100 so I'm pretty much going to do the exhaust that makes 128 and then with a boost control it makes 135 and then it goes bang so if you put 91 off I'm aiming for 180 but maybe I'll have a little flicky flick switch there that takes it up to 220 which is kind of what makes it awesome but the goal is 180sx 180 kilowatt we're going 90 style people yeah 90s style so before we jump in let's just show you what we're working with today and then there is a boot full of spare parts and then there is stuff that has been ordered all over the world that is incoming for this car I'm very very excited this is what this is what I'm all about people I mean and and this and yeah and Falafel is good anyway let's have a quick look around the car and then let's dive into the build welcome it's going to be a magical journey it's going to be great come with us it's gonna be awesome magic The Mighty Nissan 180sx is probably my favorite car out of Japan before prices went crazy these were an affordable way to get into modifying Cars track days and drifting with a 2-liter turbocharged rear-wheel drive manual package with a design that has actually stood the test of time this one is quite simply the best condition 180sx I have ever seen and I am going to honor that while also making it my own and building the car that I always wanted as a kid but never did there are a few areas that need some attention most notably under the Bonnet where it looks like we've got a blown turbo so people 180sx you've got a bit of info about it there were about 300 000 at least JDM ones built possibly or some people are actually holding on to them as Collectibles because as years pass and laws change in different countries looking at you America um it's then legal to have them these did go to America in this stage and also these things were built for a whole 10 years even when the next model came out which says a bit about the popularity this is technically a hatchback um but I just want to take you back a bit because I've spent a bit of time in some 180 stock ones modified ones over the years and also back when they weren't cool I mean they were cool because it was a JDM car but they weren't like you know forty thousand dollars plus they were just nuggets that you picked up if you'd upgraded from a Corolla or a pulsar um so firstly stock not that fast yes they make turbo noises yes it's got an SR20 in it but they weren't that fast you weren't really going to beat you know a Skyline or a modified thing rexies would give them a run for their money on the launch back in the day um so really it wasn't this Fantastical magical Driving Experience um can you drift a stock one yeah particularly if you've got one with an LSD in it um they they go sideways well which is kind of partly what made them so popular but everyone modified them now why do they modify them because of the reasons I just said they were kind of a little bit slow they were kind of yeah okay at drifting but you could modify them for cheap and get a huge huge result these days maybe that's not as possible if you go and buy a brand new you know golfer you've got to spend big money and you know it's a big thing to go and go a bit faster with these it wasn't difficult exhaust boost controller and Away you go so that's pretty much what everyone did any 180 that you saw had Wheels coilovers suspension Springs boost controller front mount that's kind of what it had and then The Crazy Ones people would put Skyline engines in them or they would you know build the engines and go stupid with Boost but we didn't have the fuel back in the day to make a thousand horsepower like you can today which is why you see cars doing it Martin you are strumming my skin they were modified weren't they no because that's exactly what I had my 180 yeah it's it's kind of like you've got a Vertex style kit I say vertex style because most people it's like I've got a Vertex kit that they got off missing Soviet no it wasn't it was a Vertex style kit you do a front mount you do an exhaust you do an intake you do some coilovers and off you go I cannot even believe that I'm saying this we are actually cracking out oh we're gonna have a purity I can't even believe it like I can't if you told me 10 15 years ago that you would need a purity box for a 18 SX I would have laughed at you but I know there's some people out there saying stop they should just be stuck the Purity they should never change we never mess with them it's beautiful this is a pretty nice one anyway so yeah it's pretty clean but we are going to feel completely yes we're not going to throw this stuff in the bin we are going to throw anything we pull off and put in the Purity box we're not pulling that much stuff off but we are going to do some tasteful nice modifications just like everyone at ESX in the world has ever had before yes it's going to be good now it's also probably worth saying this car is currently unregistered um my where did my paperwork go you kicked it do you know where I keep you stomped on it 186 Purity box there we go there it is people back to standard if it happens what I don't know why you would but hey it's there at the authorized inspection station 180sx oh fail fail so it failed and then but when you go down to the notes and you go reason for the fail probably not surprising in the best possible result they could be is um the tires were bold on the back and that was probably because this person did a lot of very sensible runs to the shopping center buy their dog food so um there is a whole bunch of stuff in the boot that came with the car we're going to pull it out we're going to see what we've got like I said we've got lots of stuff coming I think we just need to start just exploding it yep getting everything done now we also drove this car we took it around the truck and it was just blowing more blue smoke than its previous owners yeah so um we need to compression test it and then the big exciting thing that's happening is the turbo there is going in the bin in the Purity box oh sorry in the Purity box it's not going in the bin it's going in Purity box so one of the best things about buying a used car like this that is actually something that's quite Niche is it actually came with a couple of boxes of spare parts so we're just going to have a look through and see what we've got uh what it is that we need to keep and what can go in the bin I mean the purity box so I'm gonna put that one there get the Purity box over here and let's just start seeing what we've got so we also need the bin Martin can we please put some of this in the bin yeah oh yes in the bin all right so for example we probably can't put a flare in the bin can we probably go at a boat shop let's see what's going on over here all right so are they coils these are these are like the special yes are they actually all right coils I think they are oh yeah they're basically what you find on Volkswagens but they're good upgrades for SRS awesome that's on the gtir as well great so yeah NGK coils and we have there's four of them which is how many we need so that is good button that's come with one of these what is a 180sx without one of those hang off the bat even though no one couldn't actually travel Japan for years and seen one or used one uh We've also got some stock hoses which is pretty cool so brand new genuine Nissan hoses which is cool I believe that's a battery tray which is cool oh battery support awesome that goes over the top of the hoses another one of these what's that for I know but they're little there's four nuts for something um pit work as well I feel like pit work is JDM well yeah that isn't oil filters yeah you do see them and there's lots of them so either they're planting on lots of oil changes or you've got basically like two years of ownership right there for your Sr Bam Bam box we've done a whole episode on how to install one of those pieces of [\u00a0__\u00a0] and yeah more batteries faced up I don't actually know what that's for someone else oh yes look at this one oh a new shift boot it legit needs one of those that's unreal it's a good mods I believe that's sump plug cable Tire stunt plug I don't know what they are oh some plug washers yes someone cares about this car man what's that oh that's for uh what see I do not know why the car came with this one what is it nice face still don't look yet no it won't hurt you much I don't like it there you go what is it it's a bow time there you go okay fantastic um and little green things I guess they go somewhere and a pit work belt oh that's actually good man that's like a full major service right there that's awesome I believe these things are timing chain so we have to do a timing belt over here is a bit more kind of random stuff uh you've got your bow tie and your tissues there you go um there's a bunch of mounts here uh that's for adjusting coilovers that can probably go I think they're in the bin battery terminals NGK spark plugs just kind of random random things the things that are handy to have all right let's compression test it then let's just pull it apart sure and throw all the old stuff in the bin done so the person in the YouTube comments that was upset that I got rid of my rubber floor mats from my Volkswagen up this is for you and you can get I I was going to use that one and I was going to use that dude no no look what look what is it Nissan motorco March that's not 180 mats wow you chucked them up that is legit worth a lot of money you chucked my floor mats in there they came with this car that is not yours but you can have it that is legit worth money mine what else is in here we got March floor mats with the 180sx that is insane thank you that is insane the comment section now quite liking my mats is it possible that he's here uh for the back of the March uh yeah but look they're pretty like someone's oh it says March it says March it's worth money did you chop these in huh oh wait on that says March dude there's a rare one what are the chances there you go take those I could have used them in my build um and now these ones in the bin March too do the whole boot of floor mats is Nissan much stuff what does that say that says Nissan dude legit that is worth money I'm not even joking yeah it's worth money sick what is this that was in the boot I don't know open it can you open it oh do you know what I think that is I think that is the um that's the sunroof sunroom piece of the I do you do not you don't come on man that never just delete it edit that bit now that we've seen what kind of extra loot we got in the boot when we bought it the first step is to jack up the car and investigate what's going on under the Bonnet the Bonnet is what we call the hood in Australia and we call the trunk the boot and gas we call that petrol because it's not a gas power's in kilowatts measurements in centimeters and shrimps are called prawns damn it and people over revving their Hondas through fart can exhaust we call them [\u00a0__\u00a0] we're removing the spark plugs so we can see what kind of condition they're in and then we're gonna set up for a compression test so because the car's been sitting the battery's a bit tired we are going to put it on charge it's still in good enough condition to keep but I do have a jumper pack on it just because we're going to be cranking we've got our compression tester on cylinder one we're looking for 150 160 but most importantly is consistency along the whole lot so throttle open fuel pump off all the spark plugs out and give it a crank please sir here we go yep 160. 160. yep so this one's 160. and smell old fuel we go ahead and test all four cylinders and they're looking healthy at 160 PSI I just want to highlight how good the interior is of this 180sx a lot of the time when you get these cars there's kind of holes in the dash from where people in Japan have put gauges and all sorts of random accessories and stuff this is so clean it is I mean I've never seen anything like it the doors the carpets the handles there's no cracking on it there's no stains or marks on it it's just it's amazing so pumped so as part of our mild modifications we are going to do a coil upgrade we're doing that because we are also going to go to an aftermarket ECU to give us a bit more control and also give us the ability to do that now this Factory coils are known for cracking and sure enough even that first one has a giant crack the whole way down here and it just it just makes them misbehave it's sort of a common fix so back in the day you could just put replacement coils as aftermarket options as well we're going to go for an even more modern coil that does require an aftermarket ECU to run it so all this is going to get disconnected and pulled off we just make a new little sub Loom that goes from here into the new coils three out of four yeah that one cylinder four straight down there yep it's under three two survived somehow probably because they've got probably because that one got replaced yeah back when I had my 180 when I was young um every few months or something it felt like you had to change these because I could never afford to change all four of them at once so your cards start running terribly you replace one of them uh basically you know unplugging and plugging them in again to try and work out which one it was and then you replace that one and then a few months later you're doing another one and it's just it's just heat and age these are like right down in the top of the rocker cover and they get hot and they get old and brittle technology has advanced though so the new ones that are in there should last forever do you know where these ones can go Martin absolutely they can so I'm moving the intercooler piping so we can access the turbo I'm going to remove that because that one there is going in the bin and dirty box what in the Purity box sorry it's going into the Purity box uh and we have got a JDM S15 T28 brand new uh on its way which hopefully will be here soon so nothing too unexpected under here it does have aircon but there's no belt on it and there's a lot of grease and crud on the wheel which makes me think it hasn't been on there for a while a lot of oil on the sump but generally that's coming from somewhere else some people look at the sump and go oh I've got an oil leak down low usually it's up top and it's running down to the sump and just covering everything got a rear main seal leak as well that can end up with a slipping clutch so I think we will replace a clutch in this did you say there's some leaks under this 180sx one um and the other thing that's good to replace as well if you don't know how long it's been done is rocker cover because a lot of the time just the smallest rocker cover leak can drip down and just cause an absolute mess so I don't know where else Sylvia's leak from but rear main certainly and rocker cover certainly and there's quite a few over on the this side where the alternator is so we're going to fix all that because we should because it's a mad car needs to be fixed next up I'm going to spray all the old uh nuts and bolts with some WD-40 specialist penetrant it's a good idea to do this first uh get under here spray it all do other stuff do we've got to do give it time to get in there and then you can release it the dump pipe bolts and the ones on the back of the turbo and the exhaust are notorious for being Rusty and gross on pretty much all cars so I'm going to just spray every bolt in that whole setup and then come back later with some long spanners and attempt to crack them without breaking stuff we need to access the turbo so the next thing to come off the car is the exhaust this this is made easier by spraying some of the rubber exhaust hangers with WD-40 silicon spray and then removing each section while this car may still have decent levels of Purity it doesn't mean it's all in good condition so you can see also from up here that some of these hoses are starting to crack as well so we're obviously going to be replacing all of this with a new piping kit but these are kind of some of the things that you wouldn't normally see particularly a crack like this which is going to be hidden underneath these hose clamps so all of that stuff is going in the Purity bin box the next thing to come off is the front bar so we've got better access and so we can remove the factory side mounted intercooler we are keeping these SSR wheels for now so that it's easy to move the car around but eventually we will replace them with something else so we took our spark plugs out to do our comp test we are going to throw a new set of NGK bkr6e plugs in that is the one that is uh usually recommended on the factory listing for an SR20 a lot of people go to sevens you're chasing a lot more power we're not chasing a lot more power uh these will be totally fine for our purpose so we're going to put them in just so nothing Falls in there we are probably going to read a rocker cover gasket but that doesn't affect the spark plug so I'm just going to wind them straight back in standard spark plugs like these ones have a useful service life of somewhere between 20 and 40 000 K's that's going to be less in an engine that's tuned for more power or being tracked and thrashed more modern cars often use iridium or platinum tips in the center and ground electrode which can go upwards of a hundred thousand K's before needing replacement the front bar is ready to come off and go straight into the bin except it doesn't fit I've got another front bar to go on which is an upgrade that I'll be showing you as the build progresses but for now we've finally got access to the turbo so it's time to get it gone all right this has been released from its prison oh there it is please take it mate it's all yours should be disconnected hopefully something down there trick is to take the manifold off with all the lines still attached all right there you go let's have a look at what we've got here Martin so this here is the factory turbo off the 180sx uh which is around 30 years old yeah the 90s was that long ago the car's also done around 110 000 K's according to the dash but it is an import and it's possible that there was some sneaky shimming in going on somewhere so maybe it's done 150 160 hundred and eighty thousand K's so that there is going to be replaced with a new turbo that is going to be due here soon which I'm going to go through with you which is very very exciting but for now this one here which we intuitively think there's something wrong with because it was blowing a lot of smoke this one here can just go in the bin so the factory turbo is now gone uh the front bar is off which is going to give us access to the side mount intercooler which is literally about this big now I know there are going to be some Purity police out there but we are increasing the Boost and I want to put a front mount on there and I've already bought it and already paid for it plus they look mad they do they do look good so that is coming so I'll get rid of the piping and the actual core of that uh what about you Martin so we also noticed when we drove at the track that the suspension was a bit sort of clunky and thrashed it does have aftermarket coilovers in it but these are meant to be rebuilt um occasionally when they wear them out if especially if you're in a hard time doing skids so we think these are a bit we're out but we've actually got some others that we want to put in that should make the ride Bellissimo yeah um so we're probably going to swap them out these ones are going in the bin the other thing as well is this has the s13 turbo brakes which is I understand it a single pot calipers um very typical of what you'd see on a base model Subaru Impreza or a pulsar like they're just a bit bigger but there's nothing particularly flash about them so there are a number of break upgrades you can do on these including 300ZX calipers and calipers from other Nissan's GTR brakes gtst brakes stuff like that you have to dial it in with how many studs you got and we're staying four stud so we're going to try and find ourselves a little break nice Factory suite upgrade it was a very common thing to do back in the day to do a five stud conversion because then you've got way more options for wheels and things like that but I'm I'm straddling the Purity fence it's like part of me wants to make the car way better which we're going to do the other part of me wants to kind of relive my youth of having a 180 so there's certain things that I want to do that may not make sense to everyone but they make sense to me you know what I mean I just want to keep it four-starred until I realize there aren't enough Wheels available and then I'll be back here telling you why it's a really got a good idea to change the fight if you can find four stud wheels and you can fit your brakes you don't there's no other huge benefit for something making 200 kilowatts anyway um yeah anyway so look this suspension is coming out which is easy on this car uh we'll take the brakes off and then I'm going to start dismantling the rear of the car because we've got some changes happening back there as well I'm refreshing my memory of pulling apart the rear of a 180sx by watching a video of me pulling apart the rear of a 180sx on YouTube that we made many years ago all of this stuff is going in the bin I mean the Purity box and we're going to be upgrading the back with a Type X cookie rear conversion all the factory boost control is coming out along with the aftermarket boost control system which is in there so we're just going to replace it with a new Mac valve you can recycle that kind of stuff but it's often a good idea for the money is to play it safe with one that you know works so that's going to come out we might reuse that mounting system we'll get some new hoses on there as well and throw this all in the Purity box what are they in the Purity box I mean yeah is that a cocky rear end and one's a kooky one's a bookie and a schmooky isn't that what you call it all those words make me feel a bit weird people call them I've got a schmooky kook MR2 do ya yeah good for you man all right in the bin 30 bucks people and I'm gonna buy an MR2 with it what stop it don't put on the bin dude no it's not it's like we're doing a kooky conversion sorry I can't even say I didn't mean I can't even say that no we had to cover you with a goat what is it don't talk it's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] Martin don't talk you wasting something I'm not putting them in there put them in the Purity box that's what I'm storing them in there until you can have a pure shitty looking 180 using those lights I'm just storing them in there until the bin gets taken just one just put in there why are you so upset about set the internet just be cool I'm destroying your car so you should do what the internet is [Music] next up it's time to remove the coilovers which should be a simple and quick process but due to one of these bolts being completely thrashed it's taking way longer and is way smokier than it should be foreign [Music] again [Music] next up I can remove the tiny Factory side mount intercooler [Music] all right [Music] y people here's where we're at front bar in the bin intercooler bin intercooler piping in the bin turbocharger bin exhaust in the bin wheels and tires spin Brakes in the bin suspension bin rear lights in the bin Santa garnish spin oh make it stop did I forget anything Martin I don't know but by bin we mean Purity box we don't actually mean the bin for most of the items that he just rattled off no Purity box you know what I love about this things like the power steering and the belts and all the other stuff that are really boring to fix and modify they all work really well and everything's really clean we slap some injectors in this we slap an ECU in this we slap an exhaust and a mad turbo on it yeah and we're good man it's going to be great excellent so we've been doing lots of ordering online and a massive box has arrived with a bunch of random stuff so we've got a uh it's a water line kit we've got some dampers for the Bonnet like different struts so you get rid of that which kind of makes it cooler that one there I'll show you that in a minute that I'm very very excited about um boot kit because they're rooted oil filter we did already get some of these with the car but they are there that's a fuel filter that one is some what's in there ah NGK iridium spark plugs which is cool uh and then we have for the proper old school we've got a bullet front mount intercooler kit that's in that oh that's I think um oh rocker cover gasket man that's good in here we have let's have a little look all of this will be going on I gather this is probably parts for the front mount intercooler kit which is yep hoses clamps stuff like that and then in here ah turbo gasket I think some of them are going to be coming with the turbo anyway and then Here We Go the actual core for the front mount look at that you know that's just going to be you know it's going to be ah adjust your pants everyone so that's that now Martin's going to show you some chisel and then I'm going to show the turbo I also have some amazing modifications to unbox which I'm going to show you and then we're going to smash them into the vehicle the first is a set of shock Works coilovers which are made specifically for this 180sx we're also able to specify oh cool shirts we're also able to specify um what damping rate we want it on the Springs as well to kind of keep it nice and streetable which is important I think because you put really really stiff coil levels in the street car you run it and then you never want to drive it we want the opposite effect with this so there is some very sweet looking shocks work coilovers now a lot of the people that make this kind of stuff shot works are a good example you just talk to them first and you say what this is what I want to do with the car this is how I'm going to use it and then they can sort of give you some advice on what weight spring and the valving for inside the shock itself so that's mad it's got a full set of coilovers to suit our four stud vehicle the other handling mods we have as well is a bunch of white line gear which is pretty cool this is a sway bar kit specifically for the 180 or so so we've got heavy duty sway bar links and front and rear sway bars just show you because they're freaking awesome these are also adjustable so you can fine tune your suspension by fine tuning how stiff the sway bar is or where you mount it which sort of changes the way that it behaves which is excellent so we have our handling mods which is our coilovers and our sway bars like that get around the diff and get around the exhaust Etc which is pretty awesome so throw them on replaces the factory ones and then excitingly also coils I spoke about last time this is what's really cool though this is a a coil fitting kit so this helps adapt the Volkswagen style NGK coils to our Nissan now you can get ones for various Nissan vehicles s13 S4 ms-15 and the only thing that changes is the plug on the end so what's cool about that is that now plugs directly in which means you don't have to make your own Loom and then this end plugs into your cart now because we are going to be adding a aftermarket ECU in the form of a haltech elite uh we'll change this plug because we've got to run wires up from the ECU up to here so we can do sequential ignition injection all that sort of stuff which is pretty much that's a loom we got from vag parts and this is the last and exciting part as well is our haltech Elite and Associated bits we've also got a plug-in adapter so we can plug directly into the factory Looms in good condition so why wouldn't you boost control solenoid as well which you spoke about last time and then we've got our haltech Elite 1000 I believe this is no 1500 cool there's a haltek elite 1500 which you could convert that to ease throttle if you wanted to but we're not going to today and we also have our wide band which means the car is constantly sniffing its exhaust to making sure everything's working and there's no pingers going on like that so that's all the stuff we're going to throw in it looks like a lot but this is all like relatively easy and bolting which is very very cool we also have a clutch in case the car ends up needing that which it probably will and we've got a new radiator over here so that is going in just to uh make sure the car actually runs at the correct temperatures because it's still other than one or two laps that's done at the track where it's just blue blue smoke everywhere we're not really sure what our state everything is in and then we have over here our turbo which I'm not even going to unbox until it's ready to actually put that on because I'm just I'm trying to delay the gratification and excitement just a little bit because there is so much mad stuff to go on the car so what has changed a little bit between now and like 20 years ago and you modded on the same mods is just a replacement radiator probably would have been over two grand for something that's like custom made now this stuff's been around for so long there's been so much r d so much development processes have gotten cheaper you can get mods and do all this stuff with awesome new gear for a lot cheaper than it used to be absolutely and so when I had my 180sx back in the I guess early 2000s a front mount kit installed on your car was around two and a half thousand dollars absolute Madness now you can buy a front mount like a really good quality one for five six hundred bucks 700 bucks anyway let's jump in let's run the music let's do this modifying cars doesn't always mean more power even though it usually kinda does it also means making the car run better and more reliably and one often overlooked issue here is cooling it is hot in Australia for most of the Year winter usually only requires some Woolen undies and a hot water bottle to get through and it barely gets into the single digits so we have some mad new parts to go in to help with cooling but first we need to clean up the dirty mess this Nissan has ejected out all over itself so if you need to measure some stuff up uh make sure you check out the all-new black Mighty Car Mods tape measure while many parts of the car will remain pure there is one piece that's about to get chopped and that's the battery tray to make way for the cold side piping of the new front mounted intercooler there are some measurements available in Japanese and using a translator helps us get a basic idea of what to do once the hole's been chopped I'll be keeping the spirit of Nissan Alive by painting the exposed edges with 240Z white left over from our Fair Lady RV project with the radiator out and everything else out of the way this is the best possible time to do some belts and our previous owner has very kindly supplied us with the belt so I'm going to rip off these old ones they look not great and uh replace them this 180 has some serious oil leaks it appears to not just be engine oil but power steering fluid as well and the aircon looks pretty sad I'm going to clean up the pulleys and replace the shagged belts and then clean everything down so I can try and identify exactly where these leaks are coming from meanwhile I'm getting our new front mounted intercooler installed [Music] everything I should [Music] while we're up the front of the car we're installing our new black alloy radiator these are affordable offer better Cooling and don't have 30 year old plastic end tanks that can blow off while you're waiting for your drive-through slop dropping on me [Music] [Applause] [Music] push me harder [Music] for any Purity police now would be a good time to look away from the screen I need to make some minor adjustments with an angle grinder yes angle grinder and minor are not words that are usually associated with each other but in this case some trimming is required to fit in around the new intercooler longer a fuel pump upgrade is one of the first mods you should consider when going for more power a consistent fuel supply means less chance of detonation and stable mixtures good quality aftermarket pumps are cheap these days but beware of going too big and trying to flow more fuel than the rest of the system can accommodate that usually causes more problems than it fixes now because Nissan love car enthusiasts they made it really easy to change the fuel pump in a water nesx you pop the boot lid you pull out the plate at the bottom of the boot and You Yank it out this is the original fuel pump looks very similar to the MR2 one of a similar era that I pulled out once and similar to the super turbo one funnily enough that's the cradle that it goes into now we're going to put a new fuel pump in it is possible to over pump your car you base it on the power figure that you're chasing we know we're going for 180 to 200 kilowatts we don't need a huge pump that's a raceworks e85 compatible pump as well we're going to put that in so a little adaption happens it comes with a bunch of fittings and rubbers and stuff to try and help make it work because this works with a multitude of different fuel hangers I'm going to pop that in and we'll have all the fuel supply that we need there's often a variety of housings and brackets that you can install your pump onto if you can get a specific drop-in kit for your car with everything done that will make things easier if you're customizing it make sure the pickup point and filter sock are in the same position as the original then make sure it's firmly secured and always use new hose that's submersible if it's inside the tank so the front man in the cooler is in the piping is in the radiator is in we have a massive list of things to do of which only three things have been written off how are you going exactly right fuel pumps in as well which is a big one because we didn't need all that and this all had to happen first so there's a few things still to happen with turbos and ecu's and other fun things we actually don't have our injectors yet so we're waiting for some new injectors and then we'll be able to slap that in as well and we're actually believe it or not not that far from just turning the key I know it doesn't look like it but it is a pleasure to work on this nugget isn't it if you've got an old nugget like this guess what it's worth more than 33 dollars now I bought this for nine thousand dollars but its value has gone through the roof Shannon's is a sponsor of our show and all of our cars are insured with them and when this is on the road registered and rolling around it is also going to be in short with Shannon's um they do agreed value so if you like me have bought a car for 3.50 and now because of the crazy second-hand prices that are going around it's gone up um give Shannon's a call and um and adjust your adjust your um value you'll end up speaking to someone who knows about cars so if you go I've got a 180 they'll know right away why you're calling and it won't be because you blew it up yeah it'll be because the value has gone up and it's worth updating every single year injectors need to arrive if we can change them fuel pressure regulator as well then we slap our turbine and how taken we Plumb everything we plug it in we fill it full of coolant we change all the fluids yes and our exhaust actually looks pretty good really good um I'm just trying to work out whether to go full me 20 years ago Canon or the twin tip I just I don't know what do you think what do you think man twin tips there's nothing wrong with the big cannon either Martin that's true um even though you know you if if you if it's too loud you're too old man that's definitely true all right all right let's um let's kick on I just want to let everyone know because I think it's important that this 180 is bloody excellent it's so good it's so good man I mean except for the enormous gigantic hit it's had on the front that probably bent one chassis rails into the other it hasn't been hit at all in stats so bad no it hasn't but it's a nice car that's been stacked that's been looked after all the parts are really nice nothing's Rusty in my wanted it's just really good man it's very happy even better now if you didn't already what is the plan for this car a 180sx with 180 kilowatts of the wheel which is about 80 more urban Mr Drifter is meant to come with um today it's getting a new turbo now we don't need a massive turbo because we're only aiming for 180 kilowatts of the wheels which is not a huge amount of power but it's actually going to be a really good amount of power for this to be a fun street car and get me back to my youth people so we are replacing the Shag Factory Turbo with a T28 ball bearing turbo this is from a JDM S15 random fact I ordered this um from high school and the guy rang me and said do you know who I am and I said no but I hope you're going to send me a turbo and he said I was the one that helped you rebuild the turbo for your Miss Daisy project which was our SDI engine in the back of the beetle that you can see up there small world now here it is this is exciting now if you're going to replace something Marty's in My Philosophy as always try and replace it with something better if you're going to go to all the effort of taking it out and redoing it you may as well so I could have got something the same as what was in there or tried to rebuild it but if you can go better go better now Martin do you want to bring that one over and we'll have a look the biggest difference I can see so far look how much bigger the wastegate actuator is compared to that one and importantly the front housing massive difference so much size difference but it uses the same plan so they say T28 because this flange here is the same which means you can use it on our stock manifold which is a low Mount setup so the other option is that flips the other way and you have it sitting up nice and high and proud but this can retains the uh the stock positioning which also means we can use these lines so someone's put aftermarket lines on the turbo for cooling and oil we'll be able to reuse all that now I know some people you know want to make a million horsepowers for their youtubing and their views and all that other stuff but ultimately that stuff can often lead to a sacrifice in the actual enjoyment and drivability of the car we've experienced it by making cars that have too much power or kind of same core on the internet but they're not that cool like a Mark III golf which is one of our most viewed videos ever that thing was a piglet to drive yeah and just you know and the police would pull you over every time you went out cool for what it was but this here is meant to be a nice car that you can drive regularly that makes good power and is fun enough to do a bunch of different stuff forbearing has a reputation for spooling up a bit quicker and we're just going sort of like a little bit bigger but not heat because if you put a massive turbo on a silver or an Sr with an SR20 in it you get a Dyno curve that just goes certain right at the end and makes heaps of power but otherwise sucks to drive on the road so this is all about mid-range and just being able to punch the throttle it responds and it goes and while there are sometimes recipes of what turbos work in different configurations we know that this one here is going to work because this is a factory delivered turbo on an SR20 for a more recent model S15 so we know it's going to work so today we're getting the turbo going uh we're also getting our coilovers we want to get the car rolling again yeah so that's happening um some brakes I also bought uh some seats off Facebook marketplace now I'll show you these in a little while all you need to know is just to remind you the car costs nine thousand dollars and so did the seats not quite but I mean I mean almost I mean it's it's when the seats cost almost as much as the car you know we're in crazy times when it comes to secondhand Goods people absolutely crazy times so goals so far uh get the turbo on get the coilovers on you've probably seen by now that we've opened a new workshop called Super Garage um so why aren't we using the Hoist because we was at that project and that plays up so other projects there's an RX7 in there there's two other cars in there and we've got some friends in there that are doing their project because workshops are like Utes everyone wants to use them so we put a lot of time and money into setting up that space and today we will be on our backs again in here as we have it for the last seven years it'll be fine all right let's get to it this Factory turbo has been spinning away furiously for almost three decades and I'm stoked to be replacing it with something brand new that's capable of making even more power but everything is Rusty and rounded off and that means everything takes longer than it should so this particular nut here on the manifold is already rounded over most of them look like they're fairly thrashed I actually can't get that one off I'm going to use some of the WD-40 specialist penetrant fast release and just let that soak in and just give it a little bit more and then focus on another one I don't want to leave that one to last because as Marty says if you leave the hardest one to last it'll be even harder so there is one more to get to which is under the line so I'm just going to leave that to soak in for a little bit take this off and then we'll get back to that hopefully I can separate them without using an angle grinder yourself [Music] when we pull this apart I noticed all the breathing stuff was a little bit smashed like the hoses were unhappy and just cracked and not great so what we've done is we're going to use a different solution for this catch can this is like a factory catch canister thing which is cool but it's kind of in the way of the exhaust manifolds a bit messy and there's heaps of cool aftermarket options out there like this one which is from GK Tech which is an Aussie company and they've made this awesome catch can that actually sits in the spot where your intercooler pipe used to go so once you've got a front mount you can then put this tank in which sits there which looks super neat and it's a really quick and easy run of hoses straight from the outlet here into the tank and then back out again so that's a mad solution looks cool black matches just a bit neater the car is really starting to come together in that mad OEM plus look that I'm going for we've done so much already but there is still so much to do all right that catch can is installed we'll do the hoses once the turbo's in there we also just found out that our side fit injectors are actually back ordered and we can't get them for months so instead we're going to do a top feel top feed rail conversion that's on its way now from Interstate and we'll be able to slap some injectors in with the catch can installed I'm removing anything from the factory turbo that needs to be transplanted over to the new unit [Music] so I've attached the manifold to the turbo everything that looks like it's been set up properly and now um we can boost his calling what's it saying Martin it shows you it's time to begin your journey great let's you're right yep I mean I'm working on a Nissan so as alright as you can be yes we're at that most exciting part of the build where we're installing the turbocharger that magical mystical mysterious and magnificent device that makes everything marvelous except it doesn't fit so the turbo that was already on the car came with this kind of aftermarket hose kit I've reinstalled that in the exact same configuration that it was on the factory turbo but it just seems to be fouling here on the stem of the wastegate actuator so I'm just going to take that off and see if we can kind of maneuver it in a way that's going to make it fit better in the car all right take two reconfigured some of these lines and now let's uh see how we go getting it into place it is pretty common for the factory oil and water lines to fail after lots of thrashing or lots of Turbo swaps it's worth remembering most of this stuff was only ever warranted for three years and when now 10 times that and it's still going strong these aftermarket Replacements are durable but have their own issues of rubbing through things they shouldn't with so many different bits to attach to our spoolie boy we're going to leave it all loose make sure the threads are engaged properly and then tighten it down till it's happy and check it all with a torque wrench [Music] brake caliper upgrade options are limited when you stay with the four start hubs so we're going to stick with the factory brakes for now I'm going to clean up all the old Gunk check the seals and repaint them for an extra 25 kilowatts we'll install brand new upgraded discs and pads as well as new brake lines which should give good pedal feel and good stopping power for our desired power level thank you okay people so it always takes a little bit longer to get things done than you think it's going to get done particularly when things don't always work in their initial configuration and they almost never work in their initial configuration when a car's dissolved bolt on um but the turbo is now mounted manifold is done so that part of it is done except for the drain of the turbo which is not right so it seems to be a different size I don't know if they changed it I'm not aware of it they did but if we need to get a different part it's just the bit that bolts onto the bottom of the turbo and turns from a two bolt into a hose to go back into the sump yeah now we also ordered some more brakes and stuff so we haven't ended up getting the coilovers done today because we're just gonna have to take them out again anyway because there's still a bit of stuff that has to be done up here so basically we want to do that and the brakes and wheels and tires all in one go and the calipers have been fully stripped and blown apart cleaned up they're in really good condition which is awesome don't need a full rebuild all the boots look really good just going to clean it paint them up so they look cool and then uh yeah use that with our new rotors which will get the sort of best we can get with the factory brakes because we're staying four starred it limits you to what brake which you can do so these are fine especially if you upgrade your rotors and pads and make sure your calipers are good we'll put some braided lines on it so it's gonna be good back in the day people did do five side conversions it was a really common modification people did I didn't do that for my massive 16 uh 16 inch wheels but um the parts were just not available we did explore that option but it makes finding Wheels uh really tricky so at least just to get things moving around for now we might end up with these painted or I might just have to buy some cheap wheels off the net until we get something from Japan I'm not sure yet but we will get something just to put on there it may not be the classiest most fancy wheel or the best option but it'll just be enough for us to roll the car around because at some point we've got to do a clutch as well there's just there's lots of things we've also got injectors on the way too so yeah a few deliveries still to come but all fun stuff to put on we've decided to rebuild the factory brakes which should be fine for now for our 180sx with 180 kilowatts Marty's also given them a coat of heat proof red paint and we've got a whole video on how to do this if you want to check it out meanwhile I'm working in the boot trying to get out the existing coilovers which is proving to be harder than expected so I've managed to get one knot off in the back of this 180sx that's drop man [Laughter] um which is a 12 mil but my 12 mils Mana Now does not fit on the other nut so why is it when someone's installed the coilovers only two nuts are required why would they be different and why this one here is okay the other one is just completely rounded over why you don't need to do them that tight I don't understand [Music] the car came with coilovers of unknown conditions so we're going to flip them and install a set of new ones we've also got some mad new slotted brake discs for the front and the back which along with a pad upgrade will be perfect for this level of performance and means we don't have to mess around with the master cylinder or the booster we're installing a set of shock Works coilovers that we've had made specifically for this build that have been valved and sprung to suit how we want the car to handle it is possible to ruin a car's ride if you get the specs really wrong so it pays to do some research first in our case with this car now being a classic we've gone for a setup that's good for 80 Pace foremost to enjoy the Driving Experience we're running 7 kilo and four kilo Springs and one of 15 different valve specs to specifically suit s13 for Street driving but for a sometimes track car like this there is enough flexibility in the built-in adjustment to have a bit of fun only if we went up in a tire size or in full race car would we need to pull it all out and rebuild to suit higher speed and bigger tires so before we put the new brakes on uh we're just cleaning up the Hub and just getting rid of all the grease and grime and grot that's on there of course to clean the brakes by using WD-40 special as brake cleaner that's exactly what this is made for so we're basically going to give it a good Shake soak all of that up and then I'm going to agitate it with a wire brush got a little pan to sit underneath so just catch all of the grot and then that'll be nice and clean for our new brake upgrade after my big battle with the original Factory bolt I've decided to install an adjustable camber bolt kit at the top white line make this one it gives you up to one and a half degrees camber adjustment at the bottom of the Hub sometimes you also have adjustment on the top of your coilover and you can also actually use both just a fine tune it to get the angle right and to get your alignment perfect [Music] it's important that new discs are cleaned before you install them as they often come from the manufacturer covered in a form of oil to prevent them corroding on the Shelf we'll be installing some braided lines when they finally arrive I'm also going to touch up some bits that I mangled when I was installing the calipers we have made some progress people we've got our list and we've we've just added five items and we're probably only going to cross off one or two but I feel like we've made progress even if the list does not agree it was meant to be a fairly simple project really it was meant to be simple it was meant to be it I I don't want it to turn into yellow Civic don't worry that'll never happen again coilovers coilover's done done they're in there break up with paint done rotors and pads done all of that still to do well that's still to do so some of this stuff is going to be much easier to do on a hoist like changing the clutch so we're going to head over to Super Garage to do that and also our sway bars yeah as you may have seen in some of our other videos now we have a secondary overflow Workshop uh which is called supergo with a hoist so we are still Mighty camels this is the mighty car mod space there's just a garage that's kind of a collaborative space that our friends are using as well um so we'll have to go over there today and try and get ourselves onto our own hoist sounds good to me um but it means that we can now get on a horse and do some of this stuff we could struggle on here but why when we can just go over there and do that there's also some things that like for example our turbo is on so we could put our exhaust back on but you've got to pull the exhaust off any way to do the clutch if that's going to stay off for a little while wheels are still on their way brakes are done no point bleeding that either until we can also get that on a horse we can gravity bleed it and we can check everything and just flush it all out and do some of our oils yeah so all of this stuff here um that there we're gonna pack up in the truck and take over there and there's also so if you just swing it over here we've got some seats there coming soon and then all of this this is all um mostly genuine Nissan stuff that has come from overseas so all of that's got to go in as well um and then there's a new front bar as well and um yeah all sorts of exciting things in here that we'll get to soon so anyway for now we're going to take it down off the quickjacks and take the car over to the super garage and continue on the Hoist [Music] thank you so this here is our all-new Workshop Super Garage where we go when things get a bit too complicated or not enough hoisty at the other place there's a whole bunch of Super Garage merch if you want to check it out you can go to supergarage.com and you know what let's just get crazy if you enter the coupon code 180sx you get a discount sweet call it 10 off you can grab yourself a shirt or something mad alright so now we can get on the Hoist becomes a whole lot easier the back's too low to get on the Hoist so we have to jack it up because we didn't adjust the coilovers Martin what would you have though I mean that you've got two you've got two mad white Nissans right here yeah what would you have um it's not a hard Choice out of these two wonderful hard decision out of these two white cards that are over here see these two white Nissans because I'm just distracted by this blue Coupe from the 80s it's just so sick and triangly and doritoy I mean the choice is I mean which one would you have Mountainside on three one two three one adsx it's not what people want to hear it's not what the internet thinks that is a whole generation older and feels it when you drive it but it's about the feel and the spirit and it's about the the noise and the visceral emotional intentionally said with an RB don't listen to any of this [\u00a0__\u00a0] what but this is actually the answer is both yeah both as long as it's not a rotary I'm in you I agree with that while we're on the Hoist I'm gonna be changing all the fluids including the engine oil which hasn't been done in years we're also going to be installing some more handling mods which means the factory sway bar can go in the bin thank you [Music] now we're up on the horse perfect opportunity to upgrade our sway bars now white line who are a sponsor of the show have sent a bunch of parts to basically modernize the sway bars that's on our car the 180 designed in the probably early to mid 80s did come with Factory sway bars which is pretty cool the ones that we're putting on basically mirror them but they're also adjustable which means you can fine tune the way it behaves it also comes with a mounting kit which is pretty extensive actually heavy duty new rubbers that go through the middle as well and then this basically converts it so that you can use a blade type adjustable sway bar which looks like this so the factory one the mounts come up the bottom just sort of bends around and whatever the bushes are a bit cracked so these kind of need to be changed anyway this sway bar we are basically adapting it so that you can select the different holes in here and that changes how rigid the bar is which changes the way that the car responds so during alignment or even just when you're out in the truck whatever you can get in there just take one bolt out throw it through the next one put it back in and you've been able to fine tune the way it behaves usually to do with oversteer and understeer so a sway bar is a part of a suspension setup that is designed to connect both sides of the car together to provide some rigidity so that when the car is turning instead of tipping over the opposite side of the car is actually working in harmony with the side that wants to tip over now with a four-wheel drive for example like when we're off-road with the chimney we actually wanted the two sides of the car to be operating independently so we took the sway bar out completely why would you change it to offer some more rigidity and also with aftermarket ones you actually get uh different options of how it's set up and some adjustability like on these white light ones so the classic wave upgrading use brakes sway bars is just to get the factory right and just put a bigger one on so it's just actually fatter mount's in the same spot but it's bigger diameter which means it's stiffer which means it has more of an effect so these ones are called blade adjustable which means you can just change where it's mounted and that in some ways lets it sort of artificially increase the diameter of the bar because it just it's all stiffer so you mount with the hole close to the bar that's going to make it stiffer and further away is going to make it a bit looser you adjust it front to back to sort of dial in what you want the car to do you also don't have to have coilovers you don't have any fancy suspension in the car you can literally get a stock car sway bars and some good tires and there's people that will just pump everyone with that set up because it just stops it stops IT rolling dials in in the understeer out of the understeer whatever it is you want and just go smash everyone and I think like uh with a lot of modifications for the car it always comes down to working out a ratio or a bias based on what your interests are I mean you can make a track car that is great for the track but then maybe there's a downside of that and the Lotus was a really good example you know really great on the track but not a great car for just kind of driving around day to day the other reason for changing this stuff is that underneath this car all of these kind of mounts the bushings this stuff's like 30 35 years old and if nothing else it's a great opportunity to change all of those things but our philosophy is always if you're going to pull the stuff off you might as well replace it with something better which is what we're going and if you can't get these parts for your car replace those because a lot of they're common or you can get them remade in the same if you've got something really weird and rare that doesn't have aftermarket stuff replace those bushings because they get real stiff and then sort of stop doing what they're meant to do while the car's on the Hoist we also decided to install a new clutch and get rid of any old juice that's been sloshing around for years after going to the effort of removing the gearbox it actually looks like somebody's already installed a new clutch with next to no use so it can all go back together with some new gearbox oil the end links connect the sway bar to the rest of the suspension and in the case of our upgraded ones they are adjustable it means you can set the preload during an alignment and this usually means relaxing the bar so it doesn't actually activate until you load it up through a corner in terms of initial settings to get it to the alignment shop we want to match the factory positioning as much as we can and with the end links in place we can then install the mounting bushings and we're all done pretty much everything you can see in the background there with the exception of maybe the laptop on the drink bottle have to go in the car before it starts yeah but we have some things to go in like a fuel system up here some ignition coils over here some intake piping some intercooler piping incontinence injectors kind of not much actually it's actually not that much and this is fun because we're going to make it all work let's let's dude it's we've got let's call it for what it is we've got this we've got injectors we've got coils we've got intake there's some turbo bits there's exhaust there's our haltech that's actually going to make it work we've got no fuel we just checked if we were professional this would have a thing on it that says no oil you know they always get a little brown tag with a bit of string that's not on there at least these are done up I call that Hilux tight 90s nugget is your middle name don't worry about it anyway we've got what I can I'm getting soup Keen I can't assure you but actually I can't assure you that it's going to start because yeah but it's got a new that's why we're doing all of this work but there's nothing better than putting a new turbo yes that's right and so that's what we think was wrong with it we don't actually know no idea it hasn't been started or driven for years I mean years so we could get through all of this turn the key and it just goes and then we just get back to Volkswagen up we just get back to stuff that work no this is this is way better than us I'm not even gonna I'm not even gonna shoot with that this is this is actually where it's at bloody we're going for a massive 180 kilowatts Martin let's let's just keep the tunes what kind of tunes do you want uh I want you want some hip-hop you want some EDM you want some DNB some jungle I want idiom DMB all right let's kick it let's get some work done to my mad 180. in the late 80s there would have been a whole bunch of business meetings involving sake and crab to wheel and deal an injection and ignition system for this car from the various suppliers around Japan this in themselves would respect what they wanted and then the accounts Department would have torn it up and given them side feed injectors and coils that always crack fast forward 30 years and we have an enormous aftermarket and technology that can make Power reliably that those Engineers could only have dreamed of back in the day so we're gonna throw in a set of top feed injectors into a new fuel rail at a gfb pressure regulator and then set the whole lot on fire with a set of NGK coil packs Spectra and Audi R8 that makes somewhere upwards of 400 kilowatts importantly it's all new with zero kilometers on it meaning reliable power with plenty of Headroom to turn it up later so gfb in Australia have sent me a box full of stuff for my mad 180sx so in here we have a what is this a boost gauge I didn't even know they made boost gauges they've been sponsors of our show for like a decade I didn't know that they made boost cages but look at that it's like one of the mad like it's all blacked out and then when you turn it on it's going to light up and be unreal that's really cool we'll run that definitely I've got a bunch of fittings in here we have a it's probably a fuel pressure oh it is fuel pressure gauge here and some Associated fittings uh and then of course oh here it is this is what we're all about this is the uh I mean you would have seen these on the show gfb they're the best ball valves in the world they just are we've used them forever designed and made in Australia by our mate Brett we've actually got a whole series on our second Channel MCM TV2 where he comes and does a bunch of technical videos about boost leaks and smoke tests and all sorts of really technical interesting stuff so I'll link that up there I'll link it down below this here of course is a valve that I've used in so many different cars because it has this awesome uh bias so you can either vent all the way out the snorkel or you can kind of recirculate it or a bicep anywhere in between that is awesome and there's a bunch of fittings and other bits and pieces in here that's unreal thank you for sending that over um let's keep going let's keep installing we're going for big Power people 180 kilowatts oh and there's also our gfb fuel pressure regulator I think you're meant to open this I think I'm pretty sure it says open on a table so don't drop stuff out of it not like this um there it is [Music] so the fuel rail is in the fuel pressure regulator and gauges in I'm about to do the uh fuel filter the old one the stuff coming out of it this looks like mud just like the stock and this smells like old shellacy like fence paint smells gross so that's you know bad thing about having them sitting around while you're getting ready to fix them up but the good thing is we can drain the fuel tank and basically every bit of the fuel system is now new including all the way up to the injectors and this is a really nice top feed conversion really common now because these injectors are like a more modern and available system than using side feeds we were going to slap new side feeds in it but then couldn't get them in time and or whatever so top feed rally the only difference is you've got to sort of customize your own bits but if you're putting in aftermarket people officially regulate it in any way it's not that big a deal fuel goes in one side comes out the other through the rig back to the tank job done and a gauge on the front which is super easy to set your pressure we're starting it today people car's going to start so starting now the Mad thing is these little adapters so these guys go on the injectors because the injectors are I don't know Bosch or something and then our our connectors are standard Nissan so that also saves you having to cut everything up and resolder everything uh the wiring doesn't quite fit in its Factory location so I've just sort of star distribute back and we'll tuck it in and make it look neat when it comes to boost we need to add a valve in line with the hose supplying pressure to the turbo wastegate diaphragm the function of the wastegate is to regulate how much exhaust gas passes through the turbine and how much pressure is vented out by lowering the pressure to the diaphragm more boost is required to open the wastegate valve which results in higher levels of boost we'll achieve this by installing an aftermarket boost control solenoid its function is to allow the pressure supplied to the wastegate diaphragm to be controlled by the ECU in our case a haltech elite 1500 so most of the work under the Bonnet or the hood if you're a friend from the usar has been done next up we need to make the thing all work haltech um run an adapter which is this this is Plug and Play so basically we've got a haltech elite 1500 and this here will plug directly into the factory Loom which is freaking awesome and then we can get the car on the dyno so that Scotty can dial up our magical 180 kilowatts it is gonna it's probably gonna make a little bit more than that I don't want any I don't want one kilowatt more 240 um it's 240Z isn't it no it's a 240s what is it in what are these in America they call them a 240s SX 240SX is that what they call it yeah what a dumb name it's weird because it's got a 2.4 liter in it does it anyway uh the reason that this is kind of cool is this is like an adapter plug so the factory wiring loom goes click straight into there and then out of here we go from these plugs and then that plugs directly into the back of our haltech like that super simple and what we've tried to do is use a much existing factory wiring as we can unlike some of the old crud we've worked on lately Mazda RX7 where the wiring was completely Cactus this stuff's pretty good so we can use like the factory boost controller wire and that will incorporate this yeah so we have to run any wires for the firewall even the new cores we put in through the firewall I'm going to install it fantastic right now [Music] thank you all right there is the factory ECU in the bin being replaced with this I do have some sad news though we're not going to be able to get it started today we're actually missing some stuff from the intake yeah so I'm gonna go pick it up like now and we'll start it tomorrow we're gonna start it don't worry we'll start it tomorrow it's gonna be so good man [Music] Celtic make a patch harness that makes this ECU a direct plug-in and it's all pre-configured for our car making this super easy the 180 SX list is getting shorter we did a whole big day of it haltech I just did that boost controller yep your sway bars are in what does p plus mean I don't know what the p means okay cause and worrying I've done awesome um oils we've done diff box not engine we've done brake lines which I think I saw somewhere here all brakes off lead brakes brake lines yep done yeah that's done it's good man let's get in there I mean that that's an easy one just throw some tires on that's got to go back on anyway that happens at the same time engine oil is easy and then these two are like big and that's once we get back from paint we are just about ready to start and run this thing but first we're going to make sure it's got all the necessary fluids like some Castrol Edge oil and some coolant the best way for an aftermarket ECU like our haltech Elite to get feedback is to install a wideband oxygen sensor sometimes they can be fitted in the same location as the factory narrowband one but in this case we're going to weld on a threaded bun that the sensor can screw into and then connect it all into the wideband controller and then into the ECU itself finally while priming the fuel pump we're going to set our adjustable fuel pressure regulator to around 40 PSI load up our tuning software and give it a gut full of crushed up dinosaurs all right after all this time it's finally at the stage where we've got to turn the key Dave the absolute Legend is here to help us he was just telling us about how he got stung by jellyfish that sounds [\u00a0__\u00a0] sounds so not fun sounds so [\u00a0__\u00a0] this will be so much less painful well it's a Nissan so you never know it'll probably be just as painful and just as smelly all our mods are in place uh the intake pipe is done we recycled an old bit from an old Subaru on that the wideband sensor is in as well we also made one little change where we ran the map sensor we're going to have a big two meter long pipe that goes to the ECU but actually it's just neater to put a map sensor here and then run two meters of wiring because apparently electricity moves faster than air I don't know that's true it sounds like it is it sounds smart I'm going to say it is so we haven't started it yet we've primed it it's got fuel we drained all the gold crappy fuel that we put new fuel in and now it's the moment of truth don't know if it's going to work no idea I'm turning the key everybody here we go [Applause] now that's a big no from Dave so one of the things that complicates a nice simple easy starting procedure is this car has this I I understand why it's in there it's got this kind of hidden kill switch but it's this kind of momentary button that's hidden under there so you never really know where because the I can turn it like this and all the Reds and stuff come on like it looks like it's primed but there's no fuel pump priming until if you listen now and the fuel pump relay clicks but the pump doesn't go so it's like after the relay which is also not great I'm gonna hold that there it goes there it goes because I'm holding the stupid button which means it doesn't Prime which means it's going to take longer to start anyway we'll work that out here we go try again oh who wants to go it's gonna go is it gonna go it's gonna go no oh dude it's gonna go so close that needs a bracket badly it's another Prime is it people if it doesn't start now I'm giving everybody a discount on the shop and if it does start they're not getting anything does that make sense no not really just do it anyway oh I like the sound of that the discount is 180sx and you'll get 10 off Super Garage t-shirts what I already said that you need something else it's 180 nugget is the discount sure cranking backwards on itself sounds really bad not in a sex move way so what has happened is this is an aftermarket Loom to run our Audi R8 Lamborghini coils golf polo Jedi coils anyway and um it's it plugs in but there was question marks as to whether it's the exact right one for our particular version of Sr s13 SR20 blacktop blah blah so there's a possibility it's just not exactly in the right configuration luckily this is easy to fix because they just need power on Earth which they've got all of them and then there's just four different signal wires the easiest way to fix it is just to re-pin it down at the actual haltech plug just go if this one is supposed to be still under one it's two you just swap them over beep it out make sure it's right plug it back in and crank it again hey Martin are you trying to tell me that the configuration of an Audi R8 Supercar is different to this one adsx I'm trying to say this 180sx is better yeah Dave knows next he knows all right that is cylinder four okay it was very backwards people with Dave's help we're going to re-pin some of these plugs and then we can attempt to start the car again hopefully with everything wired up exactly as it should be it wants to go it's about to go your kill switch I think is doing stupid stupid [\u00a0__\u00a0] again because it did run out of fuel now it's on again thank you very much the car starts after years of sitting in storage and running like absolute ass when it did work and I am so excited that it finally has pure Nissan power running through its veins again and I have pure Nissan power running through my veins again too it has been a big Journey getting it to this place but the journey is not over we're not even near the tip no of the mountain no oh we might not not only the tip of the tunnel uh it's screaming making weird noises it's leaking oil it's leaking other stuff I don't even know what else it's leaking down there but there's there's colors of liquid that I don't even remember putting in the car um so there's a couple little things to do there's empty power steering reservoir for some reason there's an oil leakage I'm pretty sure the turbo return because it looked a bit dodgy but we'll get under there and have a look but oh yeah it starts which is awesome so it can move to its next stage yeah what is that stage oh you're about to say about people you are about to be flipping over backwards naked like a squirrel with nuts in the middle of hibernation and your spare rooms full of food you invite all your friends over next thing you know I can't imagine it's gonna be what it's like to be inside your brain s13 Nissan SR20 sounds like poo is awesome you actually appear to be loving it even more than me if such a thing is possible I love this oh this is my favorite thing to do to cars like make this all new and modern and nice and work and like all right calls dude you've got an Audi now basically I've already got one oh yeah true if you are next big step for this build which we are just ridiculously frothing for is paint I'll make Trung from Powder house agreed to make this thing look as good as the day it rolled off the production line maybe even better because we're using some properly mad quality materials to make this thing look epic step one is to spray a guide coat and then strip off the stuff we aren't keeping then block the car back to try and find any damage that might be hiding under its 30 year old paintwork turns out there are a few bits that need a new section of metal welded in mostly on the boot and we're doing the second lot of indicator holes while we're at it I mean in large amounts my daughter gotta eat too overall the panels are pretty straight and only a few spot repairs are required before the car can be put into primer we're also doing a new rear bumper bar which unlike the rest of the car is fiberglass so making this thing fit is challenging with the new parts fitted and the repairs done it's time to roll the car into the booth and hit it with some primer I've moved so fast in the flash you'll see everybody getting left behind after the prime is completely dry trunk can block the car back and make sure it's straight ready to get its first base coat [Music] speed it up [Music] and then after warming up the paint the base coat can be sprayed on the color is an exact match to the original Factory wide it just looks way newer because it hasn't sat in the sun fading for 30 years although we've shown this transformation in less than five minutes there is hundreds of hours of Labor in a respray like this not to mention the skills you need to get good at it in the first place so if you find a good painter make sure you shout them their fair share of kebabs for turning your old nugget into gold [Music] it looks amazing Trung has done such a good job he did finally the car has had some of the love that it deserved I decided to go the top deck which means we are black up the top white everywhere else because the car had a sunroof and that's black anyway it just looked nice blacking that off I seem to do that with a lot of my cars black mirror caps Martin what do you think it's so glossy he's done an amazing job on this car um the amount of effort that he puts in is unreal and this is not intended to be show car finish it you know didn't take six months to a year or longer which a lot of repaints do he just smashed it out in a matter of weeks which is which is absolutely awesome and it is glass it's just so good he's done all the effort to do the prep to put the bass down to clear it to do all that stuff and then also to buff it back so it's just like it's it looks amazing really in the flesh um I'm just so impressed that yeah black turret which is really good a few little details that we're going to sort of fix up and it's actually guys it's black too you can see some white residue but that's actually the Polish so um it's a bit deceiving but yeah it needs things like wiper Blazers inside it needs the panel stuck back on the paint is still gassing off and still drying that's why it's still in pieces but we're going to unpack the big box that he sent us with all the other painted stuff in it so we can work out what needs to happen next so one of the things that I really wanted to do with this 180 and with my previous 180s was to give it a Type X conversion so we've got the Type X Wing we've got the rear lights which cost millions of dollars and a Type X front bar as well we've got the side skirts those are in here I've got some seats I've got some Wheels I got some tires some interior bits uh some kind of high touch things like the knob that's on the gear shifter and stuff like that a new Nismo one of them which is fancy and then the Pista resistance I have an old logo Nismo oil cap worth thousands of dollars that's going to go on that's going to go on last and that's when we know the project is done so let's dive into this box and you and I will see at the same time exactly what we've got oh this is so exciting there's the Timex Wings awesome look at it oh look at it mad look at that it's so good I know that we're not assembling right now but I just do want to we need to see it sit this like that it's going to look like that mountain it's going to be so good yeah that looks red oh amazing all right let's keep keep unpacking this amazing package of Awesomeness so when you paint a card what you'll notice is um a lot of the time everything's sort of usually covered in a fine layer of dust because all paint shops all panel shops end up Dusty because so much sanding's going on so even so some of these panels might look a bit grubby looks a good example like over here because this is two pack paint that has been cured that is like totally fine and good to go everything will just need a bit of a clean up when we put it on the car most important is we don't scratch it so I say that while holding a knife right near it but that's that one side skirt there that is a side skirt that is a OEM Nissan plastic side skirt so that's not an eBay fiberglass situation that is um that's a proper aftermarket Nissan we will fit everything we'll get all the right adhesives and stuff to fit it all properly because there's different glues and stuff that you need for different areas of the car depending what you're doing whether it's a side skirt or a towel liner and then we'll start to fit this stuff up and then once it's all fitted up we give the car a proper detail get all the dust and dirt and all the stuff on it make sure everything's attached properly and then the car will be looking freaking amazing this is my uh Type X front bar that I imported from the states just don't want to lose track of this oh look at that look at that I am so pumped for this oh it's coming out people [Applause] can you just lift the whole thing up and then I'm just gonna debug it oh look at it hasn't been crashed into anything it's just new and not yet hey hey all right I've got it I've got it oh yeah man nice oh look at that everybody just so new so white I'm not actually going to put it on but just have a look at this for a second just have a look at the kind of situation that's going to be happening over here people just start to just yes so good freshly painted so good it is so good I'm sorry if I'm acting weird it's just because I'm excited and there's just the original uh rear bar and then the um bit under the Bonnet you also the on the Bonnet has this um cool luck liner stuff as well keep noise down and whatever and then you put the black thing back under there we've also got um the brackets for arrive so in the time while the cars are paying a few parts that got held up have arrived including what was that mutton nothing nothing fell on the ground don't worry about it Trump gave us touch-up paint because I always end up scratching cars um we've also got from 5.0 ignite which is our bracket to run our VW Audi Lamborghini Polo coils and some adapters for that too and also a triggering system and a photo which looks like it's from ages ago this is from Purity box man Purity box no that one's actually going in the bin okay good um this is from the 2010 Perth Auto Salon uh 25th of July 2010. um from Kev #does it fit my Honda what a legend well so we met in 12 years ago me and him yeah 12 years ago wow now he runs this which is pretty cool so we've got our can you please hold that got our bracketry which is awesome and we've also got I think this is a trigger kit yeah so this trigger kit takes the old school crank angle or can angle sensor out of the equation with um with that which is pretty epic so that's just the bolting nice Bolton thing and that will work with the haltech as well and Trigger everything without any issues it's time to get the car up in the air so we can start putting it all back together this is the part of the project where I cross my fingers and hope that all the parts I bought in advance are correct because it took so long to ship everything to Australia I'm starting on the rear end cookie conversion also known as a Type X conversion which includes rear lights and the center garnish this drastically updates the look of the car and brings it in line with exactly what I'm going for so this here is the coveted Center garnish that makes the Type X conversion work with a shape of these new lights one thing that I forgot to do though is get the Type X lock you can see how much fatter this is and now there's a big gap between here and this lock mechanism here so to get one of these uh that suits a Type X from Japan is probably a two month weight I have managed to find one on eBay that doesn't have a key but it is the right length so at least it's going to look right so I'm going to keep assembling this for now that should arrive in the next day or so and then I can change that lock component out and then maybe I can make the key work with it maybe I'll get another one later but for now it just means that we can keep assembling without it looking too bad because with that big hole it's not great it's time to get the Type X conversion done so we can move on with the build all that's left to do is some minor wiring changes but I am so stoked with how good this looks next up the festi 30 year old floor mats can go in the bin because they literally smell like bong smoke and sweat I'm attempting to straighten out the lower sill as 30 years of driving on and off hoists and being jacked up at drift meets has bent them out of shape the factory side skirts bolt to the seals and are screwed in from both the top and at either end next I'm going to grind off all the old crusty adhesive and use some nice fresh double-sided tape to make sure they stick flush with the rest of the body these skirts were hard to find they weren't cheap and due to their age are a little bit brittle so some drift stitching will be required to prevent them from falling apart any further [Music] so the side skirts are on now they are an OEM parts so they fit really nice they are also secondhand so I had to spend a bit of time grinding off old glue and putting new fasters and stuff in but overall I'm really happy with how they turned out now we've got to move on to the front the rear end looks amazing By the Way That Type X conversion just always looks so good on 180s it's amazing again the fitment is not like perfect like you'd expect from a brand new car when people are kind of 3D scanning and CNC you know making parts for things but it does fit it does work the front bar is now going to be the true test there are a bunch of different brackets and little JDM things that say Nissan on them that are meant to attach somewhere and we haven't worked that out yet Factory though right Factory yeah Nissan parts I assuming it'll be better but there might be some things in the way I've also got a front mount of course which yeah I can now come off which is cool ready to reveal in all of its Glory it is also leaking something we haven't worked out what I think it's power steering fluid but we've got to fix that we're just going to sort of get all the panels back on so they're safe and um yeah should be a winner look how good it looks though people look at that thread it's almost like it calls for a little really nice spread of intonation on that one isn't it beautiful it's got quite a wide range compared to some yeah it's very brilliant sounding all right cool cool let's just do a quick little test fit of this front bar and see if it's going to work or whether our day is not going to be that good thank you [Music] you know how earlier on I was saying that um I didn't have the correct cylinder lock for the back because the Type X bar actually sits a little bit further out I ordered one online and this box here that says cylinder lock on it I'm pretty sure is going to be yes that's exactly what I need all right I'm going to take that back off and install this foreign [Music] foreign [Music] so when I ordered this conversion kit to convert this one into a Type X I did manage to get most of the right parts I need so these brackets here the front bumper support but what I didn't get was the type X pods that go here so these are the ones that came on the car and you can see these would normally sit like this and connect to the bumper the Type X ones are different because you can see that it's kind of fat it kind of comes out here so getting those is a um there are a couple of options but I want to keep that OEM I have managed to find some so I've managed to find a left and a right they are going to need to be painted but they are genuine and they're brand new Nissan items so they are coming the other thing that I forgot to get is the emblem for the front bumper if you have a look over here that is completely uh bald at the moment but I've managed to get a Type X emblem so that is coming as well so that stuff is still going to be how long I don't know they're crazy times at the moment but we don't need to be able to move the car around I found some Wheels on the internet that do fit I'm not sure what's going to stay on there long term but we can get the car rolling around and then once we've got a few other little things fixed then we can move into the interior but for now we're waiting on parts and we're going to put some wheels on foreign [Music] the Volkswagen Audi Lambo calls I've used to fit the spark plug tube just fine but a bracket is a good idea to stop them moving around to Mad CNC item with locking collars and bolts into the factory rocker cover which I now need to remove to do a cam angle sensor upgrade the factory cam angle sensor connects via a cog system onto the exhaust camshaft to detect how fast it's spinning in relation to the crank this allows Nissan to do four sequential Fuel and Spark with the ECU that saves a little Fuel and also feels nice and smooth and modern to drive it's a common mod for reliability on Nissans to upgrade this to a non-contact sensor and that is achieved by installing a tone wheel in place of the factory Cog and installing a new sensor into the side of the head one major part of this mod is that you're replacing a 30 year old part exposed to Decades of heat Cycles in a hot part of the engine with a brand new part this will only work with aftermarket ecus and the benefit is a more accurate trigger signal which can help with tuning [Music] with our new trigger system in place we can clean up the mating surface of the rocker cover and stick it back onto the engine and then everything can be left to dry [Music] I just found another dollar this Rick car that keeps giving time to put the seats in the bin because they've been injected with rectal slime for almost three decades with the seats out this is the perfect opportunity to give the inside of the car and the carpet a good clean and see what other Treasures may be hidden down below I will need some of the seat belt components from the factory seats such as the seat belt clips luckily no tools are required they were so loose I can remove them by hand Safety First kids now we can also get our ECU checked and fired up and Dave from haltech is here to make sure that everything is working exactly as it should [Music] electrical stuff is now done we've got our air temp sensor plugged in today's been tapping away at the keyboard changing our triggering type now we find out if our new sensor that we're putting is actually going to work see if the car will start foreign [Music] [Music] system appears to be working the timing light looks good now it's time to hear this thing yep get Keen that's right all right people here we go forgot your kill switch excellent so excellent I hope the check engine light is meant to be on I checked there's an engine the car is running it's sounding good that is excellent it works enough to be able to get it to the dyno next up it's time to do some of the extra pieces including the interior so this here we got a couple of seats these are a Caro sr3s which I believe came Factory in some Civics like EK Civics and dc2 type R Integris or something we got these for forty thousand dollars and they look like that they are in really good condition and um that there is the uh I think that one there is the driver's side seat and then over here in this box we've got some rails so seats are going in I've just been giving the interior a little bit of a clean up under the seats I was considering changing the carpet it actually doesn't need changing it's in really good condition it's nice and black which is what I'd want to change it to if it was that kind of festy 80s gray but it's not so uh seats gone rails gone then I got a steering wheel gear knob some other little interior bits then I've also had arrive the pods that we were missing last time these which go on the front bar like this so these were the pieces were missing last time so they go on there Trung has painted those as well and then the other thing that I have is the uh risers razors for the Type X bar for that to go on so we we are getting close we are getting close there's just lots of little bits and pieces um but we're just going to dive in get the seats in get the steering wheel done and then we'll move on to the exterior stuff as well as all of the mechanical updates that we've done so far the interior of the car is also getting a freshen up start with replacing the factory steering wheel with something brand new we've got a whole video with step-by-step instructions on how to change a steering wheel which you can check out on our Channel there are heaps of options and it's made easier with this car because there's no airbags to make the new wheel fit an adapter kit is required and then your aftermarket steering wheel will Mount to this [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] with the new steering wheel installed now I can move on to the seats using seats in a car that were not designed for it usually requires the use of adapter rails these convert the factory seat mounting positions on the car to the mounts on the seats well they're meant to but they don't always fit and you may need a pry bar hammer drill or even a welder depending on what your setup requires to make these fit bolt-on doesn't always mean bolt-on there are loads of cheap and fake seats available but for a build like this it was really important for me to have genuine seats that are quality recurras like this are expensive even second hand but they are totally worth it because they're some of the best seats available and I'm stoked to have such awesome quality in my 180. seats are in and they look freaking amazing and the car is starting to look just like the poster which was drawn before the car was even built these posters are only available while this build series is on if you don't have one yet grab it now and we'll autograph it and send it to your door anywhere in the world next up it's time to install the Type X bumper pods which I managed to get as genuine items that were already here locally in Australia I'm also changing out this slime-covered Nismo knob for a brand new one that is exactly the same design because I really like it [Music] foreign steering wheel and gear knob are done and the test sit is a massive success now it's time to install the pistol resistance the Type X Wing dude this is the cherry on the cake it is the sweet the Cherry Pie top I put it over the holes you put it over your holes yep hold on no I'll put it just let go for a sec no let go is yours lined up no mine's that's lined up on my side line yours up on the holes I'll just let go of it give it now that's that's right that looks good on this side we are back in super garage now because the length of the exhaust is not correct with our vertex bar you can see just the from the short amount of time we've been starting it that there is turning all black but not in a good way speaking of good things you asked for it we finally have it chopped hoodies it's got chopped fingers on the front it's got chopped fingers on the back they are available right now so you can pick them up on the shop what are we doing we're chopping off the exhaust we're modifying it we're going to weld some new bits on this twin pipe I do kind of like the OEM plusness of that too it just doesn't fit now look we could try and cut it and trim it in something else I don't know if that would work but we bought a couple of components I got a Canon it's what I used to have so I just I want to put that on there because I think it's going to be cool and then maybe I can swap back to something like that later this is not a specific 180sx exhaust this has been built which is good and bad sides of some mild steel bits in there that are kind of a little bit Rusty but it doesn't matter it'll last just nice nicely and fine uh this is just a aftermarket Muffler that someone's made fit it fit the old car really well this one is specifically 40180 but but we're probably going to have to move the mounts yeah so these are going to have to move back it's got some silencer in there that's going to go in the bin and so then um we also do have this Muffler though so that's a good thing so we're going to try and keep that muffler so that because if you just go turbo on this it'll be so loud you wake the dead if we keep another Muffler in there it should actually be pretty good and it's got a cat as well that's where that is set to mount we actually need it more like that because the black up the bumper doesn't look cool does it not cool so this here is about to get chopped a chopped a check it out on the mighty come on Shop link below reciproc saw that chop that off zot it on cut these off we're going to cut and weld some stuff like the world's worst power steering leak so we're getting a hose made to fix that yeah it's just dropping stuff everywhere you know at least if we know that now because it's running all right let's chop [Music] we're going to be adapting a new exhaust parts to fit our existing system which in my experience is actually way harder than making a whole new one from scratch obviously a bolt-on system is the ultimate in ease of install assuming it actually does bolt on welding old middle to new metal and getting all the angles right takes a bit of trial and errant but I reckon I can make this work with the help of the Hoist and some stands we'll send the old Muffler to the big metal Shredder where it can be turned into a can of beans and then we'll cut the mounts off the new Cannon this will allow us to place the muffler exactly where it needs to be in the bumper cutout and then work back towards the existing exhaust system [Music] a whole lot of eyeballing ensures that the muffler looks good in its final position we're roughing in the angle of the cannon and the position left to right then tackling the hangers back onto the muffler next I'm going to cut up a bunch of three inch bins to join the cannon to the rest of the exhaust some careful measuring and tacking is the key to getting this ride but sometimes you do get it wrong and a quick hit with an angle grinder can break the tax and you can try again once it all looks right I'm going to run a few welds on each join so it doesn't move when I take it off and weld the whole thing together I'll be using a MIG because it's fast and the whole thing is going to be painted [Music] foreign [Music] the exhaust is done and it is a fruit salad of a pipe if you have a look down here there is basically every food group here of all colors sizes distinctions and smells starting from the butthole of the turbo exactly right and then we do our catalytic converter which is cool got our dump pipe and our Flex joint uh why didn't we just get a new one um well yeah you can't and if you can they're made like quite cheap really thin material the Mufflers don't muffle they actually I think they just end up making the car sound like [\u00a0__\u00a0] and I thought this car sounded pretty good with the muffler that was on it I mean if you're gonna go a full system you just get JDM legit is what I wanted to do you just like you get the whole thing that was not possible in the time frame that we had this here is functional it's a three inch turbo back system and it appears to be custom made for this car there are so many pieces I'm kind of good with that having custom made some exhausts and known how difficult it is but knowing that they just fit really well like this just it fits great and yes okay is a bit of surface rust on it but there's no holes in it it's not leaking anything one two three four five six seven different eight different nine different 10 yep 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 piece exhaust You could argue that the amount of welding required to stitch This Together probably would have cost more in gas than a whole exhaust but happy with it it's going to work it's going to sound good it's going to muffle enough so it's not going to offend everyone and it's going to be good all right so um we've just got a little repair to do at the front for the power steering and then Martin we're off to the dyno to make our 100 280 kilowatts once the car's working we also have to get it made legal for Street use because it's been unregistered for so long this involves an authorized inspection to make sure that it's safe it meets design and safety standards and a check for tires body condition working lights indicators horn and dash engine leaks seat belts and a brake efficiency test only then can we get number plates insurance and registration because I've updated the rear lights they no longer work with the factory Loom plugs so I need to resolder old style plugs onto the new lights it's fairly simple because even though the updated lights are a new design most of the wire colors have stayed the same so it's just a matter of mixing and matching and with that done the lights and indicators are now all working it's time for the awesome dirty Nissan 180 to go on the dyno and see if all those mods that we've done particularly to the engine the fuel system the ignition system have been worth it especially with our mad new S15 turbo cram and some boost into it it is a very very exciting day now we originally wanted to go to the dino last but this one we had it booked in there's a bunch of stuff that hasn't been done it doesn't have the badge on it yet it doesn't have my old Nismo old logo cap on the oil yes because that is that's when we know that it's all done uh we've still got to fix up the wing stuff you probably saw last episode that didn't fit properly that is something we're gonna have to do later but today it's about getting it on the dyno and seeing what kind of power we make now Martin at wastegate pressure it's possible that we actually make more than the 180 and that means this project has been a complete not a failure no we'll not a father at all it look it's com it is completely possible that that happens but also I would say this car hasn't been driven for ages it's sat around for a long time and when we did drive it when we first got it on the track it was very very unhappy so being that's not registered yet we haven't been able to put any case on it this is the first time we're really going to be uh driving in any anger on the dyno so I'm crossing my fingers nothing explodes out of it rods oils fluids coolant anything that's supposed to be inside the car driven in love Martin yes so that's what the dinosaur we're gonna test it as long as everything works we're tuning this thing and then we'll be ready to Rego and drive well we didn't set up from the very beginning that we wanted 180 kilowatts at the wheel you did say if we don't get 180 kilowatts at the wheels the mission has not been accomplished it means you've failed but if it makes 240 kilowatts at the wheels I'll be cheering and I will have one as you know we'll be winning in every way in carness um all right Scotty of course is going to be helping us the tuning fog he's been helping us for years he knows about his cars we of course will be taking a guess of what kind of power it can make and the winner will be getting a prize uh in fact right now is your opportunity before we go any further to guess below what the number is don't fast forward just look right now below put your guess in of how much power you think it's going to make and um let's see actually you'll get a prize too you know what someone we're going to give you a prize too let's load it on the dyno let's spin it up let's see how we go while we are aiming for the specific figure of 180 kilowatts it doesn't mean that the car will actually make it in fact it could make more or less that is just the physics of the system and the name of the game and that's assuming the car works at all other than driving on and off a tow truck it's still completely untested and a full send on the dyno could be the exact thing that makes this car go kablamo I am down here with turning fork also known as Scotty helzinger thank you very much hello mate before we start I know people come down here all the time and they go they've got a magic number I want 500 kilowatts I want a thousand kilowatts I so I am coming to you with that today all right these it always makes me nervous okay I want and I don't want any more and we do it all right you know it's amazing this is the probably the first request ever I think with this we can make the lower number of 180. can we yeah I think so okay what I'm nervous about is if we can't get enough boost out of it and we make more than that so this is an unusual we can't make more so it just needs to be one all right the world is full of YouTube builds and everyone making a million kilowatts these what are these stock 100 105 yeah they're not much approximately yes 180 makes a really fun car would you not agree can you help me hold down the veil of the too much power on the internet steam if this makes 180 kilowatts the thing is going to run forever you can take it to any track day you can hold it flat and then you can use your driving skill and your car set up to actually enjoy that rather than just make 400 kilowatts and then first Corner you're done Scotty Hill's here everybody Scotty helzinger we also have over here uh Martin of course is still here and David's here as well he's recovered from his jellyfish sex incident uh and he's he's back so we're here on the dyno 180 kilowatts um we've gone through all the mods the car's here it's freshly painted please don't lean on it uh I mean where you were holding it was fine yep that's okay now it's not finished yet so don't be checking too closely the panel gaps and there's no badge over there and there's no wing and a few holes don't worry about any of that we're getting to that but we're here for you because all this films we're here for me come on we're here for me my car but I'm very happy to be working with you again today always a pleasure what we'll do before we get too carried away let's just do a bit of a health check so we'll warm the thing up and then check oils just check everything and make sure that we're not missing anything then we'll do some revving stuff and make sure that all the belts are going to stay together and we don't have any funny noises yeah then we'll get into the tuning part of it no point in doing a tuning part until we make sure the thing is going to hold together great all right let's do it thanks for having us down pleasure with a car like this that is untested we're starting our session by running it up at low RPM to give everything a check and sure enough we already have a problem we're not getting boost control well a couple of little gremlins but nothing crazy so the first one was just some boost control Plumbing which that happens all the time even I forget which input which one's the in and which ones the out on the solenoids I always just look it up um the other thing that we've got there is there's two two pin plugs in the 180sx one of them's a an Evap solenoid and the other one is the boost control solenoid so we've just got those two back to front I like how you very politely said we have these Gremlins it was me that installed this I think it's so it's hard to say we at all I got it wrong [Laughter] in other news we is tuning up really nice the injector setup is all really good okay good the fuel pressure seems to be set well it's at 43 and a half pounds which is about pretty much normal what you'll be expecting but the injector size and everything is all working really well okay good I can sort of tell that because the way that we tune the engine is how efficient it is so basically every time the camshaft spins around it's a two liter engine two liters of air should go in and two liters of air should come out it uh except for when it's boosted but we kind of let's just talk about it as if it's an aspirated thing so the efficiency of the engine at 100 efficiency two liters in two liters out yeah knowing how much air is there I can then set my air to fuel ratio I just need to then map out how efficient the engine is which being a four-stroke engine it's roughly 50 efficient at idle and roughly 100 efficient flat out yeah which is normally 90 95 something like that okay um when all my numbers in my fuel map all kind of line up it tells me that I'm not manipulating anything or trying to make up for inefficiencies in fuel system or injector size or anything like that yeah and at the moment everything's looking really really good the O2 trims are all working well so not much to report as soon as we can get this thing ticking and get some more boost in it yeah things are good a quick general question if we're running a Turbocharger with one bar of Boost so one atmospheric pressure 14.7 are we now putting in four liters of air and four leaders out like is is it double because we're literally adding we have the normal we have the normal aspiration and then we have the same amount again yep we're expecting to double yep double the oxygen content that's in there yeah and because if we're putting 15 pounds of boost into it we would also expect to put a hundred percent more fuel into it would be the rule of thumb yeah okay um there are inefficiencies so you don't always exactly double the power is that to do with heat as well um it's heat it's inefficiencies in flow it's the exhaust restriction and it's the exhaust turbine restriction as well so the the back pressure from atmosphere on the exhaust system makes a difference and okay the more stuff you're pushing out the harder it is so there is a diminishing return there you can't put two bar or 30 pounds of boost in it and get three times the aspirated power I could hear you talk all day Scotty are you the same do you feel like you could just listen to this all day I could I love it and I get to do it in person I feel very lucky I feel very lucky Scotty I do enjoy it I still really really like it it's nice it's good to be able to do all this stuff you've been doing it for a long time I thought we'd been doing it for a long time we've been doing the show for 15 years you've been doing this for 20 right nearly nearly 20 years yeah long time thanks every single day I think I still learn something which is probably the um the attraction to it you know it's really nice luckily this is a fairly simple fix swap two of the lines around and then reap in a plug and we're ready to try again Dave's just rewired it our new Deutsch connector with his fancy look how fancy this is look at that so special anyway Aunt now we are um testing it and um Scotty can activate it from inside the car and now we're hearing relays going click click so we're not talking which is awesome now that we've got some boost control we're gonna spin it up again on the dyno with a target of 12 pounds of boost initially and see what kind of power figures we can achieve all Full Throttle go [Music] [Music] ribs just touched the rebel a bit at the very top there all right so 149 kilowatts on 12 pounds Turn the Page up so we'll put two degrees of timing in it we're so far away from and it's a drama but what we'll see here is if we're even closer we get a significant gain as soon as we don't get a significant game we'll pull out of it straight away okay cool [Music] [Applause] a little enough so we're going to move it up to 14.7 one bar and that should get us closer if not achieving our 180 kilowatts at the wheels let's do it Scotty Beam us up Pages up Scotty Target fresh eyes now 15 pounds 15. I'll start our data logging come up on it Full Throttle let's do it 181 81 80. that's going to be close it'll go under it'll go under okay so I picked up a lot of mid-range because the Boost is coming on earlier now yes um top end yeah not a lot of heat so what do we do now up we go 17 18. 18. three at a time yeah confidence yeah I've got confidence in you not in myself in you oh no all right here we go 18 PSI for 180 kilowatts in the 180sx let's do it Scotty I feel good about this one people feeling good [Music] look at that curve look at the curve let's check the numbers yeah is that it are we done no no we need it we need to see one eight so do we go 18.5 now or we just go to 19 or do we just go to 20. Let's tidy up the ignition timing that'll do it why not let's have a look let's put in we'll put two degrees in up here and just see what happens see what it wants okay all right here we go on Full Throttle go oh wasn't too much it wasn't too much never too much is it I'm going to do that 183. yeah hey good job excellent thank you man thank you Scotty good job admittedly a relatively straightforward job but the one thing I do just I just want to point out with it that turbocharger on it have a look at this thing it is making over 150 kilowatts for the meat of the Rev range yes yeah and that is the thing that if we go and put a gt35 on this or a gt30 it's going to do this right yeah and the difference will be that down low you don't have that drivability yeah for that amount of time yeah so yeah I get it that it's mad at three and four and 500 kilowatts and I definitely appreciate that but I also appreciate targeting something like this is this the lowest powered performance modified car you've had on here other than a Honda very very very long time your aspirated Honda is 140 150 kilowatts so um so I get it if you might get slightly frustrated that it's it's only making 180 no no because we're back in 1994 now yeah 95 96 people didn't want to blow their warranty straight away like this is 19 96 1997 era power imagine owning a 180 SX with warranty like VM yes the shape of this car back then would have been like it's pretty radical yeah yeah yeah this is lining up with what I remember because yeah 22 pounds T28 yeah at 10 kilowatts per pound yeah okay on a stock S15 turbo 220 on on low 20 pounds of boost was the number yeah because they are not even though they're famous engines they are not these massive powerhouses are they the combo on it is perfect the thing hasn't missed a beat so we've got nice at idles yeah it's idling it makes mad Choo-Choo noises 900 RPM it's got good vacuum turn it off Scotty just turns off no no just we're done that's it yeah we're done we're finished I thought you were worried it was it was one running out of life just idling I'm so happy with that curve thank you very much always a pleasure you are the boss tuning fork yep you're the big boss oh thanks guys I I always enjoy your day on the dyno you know that it was a lot of fun too Martin I'm stoked yeah should be that's mad that's gonna be so good to drive you can tell from that code that's straight away put your foot down it's going to boost up it's going to make mad sounds you're gonna be gone yeah sideways hopefully we've hit the power figure and nothing's exploded and I am absolutely stoked now we've just got to finish a bunch of little jobs in preparation for our street registration 100 looking amazing uh we've just come back from the dyno and mighty and I've done a bunch of little like fiddly things fix UPS um the most probably important thing is I change the coolant overflow bottle these do have a reputation for cracking and ours were starting to have hairline cracks all through it if that lets go you get corn everywhere it's not a fun time you can buy aftermarket ones which is awesome like remade one so I just replaced that which was super easy and my next job was also to tuck away all the ECU stuff so rather than having it hanging around in the footwell and you end up stepping on it or getting crap on it or just uh tucked it all on in and put the factory panel back in place now at the back of the car I had to do the number plate adapter it's got one of those weird like JDM Flappy ones and also run the wiring and the lights for the running lights that light up the number plate at night uh put all the interior back together so the kick panels and stuff if you have a look inside now it is just absolutely Bellissimo I would actually say there's probably not many 180s in the country that are this clean so there's a couple of tiny little things that still have to happen the whole car needs a little bit of a kind of a clean and detail inside a couple little things fixed up it's not registered yet as we spoke about it still needs the blue slip so it has to go through all of the safety stuck check check all the lights and everything that we expect to be happening in the next one to two days uh the wing we have to repair the back and repaint all of that stuff that is going to happen and then it's ready to actually reveal it in its finished form and go for a drive and drive it yeah yeah it drives really nice the power steering also kind of fixed itself the big drama we had literally the day that we're going to the dyno was the high pressure feed for the power steering just gave up just leaking we fixed it we put new fittings and then there was like a pinhole Lick in the actual rubber that was spraying stuff everywhere so just having a bad time so end up just replacing it with a dash 6 AM line and some bump tubes that go into the power steering thing but I did it late at night and I wasn't watching and then I had a tiny kink in it so I had no power steering and I thought oh well work that out reposition it put it back together quickly slap it on the truck to take it to the dyno and once I was on the dyno it fixed itself because it just bled out all the air and now it has power steering it works fine so that's good the last 20 always but I think right now being that it's mostly finished it's time it's time for this item Martin badge Engineers it's time for this to go on this is a Type X emblem it's called emblem red because it is and that is going to be going right here I imagine it probably has some like sticky stuff on it if it doesn't we can find it if it doesn't we will put some on there no no we are we're good so here we go oh it's got um we've got to drill some holes I do we yeah cool we've got to drill Oh either that or these are going to be snapped off but I'm pretty sure take them off we're gonna just go oh I do look so good this is pretty exciting isn't it Martin really I mean you've just got a you just gotta love what's been going on over here mate all right there's that one now before I get too excited and do the badge we also have to make sure that the car is covered now all of our cars are insured with Shannon's they're a sponsor of the show and the 180 even though it's not been registered has been with Shannon's as laid up cover which means it's been covered while we've been working on it so it might be off the road you might be restoring It Whatever light up cover means you still have some coverage laid up cover stops when your car moves under its own power so in our situation the car's been dynoed it's roadworthy now and ready to be taken for an inspection I now start you can drive it there to get it inspected so at that point you want to call up and change it back to full comprehensive yeah and so as well as having all of the different insurance for cars Shannon's also do CTP they do home they do roadside and stuff like that but what's important for us is that we get a choice of repair and also agreed value so some insurance you might call and they go oh we think it's worth this whereas with Shannon's There's an actual value and we know that these cars have been going up in value you can't get them for five grand anymore when we were looking you couldn't even get in for twenty thousand dollars so it's a matter of having a chat with them and working out exactly you know agreeing what we think the car's worth and then that will be locked in that is the car's value um and so we need to get that ready we need a CTP which is a compulsory third-party insurance that we have here in New South Wales get the comprehensive done so I'm going to call and get that done so look we'll get the badge on then we'll sort all of that out but if you need a quote for your car or house or bike you can check that out at shannons.com and then we can go get our number plates and drive it on the street which is what this is all for so mad Martin we need to do this together mate all right I'm going to peel the first bit off you peel the next bit off all right Martin are you ready you get your finger on there as well Martin say when when our 180sx's registration has been rejected and the last couple of months all last couple of years of doing this project has all been a big waste of time I mean we got to hang out yeah we had to fix the car but it's you can't you can't drive it what's the point it's not a race car other than the annoyance of not being able to drive the car there is also the financial consideration that an unregisterable 180sx regardless of its condition is probably worth between eight and twelve thousand dollars a registered one like what we've done is probably worth 25 or 30 at least more absolutely roadworthy yeah um so here's the problem we went down to service New South Wales um and um and they said no they said no they just didn't they said no so we've registered a few cards from scratch before I mean a notable one would be the mirror for example um which is something that you know got completely redone um the super turbo imported that had to register that so you've got to do the same thing you get all your approvals get all your paperwork get your compulsory third party insurance which is a thing in New South Wales um in case you hit someone that doesn't cover the uh the car that covers the person it's a way of making sure that there's um like medical care for everyone and paying for all that can I go through this Martin and then we're going to uh we've done it a few times we know what paperwork we need um but we just got rejected I'm gonna this is from the actual website okay this is what I think we should be going off if your vehicle's New South Wales registration has expired but it's within three months of the expiry date you're still able to renew the registration which is not yay that's not us but yay for those people for those people the vehicles will be registered if the registration expired more than three months ago you'll need to re-register it so start from scratch establish registration what do you need an application for registration we did it your proof of identity we did it tick your business or organization details if applicable your compulsory third party insurance and authorize unregistered vehicle inspection report blue slit got it um payment and number plates you will receive number plates when the vehicle's registered yes we did all of that we took all of that and they said no they said no now the reason that they said no and this is the bit that I can't work out is that they want I'm still trying to get my head around this because it's so stupid they want a receipt from the person who owned it before the person we bought it from to us they wanted they want a receipt from the last one I need to do this they want a receipt from the last registered owner which is not who we bought the car from so as you know cars bounce around you know people sometimes choose to let their registration last because if you pay it every year usually you're paying over a thousand bucks a year to keep something registered so if you've got something off the road maybe you choose to let it lapse knowing that you'll have to go through this process later on it's a it's a more thorough inspection they've got to check the engine numbers and the shades of numbers and everything match up but the car because it has been registered in New South Wales before is on record that VIN is on their records when they look it up on their end they see a person who used to own it or who the last person that had the Rego and they want a receipt from that person except we don't know who that person even is Martin I've got a little scientific diagram just here that I'm going through it I love your direction I like your drawing skills now this guy here he owned a 180sx there he is now he sold it for money to this guy actually I have a story about that unregistered uh the reason his face is upside down is because I drew it upside down I thought he was just really sad anyway he sold it to him unregistered so here's a number plate no unregistered which you're allowed to do he sold it to us for money unregistered as an unregistered car my understanding is that the RMS wants a receipt not from him not from the person we bought it from but the last registered owner they want a receipt from him saying that we bought the car from him but if my understanding is correct that would be fraud we didn't buy a car we didn't buy a cup and then so I can't get a receipt from him saying that we gave him money because we never gave him money now why is this a problem that means if you bought a car like a barn find right you bought it and you go oh I'm going to do it up I'm going to whatever and it's been sitting there for 30 or 40 years and then you go the Project's too big for me and you sell it for you mate your mate according to this if this is correct would need a receipt from whoever put it in the barn 40 years ago yes who might not even be around that's right so I just rang this guy who's the guy we got the car from that's us that's him don't know who that is and said hey man they've asked us for a receipt from him and he said that's weird as you'd expect but he also said I traded the car for Hot Wheels what and I went Hot Wheels was that like the toys and he goes yeah so he goes I don't know how to give you a receipt because I swapped it for Hot Wheels also like so right on so he so this is wrong I said he traded this for money but he traded this for Hot Wheels for a Hot Wheels car yeah so then now what we need to do is we need to go to the RMS and go this guy has a receipt for a Hot Wheels car for a real car yes which we then swapped see it goes around and around we then swapped for money yes for here yes now so the person behind the counter has then told us which I've never heard before that I need to go to and see a justice of the peace right a justice of the peace is someone who is designated by the governor to keep the peace and and there it's it's a volunteer position of somebody whose job in life is to um witness affidavits and verified documents verify that you've signed it not verify the document right it doesn't matter what's in it you just he just go did you actually sign it show me your idea and then they check it right well I don't well the reason that that doesn't make sense to me is that they want to know that we own the car but I have a receipt from but not only do I have that it's the requirement on there I need proof of ownership that's the receipt that I have with the car so anyway I have to I'm going to go and find a Justice of the Peace and I have to write a document that says I own the car okay and then the justice of the peace through their order of the governor of New South Wales will witness that and then we need to try and get a receipt from him saying that he swapped his thing for a car for a Matchbox car show the paper Wheels car and then I need to get my my just of the piece affidavit and the Hot Wheels receipt and take that back that's where we're at I've got to go find a dust of the piece I was I was good with it until the Hot Wheels thing though I just got so confused come on I never understand the whole I just hey maybe it's worth money so it is a whole new day a new day of we're on our way back to serves New South Wales with all of the paperwork that their website said we needed plus the additional paperwork that is not mentioned anywhere but a person at the counter told us that we needed please tell me you brought your diagram so if we need to explain how this whole thing works you can see it um Martin just a quick idiot check yep what we need our PDF form application yes Improvement of identity yes our organization or business details if applicable yes yes we need our CTP green slip yes that one the trick with that which we've been caught on before is to be setting up new registration get a receipt number on your CTP even though you've paid it ring your bring your insurance say make sure it's got a receipt number Shannon's will do it for you and it has the VIN of the car and the receipt number then they can make sure it's actually been paid otherwise their theory is you might just be waving around a random document that doesn't actually exist yes exactly uh we got the receipt from the original owner and authorized unregistered vehicle inspection report which is what we call a blue slip your payment they'll get the payment once they do it yep the number plates uh will be given to us once the vehicle is re-registered plus statutory declaration that says I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm that I own this 180sx and then I've taken that to a Justice of the piece untrue and witnessed that I have claimed because I do own this car so um on our way to service New South Wales not at this point I just don't know anymore I've registered so many cars over the years over 20 years of driving so many second-hand cars imported cars unregistered cars I've never ever ever been told that I need to go and get permission from the governor of New South Wales agent as adjusted the piece never no neither anyway uh we're heading on down now and we'll let you know how we go right well everybody that that did not go as expected at all not at all mostly because we got our recording we are we are legal people we are ready to go on the streets of Sydney Why didn't it go as expected I'll tell you why because we went up to the counter with all of these random things that the person the other day told us we needed and they're like you don't need any of that none of it you just need the stuff off the website that you brought last time that we brought we brought exactly the same paperwork as last time but then we'd also got this um just for the piece thing they didn't want to see it there's like just so just give us the receipt just give us the shows you bought the same stuff the CTP with the receipt number they established registration form granted it was a different person yeah we went to a different counter and the last person said no this person said yes we had all the extra stuff anyway um so I don't know how that works but when we left for Server New South Wales and it says how did we do that person got a five out of five thank you which was a it was a green smiley face how was your feedback how was your session today well my 180s ACT is going to be registered five out of five Service New South Wales and for today compared to 10 years ago they're doing a lot better than they used to let's just put let's just say that that's true it's still not the most pleasant experience but shall we um we can go and put these on the car let's go we got our number plates people and they can finally go on as usual it took longer and was more work than any of us by the two of us that is expected but the outcome I think is also so much better than could have predicted in terms of how clean it looks how nice it looks cleaning up all those little things that sort of niggly things that the project cars of this age always end up biting you in the butt with all that's fixed everything works it drives nice it's downloaded for good numbers nothing leaks out of it yet and otherwise it is pretty awesome it's still untested other than its time on the dyno so who knows how it'll actually go but it is hard to believe that it's the same car that it was a couple of years ago that we bought this took it around the track realized it was just blowing more smoke than Cheech and Chong and then we're like man this car actually needs a bit of love but love is what it got and look at it now like it just this era of cars I'm sure you'll agree with me I just think it really resonates with me I just think it looks great it looks it looks like it has utility you know what I mean a lot of cars these days like Honda Civics and other newer cars just look like robot vomit you know for the sake of robot let's just for the sake of robot it needs to look wild just add some more plastic yeah whereas this is all you've got really good visibility out of a car like this as well one of the best things about these there's so much glass in that turret you can see really well the seating position is nice the dash doesn't get in the way it's really light nice to steer um the only thing really left I guess is a real proper like race spec wheel alignment just so everything is done but that's all been dialed in drives nice yeah it's going to be good so um yeah Martin it is time to put the plate on and time to go for a drive I just I really can't believe how far it's come do you remember what this car used to look like [Music] without you and I know that you could make it on your own but without you without you now [Music] praying for the silence [Music] [Music] [Music] without you and I know [Music] let's go to that 183. yay so here it is finally it's a long time to get to this point now we could have just like done a real quick fix left a plate on and going yay the car works again but it undoubtedly would have blown up in a cloud of Turbo smoke but I think the result is way better with everything being done with the paint and all that sort of stuff as well it's um it is hard to get custom plates in case you couldn't work it out it's 180. 180 anyway um this is well 180 the same thing this 180 as you can see we ordered this in advance and it's the same plate that is on our artwork Martin here it is what's going on take it take take that malt mutton and um put it in there Martin it's yep should be the outside hole oh they fit nice don't they see back when you had your 180 you didn't get a choice of like plate sizes did you no you had to like bend them will cut them and then they got in trouble and that was the only way to make them fit yeah you're on working over there I sort of if you tighten that all the way down it probably won't go in all right still at Lowe's [Music] we're just gonna we're just gonna do this one look at that awesome and it goes getting it all together it's um it's funny you know you don't often get the chance to kind of relive one of your kind of young dreams of like how do I do it again and cars are a really cool way of doing that you know because they are time machines aren't they yeah it is and you get in it and you're just like oh I remember like I remember what it felt like to be back then and you'd imagine that if you are driving around in your first car one of your first cars and you're in your Hyundai i30 whatever it is who's to say in 10 or 20 years you might be like oh man I love that thing it's the memories that you like I know I know it's trippy though right it's the exact same thing because I I have a real soft spot for Gemini's why because my first car was a Gemini I just had some mad adventures and so it's like it's it's definitely a thing man yeah let's go for a drive 20 years time on Mighty Car Mods I-30 rebuilt all right here it is first drive in the 180. it feels good it's really good [Music] I want to hear it not on a dino I'll give you just a little hit man oh wow it sounds amazing that's so good I'm not sure just how low it is yet so I still don't kind of trust any of these it's got to come up a little speed bumps and stuff like I said it had you can do it sink the tune's great man oh it sounds great feels so good [Music] oh it feels just so fun to drive it just you know it doesn't have so much power that you're worried that the back's gonna kick out everywhere it just feels fun and awesome like the right amount isn't it it's great that is everything I could have hoped for and more I'm just I'm starting to get the Red Mist yeah I need to get to our racetrack for a fall absolutely a full Shakedown because I'm feeling myself wanting to do things I can't do in this environment and I'm going to do the right thing and try and contain that because I'm older and more mature now Mark you know it's got more you know it wants it yeah I know I haven't even wound it out yet but that is going to be a story for oh my God unreal it's just it's so nice in here too like we're not liking something where it's got the nice sounds and the nice go it's actually a nice place to be in a 30 year old nugget I know it's so good and this this for me is kind of pretty much going to be a daily this is kind of what I'm going to get around in so I don't want a really really aggressive setup yeah in terms of um how the alignment is set I just want something that is good for the street it's really comfortable there's nothing rattling there's a couple of little things that I can do we need to fix up but I think it's got some some quite stiff bushes in it somewhere maybe in the dip loves it that's red uh this is a pretty awesome car but we are up to the sort of last five percent of just fixing little things like we had an issue with the power steering where it just blew a power steering hose and made it annoying to drive um and also it's just had this really annoying rattle yeah uh and and those are little things that you absolutely want to fix because like it's got a front mount it's got a mad radiator it's got a brand new turbo like a brand new TV 28 yeah from an S15 um so we've done all the stuff to make it awesome but there's a couple of little things that were not great I want to talk uh prices quickly when I bought my first 180sx in probably the late 90s that's how old I am it was four grand so for it was 4 million yeah uh Yen my mates are paying 10 grand in the early 2000s yeah and so now 40 50 60 there was one for 70 a couple of weeks ago absolutely crazy uh but there's a problem with it let's send it up and show you what the issue is my number plate is 180 and anybody that says that it's one bot is a [\u00a0__\u00a0] but that kind of robot vomit number plate is kind of the it's kind of the number plate people have on Hondas right well it's 180 turbo it's that old time but is that one bow then no that's 180. what makes it go from an 8-0 to a b because you've got a consonant following the zero everyone knows that the number plates man it's the non-plate thing everybody it's 180. it's hard getting number plates these days really a bad car because like that's gone is it no because people that are coal rolling like because that's trains or Cummins yeah yeah oh no a Cummins Diesel what are you talking about a Cummins diesel yeah but I'm talking about coal rolling they make it cider too who does Cummins do they can you keep sending my car I'll send my own car up into the sky what else have you seen um clag that was gone [Applause] all right I've fallen both people are driving that's cool um what else moist you can't get can't get moist they've actually got a thing that if it seems a little bit rude they just don't allow you to do it yeah uh which is weird um they decide afterwards they don't like it they reclaim your plate do they really yeah right because remember you tried to get um BG CK yeah up yeah and they were just like nope bad your [\u00a0__\u00a0] up yeah yeah remember yeah do you remember rock yeah anyway let's go we're wasting the internet now sadly properly wasting internet I'm I apologize if you're in the middle of Alaska using a satellite starlink to get the internet right now while trying not to be mauled by a bear I also in these two decades are just talking [\u00a0__\u00a0] wasting your internet really confusing if you had a sheep farm you'd be like why am I sheep making all that noise nah just put the car up watch ready see now everyone with the shape block all right no wrong noise you know we when we swear it magically bars watch this see and all you can hear is a sheep yeah it's bizarre watch that's a goat is it yeah are you [\u00a0__\u00a0] me this whole time I thought it was a sheep did you it's a goat yeah like when I go [Applause] Barrel goats so the exhaust is one aspect of this build that didn't get a whole lot of love because we already had some exhaust components that were on the original car and then we just had to modify them to fit I've just counted all of these components there are 17 different little chunks of pipe to make the whole thing and I've undone a couple of bolts up there to try and accentuate the problem but what you hear is it's so hard mounted it just rubs it knocks it makes the whole car vibrate and so we decided we would fix that with something that I'm about to show you that is freaking awesome you might be wondering why we use this exhaust system in the first place it is the one the car came with at least a good proportion of it is partly because it's already three inch it already fitted we thought it fitted really well we later discovered it actually vibrates and rubs and we thought maybe it had really hard engine mounts and it just seemed like a weird thing but actually the exhaust was rubbing on so many different points it's basically not using the rubbers which is the whole point of the rubbers is to to disconnect that vibration the other thing is kind of hard today to get a good quality 180 SX exhaust in Australia that's and I say good quality like something you'd want to put on a build that's that's had this much effort put in um you can get like cheaper ones but they are very noisy and we didn't want a really loud one and 15 years ago there'd be heaps on the Shelf all over the place but now for money it's kind of a specialized thing now yeah and what a lot of people don't realize is you can get yourself a mad made to order exhaust for this car from Japan check this out this here is a completely custom made exhaust for the 180sx that we got from Japan it is a fujisubo system uh this is not a sponsored video we were proper customers we ordered it and bought it uh it was overnight's plural parts from Japan and the reason that we got one of these is a they still make them brand new and they are made to order but also this is what we got for your Superstar excellent remember how good it was yeah just fit and it was beautifully made and you might be wondering why do they still make this stuff well they don't really leave them on the Shelf the truth is they make these with big CNC mandrel bending machines and just load of programming so your custom order one literally comes through the door as an order they punch it in they get the pipe the pipe goes in the machine gets bent up they do a couple of Worlds and there's your 180sx exhaust system um it's kind of cool that that manufacturing is still a thing and also they can do it so inexpensively because I guess Labor's a bit cheaper but also the machines have come so far because they get this made from scratch custom in Australia with our labor rates is like thousands of dollars there was also a period of time remember when I was saying that you could get kind of a 180sx for 405 Grand then an exhaust maybe half the cost of your car whereas now we're talking about it being five percent of the cost of your car so there's actually a business case for them to make it um I actually can't remember what we ordered I hope it's a turbo back system otherwise we're getting a little bit uh a little bit custom with it but we and you are about to find out let's see what we got that's a Cat-Back isn't it um that's I don't know I don't know is the answer there might be another box that has the rest of it in it though we're gonna have a look We've Ended up with a Cat-Back system which is okay because it means we'll be able to replace the main Frankenstein section of the pipe and make the fujitsubo work with whatever is still left hanging off the turbo there's actually a while ago that we ordered this exhaust so I couldn't remember exactly what it was that we ordered so that is a Cat-Back system but we can add it to the dump here it's already got a performance three inch system that's going from the turbo back anyway so this bit and this bit is actually not [\u00a0__\u00a0] so we're going to keep all of that the rest of it can go in the bin and uh we're just going to make sure that it all fits up and particularly fits with our aftermarket bar because it's a Vertex bar it's kind of everything's a bit wider and bigger just to make sure that it fits so um we will leave this on here take it off from there put it up see if it works and we might have to fabricate some stuff or it might just fit so uh let's find out together foreign [Music] coming off with this amazing exhaust hanger tool thank you humble mechanic for showing us that all right exhaust that is but Martin you did a great job with some of this look at this remember this here I remember we had to get that distance right to make sure that it would actually move out far enough but I got a feeling kind of a similar issue aren't we that if we lay this down we're gonna have to move those mounts further back for the tip to be in the same spot part of the issue is you actually run into the end of the car like there's metal under there that means you're exhaust can go so far so potentially you have to extend your tip or whatever but we'll just have to fit it up and have a look it is made for a Type X but maybe not with the massive kit on the back of it you can see where the rear of the car like the bump is meant to attach to this and it is that much difference like that's how much fatter it is and I reckon if you come with me I reckon that is going to be the difference between that and that look at that so that is the distance that's how much fatter a Vertex bar is going to be so yeah we might have to take these off and move them and but then that won't be long enough oh no we'll work it out the new system looks so good compared to the old one and the quality of the build is exceptional but we've now realized that we don't have everything we need because we don't have a new catalytic converter both of these exhaust systems are three inch performance exhaust systems the main difference being that the new fujitsubo one doesn't have 50 000 different cuts and welds in it there's also a bit more muffling to be done here you can see there's a bit more size here instead of this kind of Canon style Outlet then we've got our bends down here we've got a resonator and then down here we've got a bunch more pipes and then a catalytic converter what I don't have on this one because of what we bought is a catalytic converter so that would normally mean having to order something or if your mates are been working on his lavogue and you're really really desperate for a high flow cat you could get something like this dude that's my shot you can get something like this that is uh from this Subaru levorg and even though this is a whole piece you can see where it goes from the turbo back you can just chop this off your Subaru project excuse me so we can just chop this now the thing to check is if this flange here actually fits see if it does this becomes quite a simple job you could just drive it like that that just see that fits so all we need to do is get this is this is like an Nvidia exhaust nice system we're going to chop it right there excuse me mate you all right we're just gonna we're gonna give it a chop right there we're going to add it to the rest of the fujisubo system that's mine and then um you're still talking that's my [\u00a0__\u00a0] it tells us take it this is our [\u00a0__\u00a0] can I have it yeah thank you if you buy me a burger I'll buy you a burger but it has to be a nut burger a sanitarian not Burger veggie burger without avocado because like you might have seen in our recent episode when we took our Hilux out avocados aren't vegan anymore I know I do avocado what I do avocado it's up on the Hoist holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] um I'm stealing this from Martin's lavogue I'm cutting it I'm sticking his Subaru [\u00a0__\u00a0] on my madness and can you put put yours in the back I can't it's going to go sideways my the preference here is to go sideways it's gonna it's gonna slide in the best because it's got the this hole's quite highly tight I'm gonna put two in the front are you pretty sticking your thumb in that one ah hold on stick your thumb in a dude seriously but can you if I hold this big pipe and then can you just push from behind because I'm holding my hands squash my fingers it's very tight on it dude you're hitting this I think I'm in the wrong hole hold on now you've got the no it's the right hole oh it's just a different different rubber ah there it is to go completely sideways yeah it's just hard to get it through the first bit hang on hold on now you you stick your fingers on that bit we'll do it together three two one go yes dude it's hanging there perfectly there we go that's great so now let's get the next piece on cool do we need to use the little um Ring The Ring Thing this one I'm assuming that's what it's for it looks like a ring you put around the base of it and then yeah sort of helps it why did I use that in sort of like a gasket I guess that is a gasket right you get a bit of movement on it I'm guessing maybe we dropped something all right so now that one there you go oh I know that so that doesn't need a it doesn't need a normal gasket because that is the gasket put that on and then we will measure up the rest ah chill out there's another rubber you can put it through on this bit which might help it's holding it up man oh there we go all right and I'll nut through this one so that can stay a bit loosey-goosey for now and when we'll make up our little pipe so if we measure that out just with a measuring tape that actually looks straight like it won't be much angle but the orientation of the flange will change look at that I forgot the end of the Mighty Car Mods uh these are our measuring tapes I forgot they're magnetic dude that's awesome well that just holds on so that is exactly being Japan I'm going to keep going in centimeters mutton that's 31 centimeters exactly all right [Music] some money [Music] I've welded it on my welding is not fantastic but it is functional and uh doesn't appear to have any holes in it where it can leak so now we put the flange on it and then we can put it all back together [Music] converter thanks to the levorg is now in place thank you lavogue thank you to all our Subaru friends um and straight away the biggest change is doesn't hit anything before that'll go ah remember you must soon as you moved it it's perfect it fits really nice and that's aftermarket sway bar as well which don't always fit exactly the same as Factory um I'm really happy with that that's great we bring it down yeah bring it down I got to put a couple of bolts back in the top of the dump um off the back of the turbo and then we'll just um check everything else up there because there was an exhaust leak and we didn't know where it was but since looking at that exhaust there are a couple of little holes and stuff in there so that will fix that we'll check the front and then um yeah Happy Days people due to our fat aftermarket bumper bar we're probably gonna have to extend the tip but for now we're going to finish the install so we can go for a test drive the exhaust is on we've spanner checked everything under here just around the manifold our dump and the Turbo so now people it's time to go for a drive see what it sounds like [Music] it's not often in life when you get the chance to do over something that didn't go right the first time and my original s13 from when I was a kid well those dreams went up in smoke literally so to have the chance to do it again and do it right was an opportunity that I was going to take and hold on too tight with both hands of course I couldn't do it by myself but with the help of a few mates along the way and a whole lot more time than we expected this project truly did become my 180sx dream build foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] fan base ability and historical significance of Japanese cars from the 1990s there is nothing that even comes close to the 180sx and that my friends is a fact well yeah that's all true unless you've got something that will destroy all Nissans"

convenience store iced coffee it's a rough start because our uh internal clocks are still operating in Florida time so we're waking up I guess not at Florida time but we're working about four a.m in the morning so a little tired but as long as I'm awake for the driving part it's all good well made it to the track and uh what do you know two uh two boys looking in a super engine bay I tell you what it does smell like burning oil yeah fast tech today yeah that's new I don't like that you're driving too fast got the battery loose hey so where's the the that oil so the whole the problem is anything like something on these engines it just goes onto the headers so it just exaggerates every single time yeah it's probably just a valve cover leaking onto a header quick pit stop for a little bit of hayaku mountain filled the tank up gonna go up to North because Nishi is closed today we started the day off with some chill tandy's up you know [Music] what's up Grant what's the early morning routine look like for a fine young gentleman is yourself fuel tires put my back bumper on I got ripped off how'd that happen uh you or Jimmy I can't remember it's okay though it's just held on by zip ties it's supposed to happen things like this are supposed to happen Adam sir Jimmy what does that morning preparation look like for you uh tires could have empty all stuff out of the car because we put everything in the car the night before uh you need to go get gas I would love to do a little change but you know that's cute it is it's adorable isn't it um nice looking Ricky got here not bad and you know you guys are really you know painting a picture for me it looks so good it looks like there's a safari cars down there pay me like a war-torn episode card it was good I I hit you yesterday and then when we came back around I was like oh man that was gonna hit me really hard now and I did yeah that's the best I love it when someone like gives you a tap because then it's like fair game it's like all right pretty sure I've said to myself game on as soon as I get tapped I'm like all right let's go oh yeah that's when he turns his boosts up no it's already up all the way don't worry all right we'll check in with salmon over here what is that early morning preparation routine look like for yourself uh check tires warm up the diff well warm up the defend the transmission because I'm sick of blowing those and then uh GoPro and ready to ride do some laps today yeah yeah on your door oh it's a GOI yeah [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] I was like uh I went off track but I like held into it I'm just glad we didn't all go off track that would have been spicy that was good but we're trying to be due diligent today and keep our tires cool to make them last got a little over excited yesterday and we were just frying through them they look brand new but they'd be heat cycled so this makes them last a lot longer see all the steam coming off of them thank you foreign [Applause] you know what I liked about it though it wasn't a quantity session it was a quality session like we we did four laps took a little break cooled our tires on four laps took a little break usually it's just like America it's like a marathon or no wait no it's like a Sprint it's like a Sprint usually we did a marathon we still probably did 30 or 40 laps but take break keep the cars cool we don't want them to break we don't want to pop tires it's crazy because you could probably do like 10 laps on a set of tires just driving all in a row or you could do 30 if you take your time we're on the same set from this morning yeah it's crazy it's and we I still have Tire left so keep going after lunch all right we're gonna get some psghetti today some spaghetti forgot to get the obligatory shot yeah it looks it looked a lot better in the beginning Japanese spaghetti it hits different here does it hit different have you tried it I don't want to eat spaghetti in Japan at a it's a track restaurant it's customary just so you know Italian food is very big it actually is and it's a bit different here too I think we're messing with you why would they have SpaghettiOs restaurant convenience it's an easy thing to make you put it in the water well I thought we were gonna go to Toge but Adam goes look it's not that bad it's just right here look at this it's like a sheet move your hand yeah I got I got my money's worth I know I'm not complaining I just wish we had tires for toga yeah I'm still gonna risk it I don't care I don't want to go drive [Music] all right about to do my first laps out I always do a sight lap here because you never know if someone's like stuck on the side of the mountain or if someone took off some like Boulders or if there's a landslide and just random rocks and gravel on the track it's gonna be a good time though Grant's actually gonna be chasing me we're gonna try to capture some pretty cool footage but this track is not for the faint of heart you got a big drop there a little spot there and the tricky thing as always is Link in this corner we try to come through I think you come wide and you try to drop a tire through here it's very weird but um it's not too bad we'll see how it how it goes but uh have some fun tracks looking pretty clear so far [Music] just gotta get my muscle memory back I usually drive this track pretty conservative I use a lot of handbrake just so I'm not like pushing it edge to edge because then I have a little margin for error if my speed's a little off people tend to go up into that bank a lot of handbrake here all right you ready Grit [Music] let's do it he's like kind of on Scrubs and I'm on Fresh tires so it might be kind of hard for him to keep up this hill just eats Tire unfortunately there's no real way around it wheel work here is very important it's easier to get caught up and ahead of yourself with the wheel work there staying shallow here cool big fast big fast not bad for first stop out I'm pretty happy with it no no no this is what I mean about the areas where I grab a handbrake a little more than I probably need to just kind of keep it safe [Music] pull my tires down now it was a great lap very happy with that we're going to give a following Grand now thank you should be a good time he's going deep oh I let him pull away a little bit too much there I should have stayed on the throttle a little bit more more good line Grant tripping the bushes a little bit it's unbelievable how technical this is to tanomere but I love it it's good fun putting down a great lead [Music] people I would feel confident chasing first go on together [Music] that was great hell yeah that was good fun I love toe guy I remember when it was a challenge just for me to link the course myself it's crazy to think like me and Grant just tandemed our first two laps until gay after not driving here for almost a year I love that [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] thank you got a little greedy and got into the curbstone looks like I bent my tire out a little bit I'm going on a North so I got to change that uh that tired I was like go do some backies [Music] [Applause] little mod on the Subaru before I leave today I was able to score an almost perfect condition 22b wheel so I felt like that was a perfect upgrade for this hopefully it feels a little bit better but I do feel like I need like some sort of spacer to space the wheel out more I just hate this style wheel it looks like it belonging like a Maxima unfortunately I've learned that not only is a clock spring different which I'm gonna have to put back in now but this trim part is different too for the 2020 to the 22b so the steering wheel doesn't work unfortunately big sad it bothered me that this trim was painted in this car so I was able to Source what would have come in it this cool blue color well this one's faded a little bit so maybe I'll still quest to find another one for the meantime I'll have these and then I'll find some better ones I guess not perfect and I gotta change the plaque to the one that came with the car but at least it's blue like I wanted it to be it's the first day of Matsuri and I got into basically just driving all day and having a lot of fun so here's some GoPro footage of driving and having a lot of fun I didn't Vlog because I was having that much fun because that story is awesome it's when all the foreigners come it's when all the locals come everyone drives has a blast thank you foreign [Applause] foreign okay you saw that now it's night and we're going up to North Course to do some night laps just gonna Shred with Grant I don't like driving at night that much but I can't resist and it's fun and it makes for cool videos so it's got some fun for having broken headlights these things actually work pretty good it's so sketchy driving here at night [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] foreign myself I was just talking to Andy about how this has been the most beautiful trip my car had to skip the beat no mechanical issues next session out there I think I broke some of the internal shifter related I don't think it broke the gearbox I think I just shipped it too hard and broke something I took a quick Gander and it's not anything externally that I can see without putting it up in the air but it looks like it goes in all the gears first second third fourth fifth but the weirdest part clutches in clutch works but even when the car is in neutral it'll stall so it's like it's not pulling it out of gear how it's supposed to I don't know if maybe I bend something or something's Twisted but hopefully it's not a gearbox that would suck it's day two of Matt Surrey I'm lucky because I dropped off my power vehicles last night to get the gearbox taken uh I should say taking a look at but take it out because I definitely broke a shift selector so they luckily had a refreshed one that they're tossing in I should be good to drive in an hour kind of give it some time to reflect and I'm so hard on myself as a driver and every time I come here I want to progress I want to drive better and better and better and at a certain point it gets harder to keep improving without just crashing because already past trips I've been like grazing bumpers on transitions so although I've had some pretty amazing runs in the past I feel like this trip my consistency has gone up a lot which I feel good about rather than having a 10 out of 10 run a 6 out of 10 Run 10 out of 10 runs seven out of 10 run I feel like this trip we've been like running consistent nines both on leads and chases both with just like fluidity consistently putting the car in the same spots consistently being a good distance on all Corners in the chase Jason it's really great practice because the cars here are so slow and so loose that it makes you have to be perfect with all of your inputs and have timing down on point where back home the cars have a little bit more grip a little bit more drive so you can kind of get away with being sloppy and catch back up but I'm not gonna lie I'm pretty excited turning all these laps here and then going right into our world Tour event back home in E-Town because we will be running cars will be a bit more loose and I think a lot of the driving mode do translate pretty good there but I'm really stoked for collab because she's been shredding Jimmy's been shredding grain's been shredding we're gonna have some serious driving going on and I'm excited to see it car is back it's looking good she's ready to rip damage wise the car pretty much looks in the same exact State the rear lip did come off the other day and I got a couple new drift stitches on it a couple self tappers it's very windy and cold uh yeah I guess that's pretty normal here nice dress yeah dress custom fit for me that's a prototype yeah maybe release May not I don't know yeah yeah comment below if you want Elsa must dresses one of the most hectic things in that Surrey is uh the last Nishi short session where everyone just gets chaotic you see like 30 car trains and I feel like the Snippets that you guys see in videos don't really do it justice so what I'm going to do I'm gonna include some clips in this video like I normally would but I think I'm gonna have a separate upload that's like maybe like 30 minutes or an hour of just uncut door-to-door action Chase lead multiple cameras just so you can get the the full perspective of the experience I know they have a live stream of the track but I still feel like it doesn't give the the chaos proper it doesn't do it proper justice so uh yeah we'll do that have some fun and take you guys along for the ride how many laps in a row can I get a tire mark once you do that I got my ass rolled I'll play ketchup down the hill dangerous spot to play ketchup [Music] three last in a row tire mark let's go [Music] it's like watching through him because that car run run I'm nervous if they stop he stops and we all pile up big danger [Music] got a wild Colette Davis up there let her lead [Music] her car looks so cool [Music] break oh God that scared me butt Pucker [Music] foreign I don't know what's going on but my driving right now is uh the most calculated maybe I'm focused a little bit too much on talking to you guys a lot of butt puckering going on I'm getting ready to put my car in storage I have to turn the last lap me and Jason actually just tanned him all the way down the hill up north I wish I was filming but my GoPro was at a battery I'm going through my center console there's so much old chain stuff in here there's really still broken glass from when musker hit me and smashed my uh passenger window old school LZ BMX lanyard still in here from probably the first time I ever came here random GoPro stuff just cleaning around that way when I come back it doesn't stink too much hopefully we'll steal the change it's still worth money use it for tolls rare find even my old student ideas in here hey Grant my old student ID is in my car how funny is that [Music] why Maybe someone will not maybe I got a discount for being a student yeah I'm your teacher really saving those dollars for accounts Grant we were actually planning to drive tomorrow but it turns out that pretty much every track is closed except for school in Toge so we're actually cutting the strip we're actually cutting the trip a little bit earlier than expected but it's still a great way to end the trip had a lot of fun I got old girl loaded to the brim with probably like 35 different wheels and tires all my spares and now we actually are going to have a little bit more free time than we thought we're gonna hang out Tokyo with the boys and uh you know just chill foreign [Music]"

than a Corvette convertible or something you know wind buffeting and everything and you're low enough below that windshield so you're not having your head out over there exactly foreign featuring today 1932 Ford Roadster this is what I call part of our street grab series sometimes we're driving around or I see something with one of my buddies or one of the guys in the shop hey I saw this car was really cool I met the guy you got to have him on the show and that's what this was this car was uh voted uh outstanding engineering most outstanding engineering at the Grand National Roadster Show uh if you're familiar with that you know it's it's cars from all over the world not just the United States the best Builders they all compete and uh to be noticed at that Roadster Show and be given sort of that that honor is pretty amazing and the thing I like about it is just the posture of this car it sits right it looks right it looks like a 32 Ford and it looks like maybe it has a flat head with three strombergs on it I don't know what it's got you know but all I know is I just like the cut down windshield and it's not overdone you know sometimes they say 32 forwards and I go what does that used to be and they go well it was the 32 floor and I go oh okay maybe in 32 but it didn't look anything like a 32 for it now which is exactly what this does it just feels like this car could have been done in the late 50s or early 60s maybe the exception of the colors which are somewhat contemporary let's meet the owner Joe coogle Joe come on in nice job on this sir thank you Jay really really something so thank you and this has been what a six year project it was a six-year project yeah and your wife's still talking yeah yeah yeah she is okay so so what do we have here it's a steel body car obviously yes okay all steel so what got us bent uh outstanding engineering because to most people it looks just like a 32 Ford which is what it's supposed to obviously it's lower and I can see little touches but give me some of the features that make it out well it's a fully independent suspension chassis that's what we do that's our our business you build chassis for uh yeah for uh street rods hot rods and trucks we do suspensions independent suspensions for the cars and uh so this car is basically has a lot of features of a new car it's got power power steering power brakes air conditioning heat air conditioning I mean you have no windows yeah no but you know how you're a rich guy you know I just have the air conditioner so you so you're cooling you're you're doing global cooling just by running this yeah yeah well yeah when it's 100 degrees out here I won't have to think twice about taking my Roadster for a cruise so it's just it's just blowing cold air yeah okay yeah so when you're at a stop light it's nice feeling that cold air all right okay I'll take that and what motor are you using it's a 427 cubic inch Ford Cleaver I never heard that expression before and explain what Cleaver means yeah well Cleaver is uh it's essentially a boss 302 but right it's a Windsor block with Cleveland heads and it's a Cleaver and they call it a Cleaver yeah okay very cool and you made it to what transmission trance is a manual five-speed McLeod five-speed transits and what cylinder engine are you running under here it's our own independent rear suspension we use a four nine inch gear set but we make everything else we do the housing the ax arms and what gear ratio running in there it's a 389. 389 okay that's an unusual one yeah okay and what kind of horsepower are you making here yeah this is about 5.75 okay close to Six so really streetable runs on pump gas right pump gas and brakes or what uh we use Wilwood uh calipers and rotors uh we use those essentially on all of our suspension kits can we open it up here and take a look at the engine absolutely foreign all right now what do we have here that's is that carburation or tricky fuel injection that is tricky fuel injections it looks like Weber's but yes that's the nice thing with the the borla set up they make them look like the old 48s but that's fuel injection to me there was nothing sexy when I was a kid than a 289 Mustang or Cobra or Sunbeam Tiger absolutely with the Weber absolutely and they do look like I had to look for a minute I kind of knew it was a fuel injection I thought well maybe do you buy it as a crate or is it a put together and this one is a put together okay it's a Dart Block Edelbrock heads right and then to make the Windsor intake manifold that borla makes to mate to the Cleveland Heads was a kind of a job so price Motorsports makes adapter plates to adapt The Windsor intake to a Cleveland head and what is this weigh well 2500 pounds that's closer to three it is yes okay and here we're using this as an overflow that is the Overflow for the radiator okay runs pretty cool doesn't it it does 195. it's gotten over 195 a couple times but it goes right back down and what steering box is that so that's our rack and pinion steering right that we use our nurse suspensions uh Flaming River rack oh yeah I've heard it I'm sure now that the heat off that manifold doesn't affect your steering no right it doesn't I wonder if you need it yeah of protection because the time A lot of times I put the the box right next to the manifold the boy literally boils the floor in the box and then oh yeah yeah I mean this is the whole when I was a kid Chrome was the deal yeah the holders head Cobra and the valve cars now everybody goes from this minimalist sort of look it's just this is my third 32. I've done a couple others um and they were shiny yeah polishing I got tired of cleaning around you could tell I got tired of cleaning yeah stainless steel and aluminum it is funny how hot rods go through periods like now we're in the periods of the matte black matte white which to me I I like something to shine to me I like to do something and then stand back and look at yeah my efforts you know I see so many stuff now it's all matte black but I like this and I like and the this sort of terracotta would this be it's not red they call it Vermilion red it's a BMW M series leather oh Vermilion red so and whose steering oil is that uh it's custom made by Mike Curtis Curtis speed uh that was a chunk of aluminum and uh machined it and I wanted a 356 style Porsche steering wheel right as you can see the interior mimics a 356 Porsche that's why I got the seats and the shifter and the gauges how long has this been done just finished this year just finished two weeks ago before the Grand National Roadster Show I had about a hundred miles on it before then before I had the upholstery done but uh had the upholstery done the day before the show I bolted on the steering wheel and uh had you drive did you like it beautiful yeah I out of the box I'm pretty happy with it yeah yeah and obviously people can buy this package from you they can get the chassis that's the whole deal I guess oh yeah yeah I'm so glad it's steel and not fiberglass yeah it's a Brookville body Brookville Ohio they reproduce the 32s so it's basically essentially a stock 32 Ford although stock 32 Ford fenders are there a bit wider no their stock originally original sizes yes yeah and you have an actual trunk right yes there you go there we go uh this is the battery here and this is the electronics for the whole car oh so fuses and everything right there yeah so very good so I can get to it yeah you know fuses usually they're stuck under the dash and you can't get to them and you build the whole chat what what's a rolling chassis rolling chassis with our front independent front and Rears around 20 to 25 000. and what is the wheelbase it's 106 and a half 106 and a half okay is there any other bodies that fit on this besides the 32 Ford or all 32 bodies all 32 sedans Coupe what are the handles in here oh I have uh little tubby holes oh I see so I have some tools oh very good and over here I got some cleaning stuff right right yeah cool this panel right here is essentially the inside of the wheel tub that's why I could fit a 295 55 tire back there so I did a mini tub on the body so is it roasted show like Pebble Beach you stand all of a sudden guys come um um no no they don't no they don't do a point system oh they don't for judging for America's most beautiful Roadster no it's just uh handle that as well correct yes I was a contender for that yeah so they're just a panel judges I think nine or ten of them and you know sometimes I wish they'd call it America's most practical Roadster because a lot of times I see ones I remember years ago seeing Chrome brake rotors and I go well all right the first time you step on the brake you scored the whole you can't really drive it like this looks like something yeah you could drive it to the show buff it get the trophy and drive home again absolutely and that's to me that's that's the fun part when you make something that's such a show car that oh God you yeah you don't get near it don't get finger marks on it you know well in the week and a half or two weeks since the show I've put over 300 miles on it yeah now you don't have a top do you not yet no you're gonna ran out of time would you make like a Carson top like a hard top it'll be a soft top would you have Windows that drop in or what no not yet that might be a something to do later yeah I have to add add Windows not quite hearing that window thing just yet this fancy window thing now you've got a heater as well as it yes okay of course whose unit is that is that vintage a vintage aren't they good I use them on everything it's small they're light they're compact yeah you know fit in all the foreign cars the Lamborghinis whatever you know they're really really are amazing yeah because like my Lamborghinis from the 60s so the afternoon giant Frigidaire unit I mean it's ridiculous it doesn't cool at all yeah and theirs is only like this big yeah they're pretty compact yes and that was another reason why I wanted the Windsor block yeah is they do a front runner kit that bolts to that that can handle the air conditioning compressor and the power steering pump so I'm surprised you needed it did you need uh power steering you don't need it but it's nice yeah it's nice yeah especially if you're trying to park it it is yeah when you set out to build something like this do you sketch the whole thing out on paper is it when you take six years it is you go along you try one dash kind of like that Dash or do you have it all in your head what it's going to look like and it looks like exactly what you thought it was six years ago yeah exactly well I had this idea in my head yeah and you know I I can't draw right to save my life but I have a friend who does renderings and I had him do exactly what I wanted six years is a long time to where you want to maybe think of different colors or different ideas but uh from the get-go and also my take on this was to bring a little bit of a newer car Vibe with the colors and the dark wheels right on an old car change it up a little bit Yeah contemporary attitude a little yeah yeah I mean back in the oldest you would have like these sort of metal flake stripes with the you know which seemed cool back in the 60s now you're kind of go yeah you know so it's fun well I know all the engineering in the chassis can we put it up on the lift and take a look that'd be great yeah let's do it all right let's bring it next door and then we'll take it for a ride [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] well we've got it up on a sterile County lift wow look at this wow this is very impressive thank you boy it looks like one of those Twilight ceilings you know you get in the cars like the little stars of all these all these polished pieces under here wow wow yeah all the all the hardware is polished stainless and look at this chassis this is very nice now your dad started this business correct yes yes he did okay um 69 he started Google components oh okay yeah mostly chassis stuff or whatever yeah what he did was he had a installation kit for Jaguar independent front end and the Jaguar independent rear suspensions for 32s oh that's what started oh sure sure and then when those kind of ran dry he says why don't I make my own independent front end and then later came the rear well I mean just the fact they've ridden this driven this car three or four hundred miles I mean it's not a weeping there's I mean I can't see a drop of oil and there are gaskets if there's no oil in it it's amazing yeah it's really unbelievable it's just nicely done and this is your your own design here on this yeah yeah are these are like track these traction bars these are the radius rods our radius okay oh yeah yeah okay this is basically if you if you look at it it's very similar to the Jaguar independent rear end right it's got the inboard disc brakes like the Jags oh it's got four shocks and springs like the Jags and then this is the radius rod and then they have the pinion bars that go up to the front very nice now when they judge it for something like the Roadshow do they actually get under it do they see this no well it's a shame I mean this is really yeah and look at the front end just as pretty yes coil over shocks and springs here's the big six piston Wilwood calipers right right right power rack and then back here is the Hydro Boost power brake system with the Wilwood master cylinder right and there's a clutch master cylinder it's hydraulic just the way the whole exhaust system goes together here you know I'm used to gobs of Permatex coming out of it boy just nicely done thank you I even got uh exhaust cutouts here so we could hear the motor yeah a little obnoxious sounding but see that's so like I like this kind of guys where our clothes are filthy dirt easy but oh the underside of the car fabulous fabulous it's unbelievable yeah well it really is impressive thank you I mean this is boy there's a lot of bird cage working here isn't there yeah it really it really it looks fairly light but it looks really strong you've got so much bracing here yeah well it really allows the the frame to be rigid right and let the independent suspension do the work and this is a crossover pipe yeah and then you've got this here to to hold your drive shaft from coming down yeah and breaking off is that both oh that's part of the chassis that is part of the frame yeah okay oh that's really nice so a lot of these ideas go back to your dad correct yes yeah absolutely yeah your dad's still with us oh yeah oh that's great he's at the shop right now he's working 83 83 okay cool 84 next month maybe when he's 100 you'll let them retire or something right well that's impossible he'll never retire it's gonna say too he says food out here having fun eating sandwiches when it's your hobby you don't retire well it's your life it's not your hobby Yeah well yeah well tell him he does just beautiful work because nothing like this kind of old school stuff it's really really sophisticated and and this is really sort of outrageous engineering for hot rods back when your dad started because it's just a 32-4 with a 49er but that was it you know that's right the idea of making all the sophisticated stuff is really really something yeah well when he came out with the Jaguar installation kits for independent yeah him and gray Baskerville did A Rod and Custom shootout between Grays right right a straight axle compared to his independence so it's kind of neat yeah very cool so you got to get one of these lifts now I know it's pretty impressive let's take it for a ride absolutely see how that suspension works yeah it's got a 0.63 overdrive good here it's a big drop from four to five so six here about what 2200 RPMs uh 70s 2200 oh wow yeah yeah about 6 68. foreign Porsche horns nice thing about these engine avoid gearing you could pass right you don't have to downshift right unless you just want to show off that's why I wanted to 389s 390s basically got some pep didn't have that nice nice Overdrive on the freeway [Music] nice thing about this you can drive it like a regular cars it's not peaky you're not yeah we're on the brake and the gas at the same time and all that kind of that's right 460 miles yeah going forward with the backup lights on didn't put any kind of sound system in it it's got a Bluetooth oh I just hook your phone up to it yes I got speakers right back that's the way they do it so yeah I don't want to see any stereo or anything eventually I'll put a tray across there because I love a parcel train it just ran out of time but uh that'll be coming next is that a cancel button at the end of the star that's the high beams oh yeah yeah it'll self cancel [Music] yeah you got your arrow there so yeah it's like the old Porsches how off are you in the passenger seat I'm not gonna say amber I'm sure I'll get my son in this thing driving so that'll happen twice three to six six or five five so just yeah oh yeah you're in third right I think yeah yeah I don't know how much Casters in the front end yet yeah I've been taking the alignment shop so but just for my driving it so far I think I need to put more casters to get it it's a little light on the front end right right that's just dialing in brakes are great foreign very nice very comfortable thank you I know different than a Corvette convertible or something you know okay and everything right and you're low enough below that windshield so you're not having your head out over there exactly yeah yeah hard to beat four-wheel independent suspension I know [Music] it was a hard sell for Americans for a long time I mean Mustang 10 years ago came out with it it's a solid axle I suppose you just drag racing all the time solid axles as good as anything but yeah exactly but this I built for Comfort right you know I'm not it's not a canyon Carver I call it a canyon Cruiser right right drive this thing for hours and hours it doesn't beat you up exactly that's what I plan to do too I'm driving these things how many gallon gas tanks you got 15. oh that's good [Music] yeah but you're about what 2 600 pounds 27 huh yeah [Music] the scenes are very comfortable these are um fiber Steel seats uh reproduction of the 356 Porsche oh okay [Music] and my upholstery guy I go you got to put some lumbar in there for me yeah I need lumbar so you put just a you know that's the key to good suspension you turn it and the wheel doesn't start hopping yeah so many guys come with stuff oh I've got to fix that you know yeah yeah well that's what people see this car and they say you know it's got a rub I got no nothing wrong right tires it's it's engineered in you know it's nothing rubs no we can't sit that low I could win trust me nothing rubs steering it's a little it's a little one or maybe pressure which I could do with valves right in the pump so so that's all dilating that's what you do to drive it for you know yeah you start driving then you can fine tune what's good yeah that's awesome but no drama just nice all the way through yeah you really feel the squat yeah yeah guys well Joe's out here man watching a beautiful car here thank you this is probably one of the most finished cars we've ever tested that's real because a lot of people bring stuff when it's 80 gone or yeah 90 done and little things don't work and whatnot but this drives nice handles nice more than enough power I mean Jesus thank you yeah I mean yeah we only touched this gear once just just to see what it was like yeah right probably gets pretty good mileage too it actually does yeah yeah employee is so lightweight yeah well I sure appreciate this Jades well go to what's your website again uh Google components.com go to Google components.com that's with a K and uh check out this it's really nice work nicely done nothing flashy but it is kind of flash but not in a flashy way that's right that's the way flashy but not in a flashy way yeah so Joe thank you very much my friend I appreciate it and thanks for an opportunity to drive this through the car oh it's really impressive hey see you guys next week hope you like this"

      "name": "Engineering Explained",
      "corpus": "hello everyone and welcome in this video we're talking about how the engines and power units in Formula One are going to be changing for the next generation of cars now if you've already seen my video on how the current engines work well the basic architecture is very similar it's still a 1.6 liter V6 turbocharged engine however in the future it's going to be making significantly less power so the really big change coming to the engines is how the fuel flow is going to be limited so it's going to go from a mass flow limit to an energy flow limit So currently the engines are limited to a fuel flow rate of 100 kilograms per hour that's going to switch in the 26th season to 3 000 megajoules per hour now these are difficult numbers to compare right they're different units so it's like well what does this all mean well let's translate this into a maximum theoretical power assuming you had a hundred percent thermal efficiency well a fuel flow rate we calculated in our previous video of 100 kilograms per hour gives you a maximum power of about 2 1240 kilowatts three thousand megajoules per hour that's about 833 kilowatt hours per hour in other words 833 kilowatts so you can see that number significantly less and because we're operating at let's say about 50 thermal efficiency for these engines and then we switch over into units of horsepower because some people like units of horsepower we have about 830 horsepower in the current generation engines versus about 560 horsepower in the next generation of engines all a result of that limited energy flow now we're also going to have less fuel So currently they have about 100 to 110 kilograms of fuel that they can store and in the future cars that's going to be about 70 to 80 kilograms of fuel that they can store now there's some really interesting differences with how the fuel is regulated currently versus how those rules are going to change so for example currently there is no octane number number maximum for the fuel So in theory your fuel flow is limited to 100 kilograms per hour but if you were to have a higher octane fuel then you could make more power using that same fuel flow additionally there isn't anything exactly specific saying hey your energy density must be this so if you have a higher energy density fuel well again that means you're injecting more energy with your fuel flow limit and thus can make more power so both of these are levers that you can play with yes fuel is very tightly controlled so it's not a huge lever but it is a lever that you can lean on a little bit to get a little bit more extra performance out of your vehicle well that kind of goes away because now for 26 there is a limit on the octane number a maximum which cannot exceed 102 research octane number and also because you have this energy flow limit say you have a more energy dense fuel well great maybe you save a little bit of weight but that doesn't mean your engine can make more power because again you're limited in energy flow not mass flow for your engine now a few additional points about the fuel that are very interesting currently there is a minimum amount of oxygen by mass that you must have in the fuel of 3.45 percent now why is that interesting well Gasoline by itself does not have oxygen in it so you have to have something added to it for example ethanol so ethanol you can see the chemical equation there is oxygen in it and oxygen by mass is about 35 percent of the weight of ethanol so if you need about 3.5 percent this is 35 percent by mass well you need about 10 percent ethanol meaning about E10 that would be a valid fuel to use in Formula One currently now that is changing to a range from 3.45 as a minimum to 6.7 to 7.1 percent by mass so we're looking at something like an E20 for the fuels 426 and Beyond and in addition these fuels are going to be sustainable meaning not coming from crude oil you know develop from underground so part of this is like this is this marketing thing right so if you think about the Pyramid of like where do the emissions related to Formula One come from the top of the pyramid would be the cars going around the truck you know it's really not that much uh another layer down in that pyramid you have all the teams flying all over the world in order to make this event happen right and then there's all of us if we actually attend these events you fly you know to Miami or Austin 440 000 people going to Austin for the weekend many driving many flying in that's an insane amount of emissions you know to get everyone to go to that event and view it so that's kind of the pyramid there and when we talk about sustainable fuels it's like okay neat like it's cool to develop that as an idea but it's not really making a huge impact in terms of overall emissions of Formula One now one last point on that fuel flow rate so looking at a graph of fuel Flow versus RPM just like the current season the next generation of cars is also going to have a very similar curve it's going to basically look identical different equation but the overall goal is the same in that at lower RPM you are limited in how much fuel you can use reaching a maximum at 10 500 RPM so that's about where you're going to hit Peak power because yes you can go beyond 10 500 RPM you can get more air but you can't get more fuel so you really can't make more power much beyond that so very similar between current engine and the Next Generation as far as this plot now the other really big change coming to this power unit relates to the electric motor so here we have a simple diagram looking at where we are today versus where we're going so anything in blue is 26 and Beyond versus everything in red here is the current generation of cars and then anything in purple is shared between them so the thing is yes they both have an mguk which is essentially the electric motor that can help power the car and Propel it forward it's attached to the crankshaft so it can send that power directly to the wheels for the next gen car this is making significantly more power 350 kilowatts versus 120 kilowatts so a much larger motor 470 horsepower versus 160. so although the combustion engine is making much less power the car overall is going to be making very similar power at about a thousand horsepower some other big changes here looking at it the energy that you can regen so as you're slowing down using that mguk to put energy from the electric motor into the battery increases from two megajoules per lap to nine Mega joules per left so a lot more energy 2.5 kilowatt hours per lap that you can put back into that battery however you no longer have the mguh so the electric motor that was once attached to the turbocharger which you could use to take energy wasted energy that's going out the exhaust and turn it into useful energy that you could then store in the battery or send to the mguk and help Propel the car that is no longer there so one of the really interesting things about this is Mercedes has previously said the reason why they were able to achieve 50 thermal efficiency with their Formula One combustion engine they would not be able to do it they wouldn't be able to hit 50 without the mguh so it'll be really interesting to see what that efficiency number is for the future generation of cars and also because they no longer have this electric motor attached to the turbocharger that means the return of Turbo lag so turbo lag will now be a thing again I don't think it's going to be that big of an issue because you have this huge you know electric motor which is going to provide you all kinds of torque at low speeds so I don't think it's going to be this you know huge thing as far as a driving concern but it is a variable that's going to come back into play now there's one rule that's very interesting to me that they did not change so yes they're going to allow for more regen and yes they're going to have a significantly more powerful electric motor however the available capacity of the battery is not going to change it's going to remain at four megajoules meaning the maximum state of charge and the minimum state of charge that you ever have within the race that range cannot be greater than four megajoules which is about 1.11 kilowatt hours so that means at any given moment you could never use in a row all at once more than 1.11 kilowatt hours so that brings up an interesting point because okay if you have a small electric motor that doesn't make all that much power 120 kilowatts how long can that run flat out before you use up 1.11 kilowatt hours well that number ends up being about 33.3 seconds so you can run that flat out for 33 seconds well that's a really long time so it doesn't seem feasible that within a lap there's going to be one moment in time where you run flat out for 33 seconds but what is that now for the new motor 350 kilowatts uses up 1.11 kilowatt hours very quickly in just 11.4 seconds so what's the longest straight in Formula One well I went back and looked at look players qualifying lap for 2022 in Baku and there were about 22 seconds that he was accelerating on that long straight and so if you look at these numbers here well it's apparent that hey you can actually run out of energy from your battery before you get to the end of that straight so Vehicles could potentially be power limited on these long straights with the following generation of cars now another really interesting point regarding that power limitation on Long straights for the next generation of cars well you're actually going to reduce the amount of power you can use as you get to higher speeds So Below 300 kilometers per hour you can use up to 350 kilowatts then you have a linear drop as you go from 300 to 340 kilometers per hour from 350 watts to now a maximum of 150 kilowatts so this number could be longer that you can actually run flat out because you drop up the overall limit of power for that motor as you get to higher speeds so if you're coasting you know 350 kilometers per hour well you can only use 150 kilowatts so you know you have a bit more time that you can use it but again you know it's it's rare you get to speeds above this and because they're going to have less power that means it's going to even be more challenging to reach these speeds assuming similar Arrow now I should probably end the video here but I'm not going to because there's something very perplexing about Formula One engines and that's that they run gasoline but they also run very lean and usually those two things do not happen together gasoline engines don't really like to run lean especially when you're trying to make a lot of power and so there's two rules that come with the new regulations that are very interesting to look at one of those being the minimum intake air temperature cannot be less than 10 degrees above ambient so it has to be at least 10 degrees above ambient now you've got a Turbocharger packing a bunch of boost in you're going to become pressing that air yes it's going to run through an intercooler but chances are you know that's pretty tough to do to get it to just be 10 degrees warmer than ambient the other interesting rule is that the intake pressure cannot exceed an absolute manifold pressure of 4.8 bar that's about 70 PSI or about 55 PSI of boost which is very high that's a lot of air and so when I heard these two numbers in the rules it's very interesting to me because it's like okay well if I know how much air they can put into the car and I know how much fuel they can put into the car well then I can calculate a theoretical limit on what the engine is limited at as far as the air fuel ratio how lean can this engine actually run what's the limit that Formula One says you may not exceed this now this gets a little tricky right because we're given a number of energy per hour not mass per hour so it's not easy to do an air fuel ratio calculating the airflow at 10 500 p.m that's very easy to do we did it in the last video on Formula One and so in the example here we're going to be at 2822 kilograms per hour that's imagining we're at sea level the ambient temperature is 15 degrees Celsius and thus our intake temperature is 15 plus 10 so 25 degrees Celsius and we get some air density numbers going into that vehicle all right we've got half our equation solved we just want to divide airflow by Fuel flow to get our air fuel ratio we know our airflow what is our fuel flow well we don't know what the fuel is right so we cannot say definitively but we do know you know looking at the rules for what the fuel must be that E20 could work as a fuel so for the purposes of this we're going to use E20 uh 20 ethanol 80 gasoline now we're just going to say that's what it is it's going to be this weird synthetic blend that they create that is sustainable but we're going to go with E20 here now if you do the math on each 20 and this is your energy flow rate well then that will translate to a mass flow rate of 74.5 kilograms per hour so we take 2822 divide that by 75.4 and that gives us an air fuel ratio of 37.9 to 1. that is very high remember stoichiometric for a gasoline engine it's about 14.71 for E20 that's stoichiometric ideal ratio is 13.5 to 1. so if we take 37.9 we divided by 13.5 that gives us a Lambda of 2.8 so meaning 2.8 times the ideal air fuel ratio a ton of air very very very lean I really doubt the engines will be running at this lean of a ratio now it's worth pointing out this 2.8 number is sensitive to temperature so it is probably rare that you're going to see you know at sea level 15 degrees C ambient temps and your intake temps only 10 degrees higher than that so if you were to have for example something like 70 degrees C intake air temperatures well then that 2.8 becomes 2.4 so that number can go down regardless it seems extraordinarily lean and it doesn't seem to be a limit that will actually affect teams as far as hey are they going to be hitting that up against that and saying oh I wish we could go leaner than that so that to me is really interesting like it's like to me why is this a rule why is there a maximum intake pressure limit of 4.8 bar why do we also have an airflow limit on top of a fuel flow limit because it seems like a real limiting factor here is our energy flow limit for our fuel however this is introduced right and previously there was not this airflow limit whereas now it is there and I don't know why that's there right I don't know what advantage you may be able to have by running more air through the engine or why this rule exists so I find that really intriguing it's like why is it there and I'm not saying it shouldn't exist I just don't know why it does which is a terrible conclusion right thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below"

look at the uh Street Evo used and abused I have taken this thing out and ripped it I'm getting like kind of almost like a charcoaly gray look to the wheels now yeah for a second I thought they were Chrome rolling up a little bit of an update on this this car has to go to clear Customs at some point in the next couple of days then it's gonna get put on a plane and then it's gonna go over to London it's probably gonna sit with our boy Mr jww that's what I'm hoping with James's help we can actually get the car serviced so there's the update on that you haven't gotten it serviced yet I have not got its service but it's gonna sit in London for like two weeks so London Lamborghini or whoever since this we're just burning money at this point able to ship it to Italy for a service send it back to the factory there's no way to drive the best it's ever driven back to the factory yeah that's what we're doing I'm just joking I don't know if these are important but what this piece what is that is off of the Murcielago yeah and it goes on the passenger side front fender inner part to the hood if that makes sense sure it broke off I believe he said they straightened out I almost hit you there bro sharp carbon we're gonna take this and this sorry Doug demira this hood that we brought down from Canada funny enough this was sitting in billionaire Mike Hall you son of trying to steal my Mercy Hood uh it's got a little damage here but I think they can obviously fix that up no problem a little damage here actually cool look when it splits you can see the carbs so they gotta repair this but they're gonna use this to actually line everything up okay they can't finish lining things up until this is put back on the car so right now we're gonna go over and see ayad at King's Auto Body and he wants to talk to me about some of the challenges he's having apparently this car is being a pain in the butt now the thing I wanted to talk to you guys about is a choice I have to make now it sounds easier than it is do I fix the car or do I sell it I know right now everybody's like fix the car but it's going to cost a whole bunch of money and it's gonna take a whole bunch of time I do have a few people that have given me quite I think respectable offers on the Murcielago as is and I do love this car and it's super rare and I always said I'd never sell it almost at a place where for the right amount of money I'd actually be willing to let it go but hold on hold on hold on hear me out because I can take that and get something that I think the majority of you guys the audience would be more interested in for whatever reason most you guys just don't like watching videos on older cars like no one really loved the career GT even though it's like hands down one of the best cars on planet Earth and no one really honestly loves the mercy like I'll make that a title and thumbnail and you guys don't really watch it if you don't watch the videos you know we just can't afford to keep a car if you guys aren't going to watch it so let me know in the comments below do I keep repairing them see or do I sell my baby and just move on and pay the price and make more juicy content for you guys I don't know it's a tough decision it's I'm trying to be real with you guys right now it's part of the business and we'll put this in here oh I just completely smashed that so it was actually the car when I was already bad I like came in hot and was like this all right what how expensive are one of those well one of what it's already wrecked they're gonna fix it don't stress how's she doing not destroyed main tank secondary tank kind of cool eh it is yeah because when they're both full like this thing does go forever gas station challenge yes how much do you thinking 150 bucks I'm going 200. 200 dude if it's 200 you're not getting paid this month you might want to rethink your rethink that one there we go there we go here we go let's see 71 on this one the first one well yeah I don't want to overfill it because I've done that twice and what I've learned see under here in the tires see this filler if you overdo it it'll leave there's somewhere where it's not tight enough and it'll leak I did this last time and it was Dripping diesel in my garage at home well let's see this one's sucking it back we're at 90 oh no way whoa look look look look see is that it no there's no way that's it just as I said that I came shooting out dude diesel stinks got all of your shoes now too yeah well we're done no way no no we were both wrong it was 125 randomly right on the money to fill both those tanks I said well 150 he said 200. 200. so you owe me 75 dollars well at least I still get paid coming out of your salary Mark watch out oh that would have a bad move on his part another crushed Mercedes another correct just drive right over it King's Auto Body Shop where the mercy is and guess what I have someone that's interested in buying the Murcielago but they have a few questions in regards to what exactly is left on that vehicle to be done hey what's up guys good how are you I have a hood be careful it's in many conditions okay I have a little development here yeah FaceTime someone who's actually interested in buying the car as is what yeah we go look at it yeah I'm close all right let's FaceTime this guy too hey Houston say hi to everybody what did you just do all my parts that I've had for the uh for the car in question here so you have you have a whole front end and everything I have it all you need is one of these all I need is the car that's it this could be a match made in heaven right here as you can see they've straightened this all out they do have a whole new front frame this right here we bought this so this is all this is all 100 perfectly in alignment we bring it all the way back to save the VIN number so now we have this one here and this one it's up inspect so the only thing we might need we might have to replace the front suction this one yeah remove it from the one we have over there and then we do have this piece right here same thing we have to cut this one and then just use the one from there although you could use any box we have to use all the mounting bracket for the headlight and the bumper from the cord we have so this Fender came up good we got it up in its track this one right here we got it up in his back also too the only thing is we have the carbon fiber right here is damaged and then I think we got it we have it here but I have that piece Houston and then if you could look right here you know what I mean gaps and everything is good so the real what we have we have this one here that needs it that needs to be repaired that's just a hole in the fender a quarter panel then you need basically the rear bumper I have the OEM rear bumper and front bumper OEM stuff I would probably put the OEM stuff back on it and have like a regular classic kind of chill car I might change the color from yellow to maybe something else yeah that's what I was thinking yeah maybe that makes sense now you know what it looks like so and the car runs the car runs fine yeah yeah here's the money shot right here yeah a factory jaded LP 640 and the interior I cleaned up a little bit but you know could use a proper detailer to just give the leather conditioning a little bit of love but everything's I mean it's good it's clean okay cool yeah I mean you yeah it's a million bucks sounds good to me the virtual handshake he's asking me if I'm Really Gonna sell it here's what here's how I genuinely feel if I let it go now and don't drive it again I'll probably be okay the other side of it is I just hate dealing with this stuff like when it was like not crash no accidents that was different but I have lots of other cars and I gotta talk to Houston hey buddy all right man I appreciate you thank you guys for coming just let me know your question is do I sell it do I not sell it I'm in the works of making a deal with Houston if he bought it yeah I haven't made the 100 decision I know Houston would let me drive it so I could still get my fix in and probably Drive the manual Mercy in the future that's it now I have some hard decisions to make you guys for now I think what we're gonna do is later in this video we'll probably go out at some point and do some more Shenanigans and night drives all right need my hoodie it's a little chilly out in the Cali area we've got skinny in the house let's go baby we got the type R yeah skinny mobile and we're gonna take out this street Evo we're gonna go on a crazy night drive with some dudes who are down to get into some Shenanigans so you know it's about to get wild are you doing your strike gotta get ready I used both legs when I drive I gotta get ready yep all right I'm ready you gotta get the ears massage I'm sorry gonna hear from you I'm ready come on let's hit the street you guys it's gonna be a fun night Carl looks so good send it on this green I want to see it go [Music] [Applause] oh you know it's gonna be loud nice played out car no do you like that you had this story earlier on his Instagram and he saw one of the Evo race cars and he says the race car is really sick what do you guys think of this kit I don't know man it's kind of played out and I was like dude there's only two of us that have it on A Streetcar seven of these ever made in the world like as a whole super fatal street cars it's true yeah it's true it's already been done I haven't been like playing like a hurricane with no bumper in a chassis mounted Wing oh yeah come check out the not played out Huracan the technical the brand new one you parked your plate out Huracan next to the non-play-doh damn that's cold bro you gotta do that too look at this Bringing Down the neighborhood brand new that's so cool the only thing I wish they did was I wish to change the headlights yeah I wish they made them like the race car you know at first these didn't grow on me I didn't like it but it started to grow on me like but it actually did change the headlights they're brighter and they see further designs just I used to drive without these yeah you like to spec I like these cars I think they're really cool the biggest thing I like is I love that they changed this up although my one complaint would be with the new method replacement I still don't know how to say they exposed the engine yeah oh yeah do you think they're just waiting to do that to the replacement of this car I think so because this is actually longer than every other Huracan so I think that they made space for a terrible that dude making a lot of claims hey brighter headlights it's longer I didn't tell you but it's really got 20 000 horsepower my man's got the inside scoop I do lamborghini.com two or three centimeters longer and I think they did that because they want to put a Turbocharger in there that is turbocharged I'll tell you right now he's just reading the specs off the back of the car hold on this one is the brand new it's a V10 I think the styling is really cool how they did this because it's got that like spider Vibes but it's a hard top Coupe you know what I think I think tell me what you think I'm really liking what has the same finish with the Gallardo yeah it comes in yeah I want you to put this on the air would you say this dries as good or better than a SEO okay SEO is going to be better the SEO steering wheel is stiff and that's really good for high rates of speed but if you want to say the Driving Experience I think this drives way better than SEO what do you think Josh I think our played out hurricanes are still better than that I think because we have the extreme chassis amount of wings yes from 2018 DD yeah so Throwbacks yeah the played out one yeah I got a little baby Wing over there you know dude quit freaking people up long time no see it's been a whole like four or five hours yeah let's do this so we got a whole crew and we're gonna go tear it up we did a driver's meeting the driver's meeting was everybody stay away from the back of Damon's car all right I'm excited for this it's like we got Fast and the Furious Supercar Edition tonight is going to be a good night I can feel it already it's in the air let's turn some TC off and have some fun yo it's crazy we climbed up this hill so fast we're loud let's go yeah yeah [Applause] [Music] it's so crazy it's so much fun is absolutely obnoxious and I love it oh here we go overpass so what everybody out of fuel already not filled up not yet the pops and bangs race fuel yep Damn Race Fuel at the pulp yeah 99 I got 99 problems in fuel ain't one what are you eating I had some Pringles you definitely had some and they are gone yeah sharing nothing hand me down chips open up let's have a closer look at the it's a Technica right correct Technica like check this out it's got a factory carbon fiber hood that's sick and I love how it's not like perfectly finished it's like race cars by the way my man's rocking some Louboutins you think that's crazy dude what else you got you can just go shopping today what's going on and you got a pair on oh God what I love this guy happy Jewelers Danny again is that where you went yes sir happy Jewelers does it again so I really like the styling of this car 640 horsepower so it is a horsepower increase over the original all-wheel drive 610. it's cool that they upgraded the whole like just exhaust tip design the little wing and the little wing could have been a little bigger in my opinion personally but everything else is really cool I like it wrong with the Huracan what's going on over here I hear a master debate of arguments or debating what's going on I hear a lot of debating over here I said that to AP I said it's beautiful peas exactly say what's wrong with the Hublot mine's from Happy Jewelers too but it's borrowed borrowed time it didn't borrow that's yours I'm poor oh right yes custom cars this dude driving around with a Rolex on his wrist and one in the front and a pair of Louboutins on his feet and a pair of Louboutins in the trunk I'm not rich I gotta delete you from my Vlog someone's gonna Rob your no yes don't do that oh I didn't even notice this car's got a carbon hood the thing that's cool about the R8s is that the hood and the fenders are one piece there's no seam this is one piece this all opens up together pretty dope you don't got a carbon hood and you don't got a supercharger actually has the cats are glowing yeah Flames that's sick oh [Music] I heard all sirens and everything [Music] I don't think we'll take that exit I'm just I'm just saying I might avoid that one oh here about that after whoa he flew by me with his sirens on yo what the heck bro he blew by me with his sirens on and everything bro taking him he's he's going for as many as he could yeah well we're pretty much fishing a barrel when we all take the same exit but we're smarter air pound boom there's four cop cars there now no we were all driving the cop was in the center lane and everybody flew by him everyone blew by the car okay come to Chevron I'll be right there okay damn so the report is that James our boy from South OC Cars and Coffee is going to jail we'll have to get a follow-up all right let's call James and see if he'll even answer well this is good you're not in handcuffs dude he clocked me at 133 and then another one Instagram that's amazing lucky lucky lucky lucky oh they just let them off clocked him at 133 and or 138 and 143 and they wrote them a ticket for a hundred that's a nice car you can't do that back where I live and that would be take your car and go straight to jail like 100 120 miles an hour is over 200 kilometers an hour like that's making

      "corpus": "[Music] foreign and AJ looked back at me and I was like what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] was that he's like and all of a sudden the car goes guys right now we're running three entries for every dollar you spend on 1320video.com to win this GTR and 15 000 this is a full bolt-ons GTR making it 650 all-wheel horsepower on 85. perfect amount of power for the street all this can be yours all you got to do is go to 1320video.com right now every dollar you spend is three entries to win this car 15 grand [Music] I'm koi Christmas and today I'm telling you the story about how everything went wrong everything also went right well so I got started in racing you know a couple about a decade ago easily started getting into a little more hot and heavy starting with the GTR areas where I really enjoyed it working with cisio performance and those guys out there and really the reason why we started on the GTRs was because that was my wife's car and bought it for her for her I can't remember it's 2011 we got a 2012 GTR for and I got it for her birthday and man she bought her pants on that one that was a good it's a good way to keep a wife and then from there uh like everybody else that has GTR they want it to go faster so we started doing that and we started going full bolt on and then full bolt-on wasn't enough and we had to move out from the 3.8 liter to a 4.1 liter and then it was a 4.3 liter and it was bigger turbos and more a better transmission and then pretty soon we had ourselves a race rocket if you will for my wife's car and then I was jealous because her cars were significantly faster than mine so I had to go buy a GTR and I got into the GTRs and I actually really enjoyed the full bolt-on and I had a blast with that but then I moved to I think it was I forgot what cecio called it um it was a something plus kit and so I moved into that and that was pushing about 1250 horsepower somewhere on there now my wife was pushing like 1600 at the time before she went up to like 2600 when she got this really big you know really big power but it was still it was a lot of fun to drive and I enjoyed it we started going out to the tracks we started racing doing the the drag strip ones obviously going down like the fl2ks and Texas 2ks and uh we'd go to the uh the summit Raceway which I think was in Ohio we go to a couple different places we'd race a lot down there but one place we did get to go race so we enjoyed a lot was driving down to Brainerd brainer International Raceway when I was uh was there I started noticing these Billboards and poster signs and they kind of said they said things like hey we have um Proving Grounds which was one event that they do that like twice a year and improving Grounds was a lot of fun I'm trying I can't remember the name of the the company that would put that on I know the guy's name was Dan or Dana or something like that but anyhow it was a super Super Awesome event and you do it twice a year and you got to do a bunch of different activities they had like drifting and things like that and then the other one they had in summer was called Power Crews and so we did our first Power Cruise and I think it was around 20 14 some around there and we did our first Power cruise and we were we we thought we're the only people with GTRs and that's how I met my buddy AJ because I was over there driving around and I was like wait a second so he parked and I pulled up next to him I said you should do Tiana he's like yeah I said oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] man did we just become friends and we started talking I was like are you ex-military and he's like yeah and I'm like oh my God we're like buzzing buddies now just like Step Brothers you know I'm like oh we're best friends so we we I mean it was I I should not like two weeks after that he was up at my house jumping out of an airplane I mean that's how he was like hey man I'm gonna go up there to jump on an airplane can I come set your place I'm like come on and so like a friendship was born and it's been like that ever since I mean we've been next to each other everywhere as a matter of fact we we pretty much moved together we moved out of he was living in Minnesota I was in Wisconsin about two hour and a half hours away he's in the cities I was up in the Twin ports and then he moved to Arizona and I'm like I guess it's time to move to Arizona my wife said there's you get no argument out of me so we moved to Arizona when did Texas 2K and that's when I just bought the uh Ford GT I had a yellow uh GT with black stripes it was like 1300 horsepower well Cisco performance had built it up I took the supercharger out put twin turbos on it and it you know it was just that was a that was a badass car that you you have to know how to drive that car or you will kill yourself there is no it's all driver mod in that car uh the Ford GT has no help at all and that is just so fast I got that and uh other friends of mine is like uh paren um prin and Chris they're over at Chicago motor cars and I was talking to them and I'm like dude you know I really want to I really want to check out a Lambo I want a skittles car you know that's what I call them a skittles cars because we've been driving around the GTRs we've been doing it for so long and my wife was like a thousand plus horsepower over me and I'm like I don't want to get my ass kicked by her all the time she already gets all the I mean 13 20 we sit there and cover all the time you know I was like oh look here's a woman just freaking cracked the 7-1 you know I mean it's like yeah you know not to mention her language on the track is always an amusable is amusing you know so I pretty girls tell you what man when we get back because it was at Texas 2K because when we get back this was like 20 2017 I think it was he goes when we get back I got one I'll send it to you just drive it let me know what you think he knew what he was doing so I get this white one comes in I get it and actually I didn't even drive it at first my son drove it he took it to prom and everything else it was like a 2015 you know it wasn't the perfect Monty it was the regular Huracan and uh but it's still you know it's just it sounded badass it just felt good I was like this car is the [\u00a0__\u00a0] so I said I get the car I trade in the the GTR I immediately wrapped this car this crazy color they put these badass wheels on it you know the same wheels that I've got here um and then I did a crazy powder coat and stuff and everybody called it uh Skittles the thing is what everybody was calling it was because it just looked all crazy looked like a tie-dye right took it down to the car show people were like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] this is amazing and then I was like yeah this is great and I was like but it's not quite fast enough I'm like it's it's cool it's a Lamborghini but we need some more power and we need to put a different presence on it right so I'm like all right let's pull the wrap off of this called up I mean geez this wasn't even four months later I pick up the phone and I call up and I call print up and say hey will you take this car back you know that give it now take it back because it's something wrong I'm like can I trade it in and get a different one he's like yeah and I said well I want to get one or the perfumantes you know because I'd put like a 1610 wing on spoiler on the back of that one stuff to make it look cool but it wasn't a perfect Monday I wanted the perfect Monte so he's like yeah I've got one I said great I'm not even take delivery of it send it down to underground racing and I'd met Kevin and Casey but most I talked to Kevin the most and I talked to Kevin I'm like look man would you hook me up with a a package and I think it was a state they call it the stage three uh it was a State Street was what the first one was the stage three and then um I drove around and beat the shot of it and when I finally got it and you got it done for me really quick and I was like this this is great but I want to go faster thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign the difference between driving the GTR and driving the Lamborghini in with power like that because there's similar power the difference was it felt like the GTR when it was going it would go you hit your gears and stuff and it feels like you get to Top Gun and it's like the Lamborghini felt like it's like let's keep going instead of being like like slingshot like it was like pulling you you know and you're just like oh my God it's just the coolest freaking sound you could possibly have imagine being inside those underground racing Lamborghinis so take off in that car and uh and we're doing uh we did the power Crews that year and AJ's with me and we're doing power Crews and we get beat uh well it wasn't with AJ in the car I had another guy in a car named Adam um and we got beat by this mustang and he was like one of those uh Lebanon twin turbo type setups and he was pushing like 1600 horse and he just you know he was going we were neck to neck because obviously I'm a lighter car and everything we're going on the street we're doing it straight supposed to be 100 we're doing like 215. so we're hauling down there and then all of a sudden he hit the scramble button and he's just like I'm gonna blow the car type thing you know and he's like what I was like what in the hell so I picked up the phone and I I think I was at like 1350 horsepower or something like that with ugr so I call up and I talked to Kevin I'm like man I just had a Mustang whoop my ass he's like what and I'm like yeah he's got some power in it but he whooped my ass we're gonna do about he's like koi I can't do anything more to the car you need to put a Billet Transmission in there I said it's coming back baby so we sent it back put the bullet Transmission in it and then I'm like all right we're wrapping this bad boy Invader because I'm coming back with a vengeance baby so we did and we wrapped it up and um I was like we're coming up the design of it you know I was like all right what's I really like purple purple's my favorite color so I want to call it something really cool but then I was like dude let's kind of do like kind of like a retro 80s Miami Vice type look type thing to it so then we did it and then we put Vader on the front of the hood I was like oh man dude because I I got gold chains and stuff not like crazy like that one well actually I have a gold chain now it has Vader on it I should have wore that damn thing I forgot about that so um anyhow I was like yeah so I was like dude let's put the chain cup down right on the front emblem of the Lamborghini so it looks like a pimp chain right so we called him pimp Vader and that's how this thing was basically became what it was so the next year shows up and we're like and I had this car for two let's call it two power cruises okay so next year um we show up with this bad boy and I've got all the juice in it now you know I mean it's been upgraded it's like the stage three plus plus if you will type thing I'm running ms-109 with VP inside the import I mean it's a two to one mix type setup in there I mean you're talking freaking rocket fuel I mean it obviously because the thing they couldn't put the damn fire out but we would load up I mean for us to get ready to go into Brainerd it's a full-blown event I got a big Duel not the duel I got the big 250 double car I got a double car and a single uh trailer we've got the we've got the Ford GT loaded up on there we've got the R34 load up there which is a thousand horsepower made by Cisco as well you've got uh and then you've got Vader which is this bad boy so we got those three cars there right and Vader you know is is pushing some reasonably you know pretty good power but you know I've got that underground racing gestapo claws so I'm not allowed to tell you how fast it was but I'll just say it had all of it you know what I mean so we're getting ready we're heading down we got all the stuff we got all the cars we've got our trailers we've got a you know a pull behind you know like a 43 foot camper and stuff we're staying I mean this is a show I mean when you go to when you go to Power Cruise there's a lot of people there A lot of cars you got about 800 cars I think that year was like one of the biggest years he had to air we know all the guys here from Australia uh pretty much that's gup he's the main guy that runs it and the other thing that was big about it for me was AJ was leaving he had already been he already used my truck and everything and drive down to Arizona and moved his stuff he'd already left you know earlier that year everything was like maybe May or June you know and I was like hey he's like cool I got to come back up to get some stuff you know and he's got his boy with him uh Gabe and he's like hey I gotta come back get some stuff I got to get a couple things here do this that everything else get ready for the house to sell that kind of stuff and I'm like dude do you want to come up power cruise and let's let's rip it and he's like yeah and I was like dope well I tried to do something a little bit more exciting besides this year and we've done it now for many years and it's because everybody always asks me hey coy can I get it right in your car because that's the thing everybody wants to ride in the car so this year I'm like you know what dude I'm spending all this money and everything I'm gonna charge for it right but I'm not going to charge anybody they give me whatever they want it's a donation and then all the money was going to um I'm trying to remember it was uh the crews for Cancer all the money went to the cruise for cancer which you raised like over five grand in two days because I didn't make the third day but we go um we have this this big list everybody signing up and then they gave me a donation like one person gave me a thousand bucks you know I mean they're like hey here's a thousand bucks thank you very much it's great it's going to a good cost right and we did it and I forget it was for what um a young boy that had leukemia so we do this thing called a cruise for cancer up in the Twin ports to get a little sideline uh and we do it every year and all the money comes together for that and then we give that to we choose a kid I don't but you know the group does chooses a kid and we give that to them some you know somebody that's dying from cancer or leukemia or what's a similar they're saying you know something that's going really really wrong right and it's been it's an absolute great thing for people to do well AJ's like yeah dude I'll get done with my stuff I'll come up there you know I'll come see you that sounds good and I'm like okay so that was Thursday right and Thursday you just kind of get there and set everything up you can't go do anything until Friday so Friday morning is the first day you get to go out there and do do your racing so I've already got people all lined in a minute and then you got to take your little classes your safety class right it says if you get in an accident or fire like that don't get out of your car yeah well I didn't so anyhow damn that [\u00a0__\u00a0] hit me right there um so anyhow we uh we drove around at our stuff and that night I was sitting there and I was like man I swear that like this car is not firing on all cylinders you know I mean I feel like it's it's moving but it's not it's not like just you know it's got more right I know it's got more so AJ's like well let's check the spark plugs out in the morning it must have been like freaking four o'clock in the afternoon or something like that right on Friday and I'm like I don't think I have enough of them I think I've got like eight so AJ's like calling every texting calling whatever every single autopod store auto parts store within the area because we're trying to make sure we've got the right the right spark plugs right and he finds two more so we get them and then that morning it was early I just put on my flight suit because we were wearing these flight suits it was so much fun about flight suits like the real Air Force issue flight suits for my son and my and for my wife and for myself we had these little names we might have like uh Darth Vader on it like that on the home of patch you know and my son says I forgot what his was and I think my wife actually was like eat a bag of dicks or something like that no I said no lift Alex I said no lift Alex because she does talk like that so so I'm like oh man we um we started changing out the spark plugs and I think it was the uh number 12 torque or something like that that we lost that we couldn't we were trying to get down there because it had fallen down and we're like oh crap I'm like well I don't think it's gonna mess anything up I don't know if the torque was the one that was the big problem or not but who knew so if we get all the spark plugs changed and they're already they're already sitting ready doing like their very first like runs around and it's taking a little bit longer than we anticipated because we had to move a couple stuff we'd never done it before and we got everything just dialed in just right so I'm like hey AJ you uh let's go take this thing out on the street to make sure everything's good now I had not been in a a major car accident or something and I put it this way I've been driving cars that are you know four four digit horsepower cars for like so long now that it didn't seem like anything to me you just get it you step on the gas it's like people like oh my God it's so powerful I'm like it's not that fast and once you've drove Air Force One when I won Texas 2K uh roll racing and you do 230 miles an hour down the strip in a car like that you realize this ain't [\u00a0__\u00a0] in powerwise right but it really is but you don't think about it right you feel indestructible so you know this particular car didn't even have a roll cage in it you know I didn't have any it had a fire suppression system in it we forgot to pull the switch but didn't have the roll cage or anything like that in there and because of what we're doing on this track you don't wear any helmets no safety gear no nothing it's just your seatbelt Rock alone you go and you're not supposed to you can't like cross each of those Lanes do the Apex stuff like that you stay in your lanes that's what you're supposed to do not everybody does what they're supposed to do but it is what it is right so we go out on the highway and the way this car works is that you have to warm it up for like say five to ten minutes right and then you have to drive it for 10 miles before you get it that's what Kevin told me to do and that's what I do every single time and we never we never had any problem with the cars I mean every car that I've had from underground race and never had a problem with it it just drove as it's supposed to drive if I listen to the rules you know I mean that's why you get the rules so we track it down and we go down we go up uh I forgot what that highway is we go up that Highway and we go for about 10 minutes and we do a loop around we come back and it's like you ready to get it and he's like yes hit it and we hit it and we were it was like and we looked at each other like and both our arms our [\u00a0__\u00a0] hairs were standing up and we're like oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] it's hitting on all cylinders now and I'm like yes it is he's like oh we're about to go mess someone up I get the first one I'm going with you first go buy real quick go buy the trailer real quick let me drop some stuff off real quick let's just get in line and so I go back there and one of my old employees his name is we called him Big Ben Ben Gregory he's like six foot ten he's a massive tall guy and he's like okay I'm ready for a race I'm like hey hold on man we just changed everything out we changed the spark plugs out so now we're gonna go you know give this thing a wheel so we go around and we hit it the first time and we're just like oh my God this is this is gonna be fun and everybody there knows AJ and I I mean I say like we're the most popular people on the planet but we always bring them probably the more exotic cars that are out there um and and they're obviously really fast and we get along with everybody I mean when you get done racing stuff you go grab yourself a solo cup fill up some Southern Comfort Diet Coke that's my my choice of poison and we walk around he talked to everybody you go to Camp fires and you have yourself a good time that's the whole point again it's like an engagement you know so we go out there we go to track we go around boom I forgot what turn that is I think it's like turn nine or something like that and we make the turn and these guys in this uh I forgot the guys names but they're in the white um Evo there's a couple of them in there and you know they're pushing some power too I mean not this power but they're pushes of power and they're all I mean they might have been eight nine hundred thousand horsepower somewhere around there right and so we pull up next to each other and AJ's sitting on the passenger side he's filming I'm on the left stage he's sitting there filming and we come around in this one corner there's a bridge and that's how you come into the place so you go and basically what you do is right when you get up to the bridge and everybody guns it right coming around and we get it and I hit it I'm in like second gear it's like get it it's like when you get it you don't pull the paddles like that you just step on the gas and it's gone right and you just kind of manure it and we got it and it was like second gear and then third gear and I think we're doing a little over 100 maybe about 110 or so and right then you heard whoop just like that [Music] and I looked at AJ and AJ looked back at me and I was like what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] was that he's like and also the car goes and the car starts spinning as soon as it happened I grabbed the wheel and tried to bring it back and I'm holding the wheel to the point where for two weeks my all my re my my forearms were so sore to just even grabbed like a glass and take a drink out of because I've been holding it for so hard and I'm like we're gonna hit that wall we weren't even close to the wall but I already knew in my head I'm like we're gonna hit that wall on my foot on the brake everything there's we're done right and I mean it just felt like we had so much freaking time from the point that happened so when I hit the freaking wall right and it really wasn't that fast I mean we saw the video of it which we found AJ's phone inside the car after this thing got destroyed and he's got he had he built the phone so it would work because it was on fire and everything was completely screwed and it shows it was like less than a second and a half like one point one point five seconds less than that before when that happened when we hit the wall but it felt like it was like forever so I looked at AJ and I mean you have a thousand [\u00a0__\u00a0] things going through your head I'm like he's supposed to go home tomorrow to fly back to Arizona to be with his wife in his Littles you know because he's got Littles and I'm like I'm looking at him and I'm like son of a [\u00a0__\u00a0] you know I'm mad at myself now right there's nothing I could have done what happened happened but there is a way to like mitigate risk you know let's try to figure out the best way so I I mean all this is going through my head in this short period of time and as I looked over to AJ I said brace we're going to hit the wall he's like oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] and I saw him like put his hands up like this right we have the windows down right obviously and I'm holding the wheel and I'm like all right do I let the car hit on the back end right which is the motor and everything and I'm like that's gonna be a bomb that's not a good idea because we got the racer fuel in here and everything's in there now I probably could have done a little bit better job but you know what happened happened I knew better to hit the front because I'm like if we hit the front we're going to just we're gonna die because we're going way too fast to hit that K barrier like that it's just not going to be good and I'm like it's I can't hit it on AJ's side it's not his fault I'm the responsible part of here I'm driving the car this is my this is my choice you know I made the bed I sleep in it so I'm like all right I'm gonna take it and hit the wall and I saw it sliding in and I shoo not right before I hit that wall man I got scared as shh it came in so fast and I was like and I leaned over so I wouldn't be against the wall right here or against the door I should say so I leaned over and that was it that was the last thing I can remember was I remember was like that loud sound and the next thing I know I'm like AJ you're ripping my ass you're ripping my ass AJ you're ripping my this is literally what I'm telling him I had my flight soon I had it tied around like this and he's dragging me from the car I can't see anything like nothing I can't see anything at all dragged me from the car and my pants came off so he's pulling my ass she could cross the graph across the the road and it's just ripping it to shreds like a grater right that I'm bleeding all my ass right and I didn't even know the accident even happened you know I knew the accident hit but I didn't know the severity of it right I'm like what are you doing you're ripping my ass he's like Coy the car is going to blow up we gotta go I'm like you're ripping my ass he goes like because you're heaviest [\u00a0__\u00a0] a car is going to blow up I gotta so these toys dragging me and that's just you know AJ's a retired Blackhawk pilot you know did his two tours over there you know a real good man and he's a guy that understands he doesn't run from danger he runs into Danger I didn't realize realize that I had split my head open as wide as I had and to the point where and I've seen the videos afterwards and obviously I was at the hospital and got the 30 stitches and stuff you know I I didn't realize that I'm like AJ I'm sort of talking to him like I couldn't see I could hear everything but my I was completely blind and since then I have to wear glasses now um because that obviously damaged something but I couldn't see anything and he goes and he's like cool you're bleeding really bad man I got I can't let you go I said dude can I just lay down he's like no you cannot lay down and I'm like what and I'm like What's in my hand and he's like he has his thumb in this hole in my head to keep it from bleeding because it was just born down blood and I'm like what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] you know and he's like I can't and I'm like Duke and so I can't remember somebody finally showed up and sat behind me so I can lean back because I I had no my body just felt like right you know it just was jelly only thing I thought about was oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] am I gonna die because I couldn't see so I asked AJ probably like seven eight times hey man am I gonna die no you're not gonna die quick I'll be okay am I gonna die no man you're not gonna gay he didn't know if I was or was not I was white as a [\u00a0__\u00a0] ghost and I'm already white I was really really really really really really really white and he's just holding on to me like this and I could hear everybody and now you could hear the commotion of people and stuff and the ambulance then the ambulance shows up and my neck was all jacked up and ever since that happened my back's been just jacked so um they get me in the in the in the gurney I think it's what it's called you know a little stretcher lay me down they put this big crazy brace around my neck and stuff I mean well I don't even know what happened to AJ I didn't know the car was on fire I didn't even seen the car I didn't realize that AJ had just literally changed the rest of his life because of me I mean his hands are permanently [\u00a0__\u00a0] because he had to go through the fire and I was on fire because it all came out of the gas tank and it was all up up my window and over the Flames were [\u00a0__\u00a0] 20 feet up in the air and it was the racing field I couldn't put it out and and I just remember get in there and it wasn't until they they brought the the amp the actual stretcher and banged it on to bring it in the ambulance when they did that all of a sudden I could see again and I saw the the light above and I'm like where's AJ and AJ was up in the front and they're like dude and I couldn't see him because I couldn't turn and all I could hear was man you're really burnt really bad are you okay he's like I don't know man I'm hurt a lot bad but I'm okay that's fine let's get into the hospital right and I didn't even see the severity of his hands how bad he was burnt and he looked like you know like the drum that goes around on the on on the the score with the fire on you know I mean like a pig I mean it was jacked so my wife gets in the car and you know it kind of shed a little more fun on it you know have a little spin on it and my last name is Christmas first name is obviously koi but I like having fun with it so they're like all right let's see how let's see how are you feeling buddy you're feeling okay you know and I'm like yeah yeah and they're like all right man look you got a really you really smacked your head button so we need to ask you a couple questions to make sure you're okay can you give us your name I said yes it's Henry Halloween and my wife goes [\u00a0__\u00a0] koi Christmas he's laughing I'm laughing they're like ah he's fine he's fine so we fight we've shed some light on it right we had some fun and I gotta tell you the one thing I will say is that AJ and I have made a I mean obviously we've bled together so we're bonded for life it's just how it goes I know anybody that's gone through that kind of thing it doesn't matter you can't get mad at each other I cannot talk to him for eight months and the next day I talk to him it's like we haven't even missed a date and that's not the case but you see what I'm saying we get into the hospital Jay and I like I gotta take a piss you know they're like what you should have thought about before you got in the accident I'm like what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] really you know they're like yeah we can't let you move you can't get up we gotta we're checking you guys internally so they're doing CT scans and all these different scans on us and stuff to make sure that there's nothing like moved and broken like it's ruptured or something really wrong right and uh amazingly enough I didn't have anything broken on me I I messed my body up real bad I had some burns on my back and obviously I split the hell out of my head but now I grew hair back here which is kind of cool so I'm not have a bald spot anymore so if anybody wants to know how to do it just roll a Lamborghini or skateboard it across the cave barriers what you're gonna do so I uh I remember the last time I had saw AJ in the hospital they hadn't saw my head up yet and him and I were sending videos to each other because we couldn't leave our beds and they had him in another area because he's going to get ready to put in a helicopter and flown the helicopters over to Hennepin County for the burn center because his hands and everything's all jacked and they're like the ladies are like hey could you guys you know stop doing this right now because you're cracking us up you're I mean the nurses were just [\u00a0__\u00a0] dying because they had given him some drugs so he was all I had never seen AJ like that he was just like goofy as [\u00a0__\u00a0] and we're sending videos to each other and I was like hey man like my first video I sent him I was like man I'm really sorry dude you're not gonna get to go home now you're not gonna have any sex for a little while either I'll put you in the hospital for a while I'm really sorry about that dude my bad you know he's like oh man don't worry about it he goes what's the lesson we learned today I'm like I don't know and he's like we do not drive a car for 24 hours after we change the [\u00a0__\u00a0] spark plugs and I'm like that's a good point we're not driving cars once we change spark plugs now so now I I swear to you we've done this on other cars we changed spark plugs they sit for 24 hours we do not drive we think it's a bad Omen that's our thing that's our thing right and it makes us last still even though it's a bad thing so yeah we just got done and he and he we're talking about the whole not changing the spark plugs out right and then they tell me they're like hey look your buddy's got to go to Hennepin County he's leaving and I'm like what do you mean I'm like you can't fly the helicopter because that's what he used to do in the Army was by the helicopter so I'm like you can't find a helicopter like he is they're like no no we're flying him down there I think he's gonna fight [\u00a0__\u00a0] helicopter and they're like no he's he's got to go down for the burn center he's burnt real bad and like can I see him before he leaves they said yes and so he comes on and he's on his drugs and he's all wrapped up like a mum and he's walking in like I'm okay I'm okay I am okay and he's all dancing [Laughter] oh that was [\u00a0__\u00a0] weird all right all right my name is AJ Santiago and this is how I save this life my name is AJ Santiago and this is how to survive a burning Lamborghini crash step one have a friend like me that's a good point don't get knocked out don't stay awake the whole time all right um so where do I start all right so the morning of August 3rd 2019. now up until this point in time I had actually moved from Minnesota to Phoenix and I was on my way back to Phoenix just to get pick up another vehicle and then I was going to be driving down to back to Phoenix when I got a call from Koi and he said hey power Crews is going on you can't miss power Crews we do this every [\u00a0__\u00a0] year you got you got to see you got to be here for this and I said you know what you're 100 right so I called my wife and said hey we're gonna go hang out on track for a little bit and then uh and then we'll be on our way back down to Phoenix um that morning uh now the car the Lamborghini the uh the Vader was breaking up you know it was uh making power but it wasn't running like it like it normally would um so uh so we came to the conclusion that we're gonna change the spark plugs in it you know try to fix whatever the Miss was and uh and sure that worked so uh so we changed the plugs the car was doing great running fantastic we took it out for a test hit on the street ran like a champ um uh I mean a matter of fact I mean we were joking about it because we're like dude it's it was hidden like it was on 20 cylinders like 10. it had 20. and whatever ugr said it made for power it was making [\u00a0__\u00a0] double that it was fast because it was just stupid um and it felt good you know because I was like boom problem solved did my job now let me let me get you know back to Phoenix um but of course you know we had to do that we had to do the one uh you know um I almost caught sacrificial um uh parade lap you know just to make sure it was good um so we did and of course you know uh and I think Corey was telling it earlier you know as we um got the car on track you know we kind of took it easy going around the track um and there was a white Evo uh that was like hey they know the car they know us you know they want to make good um YouTube videos you know internet gold like the rest of us so they're like hey let's let's do a run and uh and then I was in the passenger seat so I remember going they were on my right and I said hey we're just testing you know so you'd stay ahead of us you know we're not gonna We're Not Gonna Be side by side to stay ahead of us and they were like oh come on and you know and I said nah nah go ahead and I said I'll record you I'll record you guys and they're like okay so they stayed about a car ahead of us as we got to the straightaway where you accelerate you know for the short period of time and it was the short straight because had we been on the second straight the result would be way different um because the the first straight was a really wide area that they used for parking of semis and stuff like that during certain events at Brainerd so that wide area they just had you know blocked off with these Jersey barriers um so as we approached that bridge you know they got on it and they started moving out so it was like all right you know our turn you know so we can keep our separation and and you know have our little safety window that we want it and uh and that that honestly proved to be well probably number 10 things that went wrong but went right you know what I mean because had we let our egos get a hold of us and say hey yeah we'll run you stay right next to us and then we go at the same time and as you see in the footage of the car losing control we would have just taken them right into the wall with us you know and that Evo that had three passengers in it would have crashed also and there'd be five of us that are all [\u00a0__\u00a0] up right um so it was Paramount how how it went down that they stayed in front of us um and when you watch the video you know we go into the bridge we get on it they get on it they're you know doing their thing we're catching them um but when the car loses control and we start to rotate and go behind them I mean we we missed we we were pretty close to them and um yeah it would have just been a way way different animal um but the bridge that bridge shot yeah when you watch yeah you guys can you can see it you see it it's just we just missed them and that was intentional that they were a car ahead of us because we intentionally did not want to be alongside them um yeah I mean it was it was it was the way it was meant to be you know what I mean and so many things like that happened example as they continued on and we lost control right um the car turned around we were now facing the wrong direction we both knew it was all going to go wrong um time slowed down to where raindrops you know if it was raining they would never hit the ground because it was so slow I remember I in my mind I was going through so many different thoughts and it's it's the stuff that goes to your mind when you're about to die I'm guessing right you you think about so many things that are irrelevant but clearly important to you right because your brain is choosing what things to trigger and um and there were all these little things and and I just remember and I and if I didn't mention it I was filming right because the evil was next to it says hey go in front of us and I'll film you so they were out in front of us I was filming with my smartphone my iPhone when the car rotated and I knew that [\u00a0__\u00a0] was about to hit the fan I dropped my phone probably instinctually right because I I just I just held on you know grabbed onto the door and the roof and um the car rotated as we approached the wall I remember seeing the Wall come faster and faster and uh and koi said we're gonna hit the wall and and I don't remember if I even responded or not I think he said [\u00a0__\u00a0] or yeah probably one word response I mean it's just it's all happening right there and you can hear it in that video you can hear it in the video Yeah and uh and so that in-car footage we were able to save and I'll get to that later but um in that moment it was quiet it was peaceful I was thinking about a million things and for whatever reason like it wasn't scary you would think oh you're about to die it's scary right it wasn't it was peaceful and quiet because it was that calm before the storm because a second and a half later we smacked that [\u00a0__\u00a0] wall and I'll never forget the smack because it was the pro the most VI it was the most violent thing I'd ever heard like you don't I've been in a car accident before um it's not like that it is a different violent impact from over your your left shoulder like maybe maybe like if a football player tackled you and you were just brushing your teeth and you had no idea what's going to happen right like so get you out of your get you out of your seat that it scares you to death and um I stayed awake during the entire event the car hit the wall instantly it felt like a nuclear bomb went off I felt this flash of heat and it was Windows Down nice beautiful day flash of heat kind of glazed over me um I was holding on the car was inverted upside down and as it rolled back over I was trying to understand what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] you know I was just waiting for like hey just turn my lights out because I don't know what my last memory is going to be but you know I'm just waiting for that and you're done right um we hit the ground the car starts to slide and then it stops and all of the violence is over it's peaceful and quiet again except for a campfire firing in my ear and I'm like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm holding onto the door right I'm just like I'm [\u00a0__\u00a0] live dude and I remember going Coy we got to get out of course on fire I can smell the fire so I open the door I get out and uh I run around the back side of the car now the car is already engulfed in flames um I'm cognizant of where I am but I'm wearing flip-flops shorts and a t-shirt because I was not supposed to be out there I was not ready for track day this wasn't uh test and tune this was charity rides you know doing a good cause doing a good thing we've got to test the car real quick let's do a lap not a big deal right um I come around the back side of the car and the driver's side's engulfed in flames the rear wheel is missing um when I came around I was expecting to see him kind of exiting the car at the same time you know we just kind of you know make a way and go holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] except that's not what I saw when I came around the back side of the car I noticed that the door was still shut and what caught my attention was the fact that I could see him humped on the steering wheel the door handle was still in um but it was all melted and [\u00a0__\u00a0] and it was going quick I didn't know I knew what kind of fuel was in the car because we had just filled it up so my my initial thought was this thing is one and a half seconds away from blowing the [\u00a0__\u00a0] up and we're going to be you know this is going to be like a Paul Walker thing like instantly like like the size because I'm an engineer right so my brain is thinking the fire and the fuel and the electronics and everything going and like this is just a recipe to kill us both now we survived this crash but now we're both gonna die in this explosion so I go to the car and I open the door handle and uh I opened the door and Corey's in there and when I first saw him he had blood on the back of his head he was just humped on the steering wheel and I was like he's dead as [\u00a0__\u00a0] like here we go I got my dead best friend and he's in this car he's gonna burn to the ground right and I'm like well you know not on my [\u00a0__\u00a0] time and uh you know people have heard stories of of things that I've done in the past in the military and they know and I know that I don't think nobody behind ever no matter what and uh and here was it was another instance of that so um the craziest part so he's he's in the car and this is happening like so [\u00a0__\u00a0] fast you know we it slowed down for the for the impact but this is happening so fast the car is burning quickly and the fire is getting out of control very fast and I go in I unbuckle his seat belt and pull him out of the car now when I pulled him out of the car I'm five foot five you know 160 pounds he's you know 220 pounds six one he didn't weigh a [\u00a0__\u00a0] dime he was weightless when I pulled him out of the car it was incredible to me that he didn't weigh anything the roof was collapsing the roof was pushed down the wind the driver's Windows only this [\u00a0__\u00a0] tall didn't matter he came out of the car with ease and when I pulled him out of the car I got him out of the vehicle and the second I got him out of the car he instantly weighed a million [\u00a0__\u00a0] pounds and and hindsight looking back obviously you write the adrenaline is what helped me take him out of the car because if we had to do it as a dry run today or tomorrow anybody in my in our size class it's an impossible task to do if you ever carry someone that was sleeping or whatever like my child you pick them up and they're 60 pounds of sleep they weigh like their million pounds there's no way there's just no way right but here we go there's another thing that just happened to go right you know adrenaline was hitting at the right time pulled him from the car now when I got him out of the car he turned into a million pounds again um and I was wearing flip-flops you know I fell um I got back up and I was just thinking a lot of the car I got him out of car now let's get [\u00a0__\u00a0] in this car before it blows the [\u00a0__\u00a0] up um so I'm dragging him and as I'm dragging him um a couple of things happen now one part is he woke up which was awesome because up until that point he was the doodle dead weight um and I was for certain that he was dead first certain he was dead um but he wasn't and and I remember being so like oh like you're alive but we got we're now we're definitely not going to make it because now you're alive but we're gonna burn next to this car and blow up so let's go [\u00a0__\u00a0] and he's he's talking about his ass and he's like oh my my suit has come down and I'm like come on we gotta go I don't we ain't got time for that [\u00a0__\u00a0] and uh and interestingly enough um I wasn't the only one there now some people was what I don't know if you get tunnel vision in some of these moments right but I remember other people being there and I remember other people helping me and I didn't know if it was like angels and [\u00a0__\u00a0] you know like this house crazy but hear me out um I just remember people helping me but I knew that we were by ourselves but there was people helping us and um we got away from the car and I sat him up and he had a big hole in his head and I was like well okay and what you know we're checking them off here okay uh hit hit K rail burst into flames check uh survived the crash check oh he's gonna burn to death let's drag him out oh he's alive now it's always got a hole in his head so um he's got a hole in his head it's it's gushing out blood on the back of his head and I'm like okay I can do this so I stick my fingers in there and I jam it all shut and I'm holding closed and I'm talking to him and he keeps asking me am I gonna die AJ am I going to die I said no you're not gonna die I said we were gonna die a second ago in that car when we were burning and gonna blow up but we're good now we're good and what I didn't know is at the time he couldn't see anything uh and he didn't articulate that he just kept saying am I going to die because I can imagine he just woke up getting dragged out of a car with me tearing his ass on the ground um now he's blacked out and he can't see anything but he he he can feel things and he could feel pain but he can't see anything so you know is this where you go when you die so I can understand his fear but um but I just reassured him that you know everything's gonna be okay um the hard part was done I thought at least um that we're gonna be fine you know and people started coming up and asking you know oh my God you know and it's crazy people would come up with their cell phones out you know right in my face and they're like oh my God are you all right I'm like no we just had a car accident let me have your shirt give me your shirt I need your shirt I need something for to put on his head you know and people are taking their shirts off and I'm using their shirt as a rag and uh and I'm like hey let me have can I have your water and they're like yeah here you go they're using water and we're trying to make it work um and in the meantime you know it's crazy this is a racetrack if when you watch the video cars are still speeding past us hey what you I've done Motorsports long enough to know that when it was an accident red flags go out all the corner workers tell everybody to stop and you get off the track so you make way for emergency vehicles watch the video watch all the extra footage the car is flying past the whole time whole time and I'm like man like they're not nurses a car on fire you know people out there trying to make it happen whatever but um they're not going slow either no no they should they could they were there faster than the animals they could have swung by we could have thrown them in the car done a lap to the hospital before the ambulance showed up but um but that's not how it worked out it actually worked out um so many so many good things came out of it the airbags in the car did not go off we hit the wall and we were guessing somewhere between 110 and 120 miles an hour okay um backwards none of the airbags went off um and that was a blessing you know at first we thought what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] you know is there a malfunction what's going on what happened that the airbags didn't go off but had the airbags going off a couple of things could have happened right I could have been knocked unconscious by one of them there was curtain bags front bag Knee Bag bags all over the place it could have hindered me getting out of the car it could have delayed my reaction getting out it could have covered his window so when I got out and I came around and looked to see if he's still in the car I just see a curtain and I go oh he must be out somewhere he's over here but he's not he's throwing the car burning to death right um it could have it could have been that snag Hazard when I'm trying to get him out that you know we're getting caught up in these bags there but but they didn't go off you know and it's like the gift and the curse right like it should have but what uh whatever um people you know we hear people see the video and people go oh you know you guys should have been fully up kidded helmet and everything if he was wearing a helmet you know he's 6-1 in the car the roof is already right there when we flip this thing over and the roof comes in it punctured the back of his head if he was wearing a helmet and had another two inches of cushion there I probably would have compressed the spine and broke his neck was right he could be a paraplegic you know you'd be rolling around in a wheelchair um or dead you know it could have gone so differently but it went it went just as bad as it needed to be right um from there it was uh so up until this point in time I had no idea I was injured so um I'm helping him and then people are coming up and helping us and it wasn't until one of the one of the people that came up said hey are you going to be all right and I said yeah I'm all right I'm gonna be fine why like he he's got a hole in his head we're trying to fix this [\u00a0__\u00a0] and they said well what about your arms and uh and that was the first time I'm holding it sitting there holding his head that's the first time I looked down and I noticed that all of the skin on my arms was missing and uh I think they probably call it shock right because you don't know until you know and then when I saw it and I looked down I realized that all the skin on my fingers and on my arms were missing um it hurt then it hurt before then I didn't even feel it and your neck yeah and yeah yeah it burned so that explosion that came through when we impacted the wall that initial impact a huge Fireball like I said came through the cabin it came in the back window it broke the back window came in the back window and it went out my window because I was trying to figure out how I had got burned across the whole side of my head and the back of my neck my ear my eyelashes were gone from the glass or whatever yeah there was cuts um it was absolutely ridiculous but that the the footage after the fact helped us understand what happened um of course the burns on my hands and everything came from um the fire but yeah I didn't realize how bad it was um and I and I continued you know we I I was first went into the ambulance you know because they said hey let's let's get you guys taken care of and you know help showed up they put me in the ambulance they started working on me they had him on the stretcher because of his neck they were worried that his that um you know maybe he had hurt his neck or broke his neck or something like that um or there was only a white person only stretcher I don't remember it was something like that right but um it's like hey you got you you just get into trouble you can walk yourself in there um but no they were fantastic that actually the crew was fantastic and they got me in the um ambulance and I remember the poor guy uh that was helping me he was I can tell he's he's done it for a while but maybe this might have been the realest thing he's ever seen right and this is Brainerd Minnesota maybe there's not that many incidents or something but I was in pain and I was very vocal about it letting him know that was in a severe pain and inside the ambulance they have a little safe on the wall where they put the narcotics and they lock it in there so people can't get it and he was trying to get the combination to open this thing he kept messing it up and messing it up and he was wiping his eyebrows he was like he's like I'm sorry man I'm going I'm coming and he's trying and I said hey man I'm gonna be all right I'm gonna be all right it hurts take your time and he took a deep breath put the coat in perfectly opened the safe um he I think he gave me Demerol or something like that gave him something he made him stupid oh my God the second he put it in me it fell to me I was like oh this is I can do this I'm all right now I'm okay before that I was like man you're gonna help me out man but it hurts so bad um but he took care of me so Kudos I wish I knew his name I'd give him a shout out because he was fantastic he started patching me up um I was way too [\u00a0__\u00a0] up to to be patched up but he was doing what he could do you know because in Burns I guess infection is the number one thing you're you're exposed your raw skin and they want to make sure you don't get anything in there and I got his blood in there a bunch of raw dirt a bunch of VP 109 and all mixed in there um so uh so they got us enough they got us in the ambulance and they got us to the hospital um once we got to the hospital um you know they said hey you know a couple of things were going on they needed to notify our significant others um or for me at least because I was there I was there with my son only which he got ended up getting left at the racetrack but he figured it out um but to create one of my craziest pieces is and I've told this story before they uh I was wearing a wedding band made out of tungsten now all you car guys out there I get it you guys know right tungsten is the [\u00a0__\u00a0] I got it because I work on so much [\u00a0__\u00a0] my rings would get scratched up and my wife be like oh my God your ring looks also messed up so I got a Tungsten one right because it doesn't scratch it's the hardest that's fantastic until your hands are been burnt to crisp and my fingers are starting to swell up and the lady came in and said hey I need to cut off your wedding band or you're going to lose your finger and they had me doped up on all this stuff so I laughed at her and I was like ha ha good luck cutting this off because this is what they make the tool to cut it off out of you know so she was like oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] so she went got a doctor they came back they're talking and uh while they were trying to figure out how to figure out if they're if I was gonna lose my finger or not I just pulled the ring off with all the skin attached and uh and she turned around and I said I got it and she was like oh and she grabbed a little specimen cup and I dropped the ring in the specimen cup and uh and so so now I wear I wear a little silicone one so you know Pro tip if you're going to be a car guy wear a rubber ring rubber rings and go to the bathroom before you go and go to the bathroom before you go racing in an accident um but uh so so my interviews were I guess pretty severe I got third degree burns uh on a lot of portions of my body um dragging this [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of the car so they said I had to get on a helicopter and fly into the city we were about an hour and a half north of uh of the Twin Cities so I need to get to the burn center um that was a yeah that was an exciting trip uh from there it was you know stitching up his head patching up my Burns and then flying you out huh and flying you out and flying me out yeah flying me back home um and you were so goofy I was I was kind of goofy apparently you're so high but I mean you know all in all you know we we learned a lot of different things from this um you know we learned number one uh if you're gonna change the spark plugs you know wait 24 hours before you drive the car um I think you cover that one right oh yeah um and that's just our little rule is kind of funny but uh but live by example right it's so crazy you know something like this to survive something like this and I'll be 100 honest you know like yes it sucks that the car is damaged yes it sucks that these different things got you know kind of [\u00a0__\u00a0] up my trip back to Phoenix but you know it broke stuff inside of me for a long time um you know like this is the tough part you know [Music] when I came home you know um I was not very honest with my family um you know hero syndrome or whatever they want to call it you know you you know everything's fine you know I'm good I'm the hero of the day whatever you want to call it um inside I was an absolute wreck um yeah you just didn't want to address it yep he didn't want to you know it wasn't until that damn thing rolled back in here I try not to think about it at all you know I haven't seen this vehicle since I pulled him out of it three years ago yeah okay um I haven't seen the car I never saw the car after the incident when I pulled him from his seat I turned my back to it that was the last time I ever seen it what's it like for you to experience having a carpet hopefully I mean it brings up a lot of bad emotions but at the same time it's I guess I kind of look at things a little differently now you know since all the things that happened I don't look at it as just a negative thing of like oh look at the car oh my God almost died in it I also looking to go man you know I mean there's a lot of life that's come from it I mean I look at life differently now I act differently and I mean I've been through a lot of stuff with eight heart surgeries and things like that going through that I I I've always approached life optimistically but I mean this brought AJ and I closer than we ever could be I mean we'll I mean we're going to be old old men when we die and still know each other you know I mean that that's uh that like really ships never go away and I think about how my family acts you know because that scared the hell out of my family just like his family I mean scared the pants out of them and you know you you saw my son a little bit ago and and you saw how he is I mean everybody saw it and I feel like it's a it's a blessing I know it's a it was a bad thing that happened and it's tearful and it hurts you know what I mean and I wish it didn't happen it was also extremely expensive but you know now so you want to throw a dollar figure on there but it was very expensive the part that about it though is that I look at it and now because of that my son who races my wife who races other people that we know who race they go oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] that can happen to koi that can happen to me yeah and so it's an eye-opener to him and it's like dude I got to make sure I check all my stuff properly let me make sure you know my son walks a track now you know he walks the track and goes around and says okay oh man you know this corner right here it's got a lot of dirt on everything else I'm going to take this corn a little slower so I don't zip off of it or something like that or have an accident or maybe there's some oil or something people pay attention a little bit more and I feel like it helped out quite a bit and I know it helped the show Power Crews quite a bit because they made some adjustments because they're like dude that was the worst crash that they ever had and they've had bad crashes like I said just people got but nothing like where they had ambulances carting people off and stuff and helicopters flying him home you ever find him to the Hennepin so I I don't it's a bad thing I'm gonna tell you the hood is going to come off and it's going to go on my wall you know what I mean it's going to be a reminder to me you know just like the Pacemakers reminded me I'm still kicking that's reminding me it's still kicking you know I mean I'll probably have AJ sign it so I can have something famous from them you know what I mean but I mean otherwise I mean it's it's it's it's a car right it's what came out of the car to me that's more important I I don't know I think I think we're very blessed and uh and I think you know it must have been what it was supposed to happen because the things we're doing now in our lives our attitudes I think are extremely positive and our kids are I think they hold us a little tighter and our wife's a little tighter because we're a little happier I'm quite Christmas and that's a story and that's how my best friend saved my life [Music] this is so ridiculous"

      "corpus": "- Welcome to Smosh. I'm Ian, and these days everyone wants to become moderately famous online, why? I don't know. I'm not a fricking therapist. I'm just some moderately famous guy online. However, I challenged my friends to see if we could get TikTok famous in just 10 days. Can we? I don't know, \"Let's Do This.\" - [Courtney] \"Let's Do This.\" - Damien. - Hello. - [Ian] Shayne. - Hey. - [Ian] Courtney. - Agh! So this is a special, \"Let's Do This\" episode because I challenged all of you and myself to try to get a million followers on TikTok with an anonymous account in just 10 days. So the rules were that you couldn't show your face, you couldn't have any clues as to who you were. And you couldn't promote the TikTok from your own profile, and be like, oh my God, who is this random guy that's so funny. - Right, easy, child's play. - No. - How did, how do y'all feel? - I feel great, I actually feel really good. And I will say it's been a blast doing this. - Oh, Courtney, there's something behind your ear. - What is it? - Oh, it's some bullshit, but here's a star wipe. - All right, everybody. (dramatic music chord) I lied. Just kidding, just kidding. - No! But for real, I actually downloaded TikTok for the first time in several months just for this challenge, 'cause I was taking a little breaky break. But before that, I would say I was probably like the longest standing try-hard at social media at Smosh. I went hard on the Gram. Would You agree? - Yeah. - Sure. - You want us to kind of- - Yeah, yeah, you're very good at social media. - 'Cause like, Shayne will post once a month, but his performs the best. Shayne's actually the only person in this room who actually has a million followers, plus, on TikTok. - Damn, you're just gonna call me out like that. - Do you have a million? - No. - He might on this new profile. - So it was really interesting starting from scratch and having like a really clear game plan. So I have some methods. People are simps for animals. - True, true. - It's huge. - I do get a lot of animal videos. - Yeah, people get invested on TikTok. They want part twos, part threes, even, and interaction. So with these three methods in mind, let me introduce you to Tolerant Tug. - [Shayne] Oh, that's so unfair. - Using your animals, that's so unfair. - It's strategy, I didn't show my face. I followed all the rules. - [Participant] Yeah. - There was no rules against using a cat. So this is Tug, he, him, his. He is very tolerant. - Okay. - Okay, I like that. - And so my challenge was seeing how tolerant my cat is. - Great. - Day one, day two, day three, getting people invested in seeing where this journey is gonna go. - Tolerant of others, tolerant of like, concepts you're introducing them to like, tolerant. - Tolerant of all races. No, I'm just kidding. (group laughing) Testing my cat's overall tolerance of how I act around him. - Got it, okay. - Yeah, do you like his little profile pic? - [Damien] Yes. - [Ian] Yes. - Really, that's a really good profile pic. - It's mid. - So this is how I kicked it off. \u266a Nobody's gonna get that \u266a \u266a How is a bot no matter how good \u266a - I don't understand, I don't understand. - So that's a cat. - What's there not to get? - Yeah, I think, I think I would've wanted to show you these, I started out with different TikTocs, but these were just, testing out the photo set trend that's happening on TikTok right now. Day One of seeing how tolerant my cat is. (upbeat music) - Day two is just like, - Yeah, yeah, no, I, yeah, I felt bad. That one was just like trying to get a feel of like all the stuff. Day Three of cat tolerance test. - Oh petting the wrong way, oh my god. - It's a pretty tolerant cat. - This cat is super tolerant. - Yeah, and as you can see with day one, day two, day three, if you see these, you're like, \"Huh, I wonder how this is gonna progress,\" or \"I wonder what it's up other days have happened.\" So they go to my profile, look at the other ones and even follow, 'cause they wanna see where it progresses. Day Four of testing my cat's tolerance. - Okay, give him the old tail whip, all right. - Pokemon moves, huh? - Pretty tolerant. (group laughing) - He's like, what's that? - Pretty tolerant if you ask me. - [Participant] Pretty tolerant. - Yeah. - And does this hurt he carpet? (group laughing) - Yeah, I wouldn't have gone into this method if I hadn't known that he would be game. You'll see, it progresses even more. Day five of testing my cat's tolerance. This one did really well. (group laughing) - The timing is good, the timing works. - Yes, I did a couple of those where there was like a really long buildup and those performed extremely well. Oh, and as you can see, it did really well. - Whoa, 89 likes. - 89 likes. - Seven favorites though. - Yeah you can see saving mine, it was crazy. - [Participant] They want to come back, wow. - Day six of testing my cat's tolerance. (group laughing) - Let's see that one again, why don't we? - Scared me for a minute. - Courtney, how can you do that? - Yeah, this one actually performed the worst. - What? - What? - Oh, and see, yeah, as you can see. - [Participant] Oh wow. - [Participant] Wow. - Not good. - See, that one was so funny too. - It's how it is on TikTok. If you put more effort into some things it actually does worse. - That is true. - Got a (beep) post. I feel like you do this just like, on the daily without TikTok. - [Courtney] Oh yeah. - You just, you just sit there and just film your cat and go- - I will take Bones and spin him on the floor and slide him away and he will come running back because any touch is good touch to him, he loves it. Yeah, let's go do this is day nine. Day nine of cat tolerance test. (participant laughing) Just went for it. I didn't think he'd like this. - Tug is just like, I didn't think I'd like that either, wow. (group laughing) - What I decided to do was go through TikTok and every time an animal video came up, I decided to comment. I tolerate this, because hoping, sometimes people go in the comments and look for interesting comments. - [Participant] Yeah. - And it proved to work. - That's really smart. Also I like that cat way better. - Yeah, so, so yeah. That way you go through my activity and a lot of people would like them, creator of one of the TikToks replied to it, which is really big, gets more eyes on it. - [Participant] It's huge. These are the kind of comments I got. This is actually all of them. (Ian laughing) - [Damien] That's every comment? - Yeah, so this was the comment I got on the one where I was hold grabbing him by the neck it said, \"If a cat is being held by the neck, \"they just don't respond because being held \"by the neck is seen as an easy kill.\" - Oh, that's the chosen? - Yeah, can you read it in Chosen? - \"If a cat is being held by the neck, \"they just don't respond because being held \"by the neck is seen as an easy kill.\" - Yeah, and then of course, \"Please do not the cat.\" - Please do not, please do not the cat. - Please do not the cat. - A lot of people would like and save and watch. No one really commented. - Got a lot of lurkers. - Sounds like bot behavior to me. (Ian laughing) - So in my 10 days, these are my analytics. - [Participant] Okay. - 6,154 views. - That's great. (group applauding) - 101 Profile views. - [Participant] Okay. - [Courtney] 935 likes. - Woo. - That's pretty good. - And nine comments. - Amazing. - Yeah. So definitely an ego check, for sure. (Ian laughing) - Yeah, it sounds like it's your cat's fault, actually. - Yeah, my cat really didn't put it on for the camera very much. - No, I think if Bones dropped five pounds, I think he has a chance in Hollywood. - But he already has. (Shayne laughing) - So I was very excited for this challenge and I had a very clear vision of what I wanted to do. What I did was I took direct inspiration from my own For You page and my favorite accounts on TikTok and I tried to harness it and transform into someone who could go viral very quickly. I'll be right back. - [Courtney] Oh wow. - You just hear phooo. (audience laughing) - Jesus Christ. (Ian laughing) (group exclaiming) - No. - Is that Shayne from \"The Goldbergs?\" - [Courtney] Who is this? - This is Dale. Dale is a man in his mid sixties, maybe seventies, lives somewhere in the Midwest to South. And he's very lost, but Dale is a man on a quest. There's a whole backstory I've given to him. - Yeah. - He was married to a woman for a long time. Her name was Leanne, but she passed 20 years ago. And he has either a grandson or a grand nephew named Kevin, who will often just hand him a phone and be like, here grandpa play solitaire on this. But he just has TikTok up, and so Dale is always very confused. - Oh no. - So for the most part, Kevin is the one telling him what to say and do. - Oh, my god. - Got it, yeah. - I've definitely seen these kinds of TikToks. - Dale is a sweet man. He's just confused and has no idea what's going on. So this is Dale 169475632. As you can see, his bio says, \"Alexa, Google solitaire.\" He's just trying to find it and he can't. - And it's an even closer face than Tug's. - Yeah, oh, he's very up close. - Yeah, I like that you hid 69 in there, I gotta say nice to that. - Oh, I didn't even realize I did that. - [Damien] That's pretty funny, dude. - [Ian] He didn't know he did that. (audience laughing) I wanna be clear that whenever I was on the Dale account, I was in the mind of Dale. I was not, this was not me, this was Dale. This is a man who doesn't know what's going on. So we can see the first post. - [Dale] TikTok, I'm on, I'm on TikTok now. Saying, TikTok, saying TikTok. - Oh my God, why does it look like you're hanging upside down off of the wall? - I like to think that he sits outside and his son came up and just like, \"Hey grandpa, \"talk about how you're on TikTok, \"just tell people to add you.\" And he's like, \"Alright.\" - And you secretly film this all at work? - I was filming this all the time, yeah. - I would just go and sneak off and as Dale, I would do it, it was very therapeutic. - Oh, oh, okay. - And I started to have a lot of fun with how much could I (beep) up a TikTok. - 20 Years ago, my wife Leanne passed away. \u266a So we're dead \u266a \u266a You're the only one it takes to know \u266a (group laughing) - Oh my god. - It's like a jump scare, so like a jump scare. - And then you just keep talking. - Dale, I wish the audience could hear that. - I know. - Oh, bad. - So, so yeah, that's the, you can go to Dale's account and watch these with the original audio. So, but I thought, I can keep (beep) this up more and more. I need to be less capable on TikTok. So he would stitch things like his grandson would stitch it and he wouldn't realize what he's even stitching. (upbeat music) - I'm having trouble when I urinate. (Courtney laughing) - Kevin, I wanna play solitaire. (group laughing) - Oh, my God, not your mustache turning into a lady! (audience laughing) - That was so funny. - Do you want to show it again? - Yes, please. - Kevin, I want, I wanna play solitaire. (audience laughing) - You know, I like to think that this is Kevin's For You page and Kevin's a 18-year-old, 19-year-old boy, so it is very thirsty TikToks and so scrolling, specifically trying to stitch and like those, to save them to stitch, my For You page for Dale became a nightmare. (audience laughing) I thought I knew how horny TikTok could get, I was wrong. - You have no idea. - Oh. - TikTok can get so horny, unbelievably so. - How did you first get those ones to start stitching? What did you say into your phone? - I didn't say anything. When you first start on TikTok, it shows you all sorts of (beep). And then you just, the second something horny came up, I was like, gotta like that. And then it's just was like, TikTok was like, oh, alright, we're gonna keep making it hornier for you. - But that was for the character, right? That was, that was for the character. Yes, yes, I needed to get it to this place. Yeah, you need, yeah. For the character. - That's Kevin's mind. - You are the Daniel Day Lewis of horny content. - I am the Daniel Day Lewis of TikTok. - [Video Voice] How many tape layers can support- - My ex-wife could suck a golf ball through a garden hose. And I miss her dearly. - Oh, my God. - Yep, confused, just confused. Oh I need to emphasize, I would put as little thought as possible into these TikToks. - No. - There was not much planning involved. - Good. - Yeah, so anyways, moving on. - Arggh! (group laughing) - What the hell. - Yeah, Kevin hands him the phone, tells him to yell, he yells. He doesn't know what's going on. - [Courtney] Oh my God. - That one also I think did pretty well. - Kevin's stealing his social security checks. - Oh for sure. - There's no way that's not happening. - There's a dark underbelly to this story. - Yeah, out of sheer curiosity, do you speak for the trees? - What? - You look like a Lorax dog. - That mustache does give a Lorax vibe. - I've never, I've never watched that, I don't- - It's a book. (audience laughing) - Here's a good one, here's a fun one. - Okay. Uh! - Alright. (group laughing) - I wanna point out, I have gotten served TikToks that are just like that where it's like, it's an old person, they don't know that the filter's on and they're just there and they're just confused. - Oh my God. - Kevin definitely had a lot of fun handing him that one. - Yeah, oh definitely. - [Shayne] Yeah. - That's a tolerant cat, right there. - How tolerant is Dale? - All right. - Very happy with this one. \u266a Make that pistol pop \u266a (group laughing) - No! - Doesn't know what's happening. - Oh my God. - Does not understand. This is the last one. (upbeat music) - Whoa. - Why did you do that? (group laughing) - Why did you do that? - I think that was a little bit of me coming through, 'cause I was a little like, why did you do that. - Oh, have you not been getting food content like that? - Oh, I've gotten, I've gotten that. So Dale got a lot of comments. - Oh. - He's starting to get some fans. \"Thanks Dale,\" \"Dale doing the damn thing,\" \"Dale, you are not good at this.\" - [Damien] Exactly. - Someone said, \"Relatable.\" Someone on one of 'em said, \"Why ain't dis viral?\" - Uh-huh. - Now what was shocking was, a couple people figured out it was me. So I got a couple being like, \"I wanna know \"what your opinion on Shayne Topp is, Dale,\" someone else said, \"Shayne, I don't know \"if I like this Dale guy.\" Pretty wild. - Whoa. - Mmm. - Pretty impressed that people figured that out 'cause I tried my best to hide the identity, but the analytics were pretty good. I got oh 9,436 views, 675 likes. - [Ian] Oh, okay. - 58 comments. - Damn. - Wow. - Oh. - So that means a lot of those were filtered. So you probably had a lot of people saying some (beep beep). And 275 profile views. (participant applauding) So overall pretty happy. - Okay. - And like we've been doing this for the past 10 days as of filming this, by the time this airs, I hope to get Dale to go like super viral. I'm gonna keep posting as Dale and as of watching this right now, the Dale account is still active and I'm gonna be doing this all the time 'cause it's a lot of fun. And I love getting into the mind of a Boomer who's confused on TikTok. - Alright. - Go follow Dale. - [Courtney] Go Dale. - Go find Dale. (group applauding) - Remember the numbers. - [Ian] Yeah. - One, six, nine- - You might wanna change that. - Who do you think would win? You Shayne, or nine (beep) Grizzly bears. Now that I've got your mind out of your comfort zone, let's talk about my TikToks. I decided to use a method that I've seen employed more and more on my For You page, which is duets that have nothing to do with the actual content that is being shown. They are leeching off of these content creators, and then just showing like either a Minecraft speed run beside it with like, a \"Rick and Morty\" clip. Or maybe there's like, a cooking thing going on while \"Family Guy\" stuff is playing. I don't know. So duets are extremely popular and a good way to go. So what I came up with was something very, very special that also hid my face. I came up with the Duet Therapy Wolf. That's right, in 45 minutes two weeks ago, I went into the scariest darkest room in the Smosh offices, wearing a fake ripped person shirt, a spooky rave wolf mask, werewolf claws, and danced to a lot of otherwise popular TikToks. - Ah. - Yes, it is smart, thank you Courtney. (audience laughing) So Duet Therapy Wolf. Now the question is, how did Duet Therapy Wolf do? Let's see, maybe video number one. - The pace at which they move on to someone else is directly related to how uncomfortable they are with themselves. And again, should be a sign that you are right. - Wow. - So a lot of people feel self-doubt about things like self-worth, relationships. Now they could watch and support this creator, which I generally would support. Or they could watch this cool little wolf to help lighten the mood a little bit. - [Participant] Mmm. - [Participant] Yeah. - Right? - It's a little murdery like, the- - I'm actually, I'm glad you brought that up because that is part of it. You're not sure where this is. Is the person filming stuck in here with Therapy Wolf? Or is Therapy Wolf stuck having to do this for them? Either way, it's a dungeon. Now you'll see all my tactic changes over time. Can we please see video number two? - This is my impression of those guys who steal viral tweets and use them as text-over TikToks that pander towards women and always have over a million views. (sexy music) - See that TikTok did very well. Not my version, hers. - Wow. - Why are you so far away? (audience laughing) - I really want you to have to think about what's happening. - Are you just kind of free styling or are these dances that you have memorized? - It's a little bit of both. Mostly I'm just sort of, well, again, same with you Shayne, we're both classically trained actors. When I'm Duet Therapy Wolf, I'm in the mind of Duet Therapy Wolf. So I'm really just dancing how it goes. - My God, you're so tall, you look like a giraffe. - That's why you dead built like a baked bean. - A baked, a baked bean? - See that one, I really danced to that sound. - And, I see you've also deviated from the therapy aspect of things. - [Courtney] Um-hmm. - Thank you Ian, yes. In fact, therapy is probably the lowest category of things that I ended up posting. That's the twist. How's everybody feeling? We need water, we're good? (group laughing) Oh, here we go, you like Halo, right? - Inside your head, now. (futuristic music) - See, Ian thought that was funny. Ian thought that was real funny. So do you see the stark contrast? - [Participant] Howling bears, that's rough. The prints just stopped seeing. - What is printed and what is not. It's just this fleshy little, little flesh stretch. (audience laughing) - Well, now the facade is cracked. - It sucks, 'cause now they know that you're not just like them for real. - [Ian] Yeah. - Well 'cause that's the thing. Shayne, yes, we're all wearing clothes, but you know what we all wear? A mask. - I wear a handlebar, like a- - Handlebar mustache. - A walrus mustache. - I can make a Tok with no handlebar. - [Participant] No handlebar? - No handlebar. - No, nobody knows that song anymore. (audience laughing) - I'm 32 years old. (audience laughing) Okay, so this one's just like me, for real. I forgot who this is. - Just knowing the version of him that I knew, clearly died. - Oh. - What, was that a sentence? - She's got a lot of comments and a lot of- - [Courtney] Yeah. - Views from that. - How about you? - You'll see, later. - Okay. (group laughing) - And I think, let's see some comments to see how people responded. (group laughing) We got some, ah, now one of these things is not like the other, \"What the is (beep) is this? Delete your account,\" \"Delete this (beep) bro this mad cringe,\" \"We can see that you are just wearing a shirt,\" as you all pointed out. \"Never post again,\" \"Why is this cringe on my For You page?\" I will say, \"Thank you for sharing cool dance too.\" I'm not gonna say that I changed a life today because I think that she already did. - It's strange that Chris has the same last name as Dale. (group razzing Damien) - You know what? - Yeah. - Nice, we dueted that fist pump, do you see? So we both have a million followers, so- - [Courtney] Okay. - 444, angel numbers. We have 313 likes, 14 comments, most of them pretty mean. (audience laughing) And then 92 profile views. - [Participant] Yeah! - And that's like, I mean that's 92 lives completely changed, realistically. - Whew. - Yeah. - So I think the main takeaway is thanks to the Duet Therapy Wolf, you know you're never alone, because your video could be next. - Wow. Like whatever you're going through, we're dancing through life together. - That's great. - Alright. (group applauding) - [Participant] Wow. - Oh, and ah, thank you Aaron for doing the lion's share of what this challenge was supposed to be. I may have danced for 40 minutes, but you did this assignment for a week and a half, (audience laughing) So thank you. - [Participant] You! - [Courtney] Hey, hi. - Hey Ian, hi. - [Courtney] Ian! - I guess I should preface this. I've never used TikTok before. (audience laughing) I one time downloaded it like, four or five years ago. It was like, I saw one video and it was just like, people just doing a dance. And I was like, nah. And I deleted it and I never downloaded it again. Let's just say I went into this not really knowing how TikTok works, but I do know a few things about TikTok. I think I have an idea of, of what hits. And it's all about finding a niche. It's just finding like, a micro niche and you just stay in that niche. - You mean niche. - Or niche, some people say niche, some people say niche. - I'd probably say niche. - You know, there's a niche of people that say niche. And there's a niche of people that say niche. (audience laughing) - I don't like the second niche. - It's pretty awful. - Niche sounds like- - It feels bad. - And I am a son of a niche. - Yeah, okay. - I'd like to introduce you all to the next big influencer. I rate hedgehogs. - [Courtney] Wow. - Oh, I'm glad the underscore is there 'cause I thought they were just gonna be pissed off hedgehogs. - Right AI, that was animated- - [Participant] I rate hedgehog. - I had did make up something - [Courtney] Wow, the underscores. - Basically, I mean, you're gonna guess what this is. I'm gonna be rating hedgehog TikToks. I don't think I've ever been served at a hedgehog TikTok. That's a niche. - [Participant] Okay. - You know? - True, true. - So let's just see the first one. - Alright, so we're taking a look at this hedgehog right here. He's got a little splash going on. Good range of arm motion. I give this hedgehog like an eight outta 10. Yeah, give that, give that hog some good pets. That's a good hog, that's a good hog right there. - Oh my God. - Gumm ba-da-ling - Gumm bling. - Solid. (audience laughing) - Okay, so you are a guy that wears a I love hogs shirts. - Yep, so I heart hogs. - In cutoff shorts? - Yeah just some like short-shorts. - Sitting on a piano keyboard stool. - Yep. (audience laughing) - Yep, I went so far as to film this in my friend's house, so there was no association with with me. - And your friend witnessed this? - No, they were in another room. - They were asleep. - No, they weren't, they weren't, they weren't there. - [Courtney] They weren't awake. - And also why is the focal point your, ah (beep)? (audience laughing) - Well he hearts it. - I love hog, and it's just like, right in the middle of camera. - [Participant] I mean like, alright, - Look, i know what people like and it's focal point (beep). (audience laughing) - You should have bought those fake balls that they put on the back of trucks. (group laughing) - Truck nuts? - You want some truck nuts? - Truck nuts and then you should have sat on 'em to make it look like they're coming outta your shorts. - Shayne- - You would've so many views. - Yeah, you would've done better at this. - That's what I like, so what? - Okay, let's see that one. - It's just closer on his crotch. - Alright, so this is a stitch that I've done. - Okay. - Oh, a stitch. - [Announcer] What would you rate this hedgehog? - Whoa. - Well that's a real fancy hog right there. I'll give that hog about a nine out of 10. That's a good hog, it's a fancy hog, and I like that hog. Let's go. (group laughing) - Boom-ba-leem! - It's just a more, like a more rugged Link Neal, I feel like going on. - [Courtney] Oh! - And you may notice there I show a little bit less leg. I did, I did move in a little bit more. - You did, I appreciate it. - The focal point becomes like this hog and not this one, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. - I was definitely looking at your chin the whole time. - Alright, so we're taking a look at the whole gaggle of hogs right here. You know, I can't give a rating for just one of 'em, so I guess I'll just give one point for every hog here. So it's like an eight out 10. I don't know if there's actually eight there. I can't really count right now, I'm drunk as hell. Eight outta 10, good hogs. So I'm adding a little backstory now. My character is an alcoholic. - Okay. - Wow, I love, you're kind of like, sitting like an Instagram batty in that one. You're like, and like the the shirts- - Popping it out, yeah. - Shirt there, really wrinkled in. - The S is never visible, It's just I love hog. - Well, it's kind of an awkward position because I have to like show all the words, but then I have to have my face out of the shot. But I'm also, I'm also dueting, so I have to be watching the screen. So I'm sitting there like this- - Oh, I can see that. - [Participant] You're definitely doing a sleigh here. - Singing along to Ga-Ga. - And I don't think I've ever worn a tank top in a video. So nobody, nobody knows- - You definitely have. - Nobody's seen a tank top Ian's shoulder, so- - I can name the video. - No, you can't. (lively music) You could stop. - There's nine hedgehogs. - Nine. - There's nine, so what is the actual term for a group of hedgehogs, is it- - [Participant] It's a prickle. - [Group] A prickle? - Of hedgehogs, wow. - A prickle, that's so sweet. - So I wanted to delve into the horror genre here. - The whore? - The horror genre. - I genuinely, I'm sorry. - Brace yourselves for this one. - [Video Voice] Oh my God. (hoofs pounding) - Wow, alright, well that that calls it. Okay, oh, I gotta rate this hedgehog, nine out of 10. You're freaky hog, gosh dang, I need to change my name. Hey, I'm gonna tell you what. - Why do you look so snatched? It's very funny. Like it felt like this time you kind of clipped the tank top in the back and you were seated even further. - The tank top should get shorter. - And the undercarriage. - The tank top should be more and more cropped every single one, just to the neckline. - [Courtney] You know what I mean? - [Participant] You really found your angle. - Yeah, tonight I decided to, hell man, that's not even real hedgehog. Zero out of 10. - My guy does not, does not let anything get by. - [Courtney] Wow. - Like he's, he takes this very seriously. He doesn't mess around. - I just love that, like, if this was the first TikTok I saw of this person, I would have no idea what they're doing or why there's this is video happening. - Yeah, that's true, that's a good point. - Well my name- - [Shayne] He's very confused. - Well my name is I rate Hedgehogs. - [Courtney] Yes, woo! - That's some numbers right there. - [Participant] The most popular. - This one wasn't my most popular. - Wow. - As you can see, it got eight likes. And one person saved it. The one with no real hedgehogs in it was the one that- - I Rate Hedgehogs has been a sensation, guys. - Okay. - It blew onto the scene, and you guys aren't gonna believe this, but here are some of the comments that I received. (audience laughing) - I got zero comments. (audience laughing) - [Courtney] What? - Yes, not last. - Is that worse than hate comments? - Yeah, that's funny. - It's certainly quieter. - [Courtney] Yeah. - Let's take a look at my stats, so- - [Group] Whoa. - So I got 441 video views, 11 likes, whoa, that's almost as many videos that I made. 52 profile views, which actually seems kind of high, and zero comments. - Oh wow, well done, an attempt was made. - At least I did it all by myself. - Ooh. - Wasn't that a (beep) mistake? Look at the stats. - That's honestly true. Now we're gonna see everybody's analytics together. - Yes! - And figure out who is the most successful influencer here. Let's see who got first place. And it's Courtney! - [Courtney] Whoa, really? - Yes! - Whoa! - Well done, 25 followers! A little bit shy of a million. - Yeah. - And 910 likes. - Wow. So that's great well done. - [Participant] Okay guys, we have a surprise. I have to announce it. - There's a surprise? - Come out here. (dramatic music) Hi, I'm Patrick, I direct this and there was somebody else in the race. - What? - And while you guys were competing, there's somebody that entered the race late and they were competing in a shadow account to see if they could do better. And we're gonna reveal that right now. So whoever created this account, please step forward. - I knew it, I knew it. - Erin! - I was sabotaged. - [Courtney] Wow. - You could have just posted. I'm Erin, separate from Art Erin. I am the associate producer here for Smosh Main. - Oh, from work? - Yeah, and that was cute. You guys did so good, I'm so proud of you. (audience laughing) It was really good. So I was tasked with tracking your progress. I was also offered, if you wanted to use my services, which Damien, you did, I posted all of yours. - Thank you, Erin. - Ian, I helped you download the app. I taught you how to use it. - Damn. - I've never been, I've never used it. - Do you qualify for the AARP because, goddamn. - We have our very own Dale here with us. - So I realized pretty immediately that these millennials had no idea what does well on TikTok. So I decided to make my own account. I didn't tell anyone, I kind of just made it and like was just gonna see what happened. And also I had half the time to do it. So I only did this in five days. Also I am Gen Z and you may not know this, but we're sick. We're sick in the head, we're just a bunch of sickos. - [Group] Um-hmm. - Okay, so this was my strategy. I took a popular fandom, our lord and savior, Harry Styles. I mixed it with a niche demographic, feet. - Feet. - Feet are a niche demographic. - And I used a format demographic that TikTok loves, which is fan cams via CapCut. - [Courtney] CapCut, yeah. - [Participant] Yeah. - I present to you HarryFeetCam. - How is that allowed? - There was some issues with it, but I got around it. Sometimes I didn't, sometimes I got some emails and it was like, that's not okay. - Emails? - Emails from Harry Styles. - So this was the first video I posted. (rhythmic music) - That alone will have done better than all of us. That got 10,000 view. - Yeah, so if we go to the next slide, in its first 24 hours, it got 13.5 (beep) thousand likes, views, it got 2,000 likes, 140 saves, 160 comments. Yes, that was the first 24 hours of this going up. (lively music) - Oh see, I like that one. (audience laughing) - Do you wanna share with your thoughts? (Damien laughing) - I mean you really went for it, yeah, yeah. I get it, I get why people would be into this. Just so you know, I was a huge Chris Pratt fan and then I met him and had to slow dance with him after he saw all of my weird tweets about him. I'm sorry, is it Chris Pratt? - Is it Chris Pratt? (bell dings) - [Announcer] Yes it's Chris Pratt. (Audience cheering) - So just so you know, now that you work at Smosh, anything is possible. - We could get Harry. - And Harry Styles might see this video. - Oh, he will see this video. I did think of that, I did think of that. - Okay. - We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. (electronic music) (group laughing) - This one did really good. - Ah yeah, I would, I get that. - That one did really good. (classical piano music) - They're like musical notes. (electronic music) - Right. So that one I posted a few days ago and it is my best performing- - [Participant] Oh, my God. - TikTok, so it got 13.1 thousand views. - That looks exactly the same as the- - That was like, same as the one that I posted first. - Okay. - Wow. - [Erin] Comments. - \"Menswikifeet beautiful work is always,\" no! - Someone- - You're building a fan base, no! - Thank you. - You inspired someone, so did I. - Oh, thank you, yeah. - Wow. - [Ian] \"This is my favorite video of all time.\" - Yeah, I know, that's huge. - Actually they came back and they wrote another comment. - That's two comments from the same person. - They're a really big fan. - You secured a very good handle. - That is true. - HarryFeetCam. - I was surprised it wasn't taken. - Yeah. - I'm surprised it's not either, yeah. - That's huge. - So this, I learned to code for this. I made this filter. (rhythmic music) - That's why you have the Shrek helmet on your desk. - Yeah, I couldn't show my identity, so I used that. And I learned to code, so I let Rachel know. So we will have a Smosh filter coming out on TikTok by the time this airs. If you go to the Smosh TikTok, you can see which Smosh cast member you are, so- - Whoa. - Dale, are you gonna use that? - Sure. - Dale! - Dale will use it. - Okay, so I had a marketing plan. - [Participant] Okay. - First I made my entire feed just Harry Styles fan edits, so that I could like and comment on them. I only commented Baby, Daddy, and then I would join livestream and I would just comment, promoting my page. Just any that I could, you know? - Yeah. - Yeah, a grassroots campaign, yeah. (audience laughing) - Really Bernie Sanders- - Can you imagine that guy getting so stoked that there's a viewer on his livestream, and then it's like, \"Hey, check out my Harry Styles feet pics.\" - Yeah. - It's awesome, you didn't have to be so (beep) mean about it. (group laughing) - That's so cool. - But I'm very proud of you, you did a lot of great (beep). - Do we have the full stats? - [Courtney] Yes, wow. - [Participant] Oh my God. - So I have 41,000 views, 438 profile views, 6,000 likes, only 700 comments. - Oh, is that all? - Awe. - Well compared. Yeah, that was HarryFeetCam. (group applauding) - That's great. - [Participant] That's really great. - Oops, sorry. - You good Shayne? - No, get this merch at smosh.com. - Get the merch at smush.com. - Get the merch at smush.com. - Are you just devastated you got owned by a Gen Z-er. - I just, it's smart. It's smart. - Yeah. - Well, I just, keep in mind, Shayne, that if Erin were not a part of this competition, Courtney still rocked you. - So I think like, for this one, it's pretty clear. I don't need to choose anybody to choose the winner. It's very clear, the winner is Erin. (group applauding) (dramatic music) - You did a great job. - So that's it for the videos Put the other video on the screen right now, go and watch that one and bye! - Bye. - Bye. (lively music)"

called Fool's Paradise it opens in theaters May 12th say hello to Charlie Day [Applause] oh man you got a good crowd tonight I was very impressed that you guys you and your sunny Pals went over to London and Ireland you had like sold out shows there we did in a foreign you know those are foreign countries yeah in other parts of the world and I was wondering what like I mean if somebody told you like almost 20 years ago whatever it was when you're making your writing it's always sunny and trying to get on the air that 20 years later you'd be doing a podcast and so many people in other countries would come just to see you talk about this show that that would be a surprise yeah I'd be like well you're dead wrong you know no one's no we're not going to fill a stadium of people just to hear us have a conversation but uh we did and we'll do it again yeah anyway the venue you're at was the Royal Albert Hall which is like the Beatles played there yeah I mean it's a very you know a lot of history and I have a about this place so you know how there was this mystery like maybe Paul is dead people are like oh Paul's dad is not the real Paul McCartney well when you go in the bathroom of Royal Albert Hall I think he's dead and he's in there uh the smell of that place really yeah I mean I mean it was beautiful you walk in you're like oh my God this is amazing then you walk into the dress room you're like this is the smell of ghosts it's an old smell yeah you don't think about that although I think the Beatles when I think they wrote a song about how many like holes there were in the in the Royal Albert Hall many years ago and that was you know that was quite some time ago it's one of the songs about how many holes there are in there yeah yeah there it is yeah which one is that that's um what is it Ken Day in the Life yeah all right everybody I don't listen I don't listen closely to lyrics You Dig those holes would some of the smell would go out of them but I guess not should we write a song about it so you did this big thing by the way I saw your buddy Rob mcelhenney yesterday oh yeah yesterday on Saturday him and his new best friend Ryan Reynolds how does that what's going on there is that cause you any um I don't know jealousy any bad feelings a little bit yeah he's trying to trade up on me you know I mean he comes up with this idea to buy this soccer team or football team as they call it now he calls it yeah he calls it football yeah he's learning to speak Welsh also you know this no yeah yeah he's trying I mean that's all fine and I'm proud of him but it's the fact that he's got the super handsome movie star best friend who just keeps being like you know what I I made another billion dollars today I saw yeah I saw sold a phone company you know we gotta remember this guy to stop right that's what you need you need one of these guys like that I need a guy who would be your guy that you could buy like a team with or something I'm talking to you DiCaprio are you here let's start hanging out man let's start hanging out let's buy uh let's buy the Mets or something that's not for sale they were just purchased but you can go actually shoot a little bit lower you know what would be good though is Hugh Jackman because he and Ryan I'd like to see you steal one of Ryan's friends from him okay yeah exactly you know Ryan did think too where he he had this like high production Birthday song yes they do birthday videos for each other did I put in like a hundred thousand dollars in your birthday gift just teaching people how to pronounce it's like a bad movie from the 1980s you know what I mean where the where the sports jock steals your friend yeah you're like Dempsey betrayed his friends he would play poker with to and then they oh they hit on his house that's what they're doing to you these guys man I'm angry for you yeah well they did tell me a story about you being over there watching one of these games and um well tell would you mind telling me the story as you saw it because I thought it was kind of interesting well we did a lot of great things over there one of my favorite things we did uh we talk we talk about me trying to run with the athletes which I think is where you're headed no it's not but please tell me we went to a Distillery a famous Irish Distillery uh and we get we met by a man who's like The Godfather of making whiskey and we get off this bus and he's about 107 years old you know he's got like three whisper hair and he's like he's like uh gonna show us on a tour we're like oh boy we got to get to the show you know he's like are you boys ready we're like uh sure Here Comes let's go and he starts firing all over the you know down to the machine he's like taste this taste this you know he gets up he turns the spinning on he's like try that one he's going this guy's going all over the place and I'm I'm thinking of myself man if I can bottle up with this guy has when I'm his age that'd be amazing we get on the bus we look up how old he is he's 71 years old he looks like [Applause] drinking the machinery and get your hand just don't drink straight from the machines then you go to this game then we go to a wreck some game and I didn't know this I assume you were stunned to learn this but they are not you're not allowed to drink while you watch the game yeah they're drinking yeah yeah so they do have like a Ryan Reynolds Rob mcelhaney private box where they look down upon their not supposed to drink in that either get out I got details on this yes what you did was a violation you probably won't be invited back to Europe yeah you know they're not gonna let me back in Wales but they told me that somebody that caught you on camera drinking a beer yeah and your solution when you realize they said hey you're not allowed to do this you just drank the whole thing on camera yeah yeah yeah well and yeah no more beer so now it's gone yeah now it's gone now it's about three deep um which was fine you know I was like that's reasonable it was kind of I was like this is going to be good for me you know that I'm not allowed to drink here because I'm gonna pay what about getting on the field why did you get on the field okay so this was a big mistake um so uh it's a great game they win the game very happy for Rob and Ryan and uh and uh we go down to the field and they're like do you want to do the cooldown with the boys and you know Grant Glenn and Robert are like I'm like uh yeah I do uh and I'm like what it what is it I'm like well you just Sprint with the boys I'm like sure so uh I line up with these guys who are young enough to be my children and um we go we take off running as fast as we can now until about halfway through the field I'm keeping up I'm like hey these guys are that that and then I realize that one of them's running with me the way you run with your child you know like when you're holding his hand he's like come on there Johnny then they see that they're supposed to keep running so they just keep going then we get to the end of this field I'm like oh that was the field by the way is much bigger than like the the field my 11 year old plays on right yeah and then you get to the end of the field I'm like well that's done I'm like well now we're going back I'm like why not I might not make it all the way back but uh I gave it a go and I've still I've just caught my breath like 15 minutes ago okay yeah yeah all right we'll give you another breather we're gonna take a commercial break Charlie day is here whether it's a new movie that's called food Paradise got some chairs no no we're good we're good hey I just wanna tell you that I dig what you're doing really I just think like words are overrated you know there's such crutches for us as actors can I get you guys some chairs no we're standing you know Spielberg said that you should be able to watch a movie with the sound off if it's hey guys got those chairs for you get them out of here there's Adrian Brody Fool's Paradise which is a movie you wrote you directed you started and you gave yourself almost no lines in the whole movie and tell everybody what the idea behind the movie is all right well so you we start with Ken Jong who by the way gives I think the best performance of his career not just because I wrote and directed him in it but he really he really goes out of his way it's like emotional but it's hilarious and so we start with Ken and he's this Sad Sack down on his luck publicist guy who just wants to be in Hollywood and he's being fired by his one and only client and uh he happens to meet a man in a mental health facility uh who doesn't speak who's me I look just like a method actor who refuses to come out of his trailer so the two of us Collide and we go on a rise and fall through Hollywood and then I think comedy happens and the rest of Life wrangled quite a cast here let's go through some of these names here uh besides Adrian Jason Sudeikis Kate Beckinsale John Malkovich the late Ray Liotta is in this uh you shot this win uh shot it uh over the course of a long time I did my first pass of it in 2018 and then right before I went to go sell it in 2019 I changed my mind and I shot a whole new chunk of it in 2021 because I I decided to I'd like to take my time yeah well why not why if you can't take your time it's my movie I'll put it out when I'm ready Jason Bateman has a uh a part in the film how did you get Jason to uh be in the movie so I was very lucky with you know getting people I hadn't worked with uh like Ken and Kate and people I knew a little bit like Malkovich but Bateman I obviously know from Horrible Bosses and uh I went to drop my son off at school one morning and uh I ran into him and he said oh how's your movie going I said oh great I got I got sadakis coming to set tomorrow he's like man I wish I could come play with you guys I said well come I said what do you mean I'm like I will stay up all night writing a roll for you come to work and he goes really and he came down and of course because he's a comedic assassin he's like the funniest thing in the movie uh and I could have caught him out of it but why would I do that and it doesn't bother you when he says things like I'd love to come play with you guys see that as a yeah now okay all right warm and open up you have a Hollywood weirdo man that sounds great to me always sunny comes out uh next month this is a uh your friend Rob who I probably have mentioned too many times for your liking posted this on uh Twitter this is uh quiet is this an episode or what's going on here you got you got Aaron Paul and yeah Brian Cranston that's an episode of Television pal so uh uh we're we're making fun of uh celebrities who sell a booze uh and uh and we said they said you know can we be on your show we said we're gonna take the piss out of you and they said aren't you uh selling a booze yourself we say I'm gonna take the piss out of ourselves too that's what we do yeah uh and they're great on the show I can't wait for people to see that episode so they are not playing Walter White and Jesse Pinkman here no they're they're not the gang they're playing themselves but I but we're convinced that it's uh uh the dad from Malcolm in the Middle and Malcolm Fool's Paradise opens in the theaters May 12th Charlie day everybody oh [Applause]"

online who's younger than me it makes me want to curb stomp this monstrosity so no one ever has to look at it again okay now think of a joke not one you've already heard before I want you to think up a brand new never been done before joke ah okay you know how cats are like lazy maybe we could do a joke about a lazy cat and his owner is like ah stop being so lazy that sucked too now imagine doing both of those things together and then putting that artwork up for the entire world to leave their unfiltered Anonymous opinions and on top of that you also make virtually no money off of it who in their right mind would put themselves through that kind of torture well dear viewer I would like you all to meet Zachary Zachary is a web comic artist he makes webcomics just so when you're scrolling through your timeline while taking your morning poo you get a little chuckle to yourself and then you keep on scrolling forgetting about his existence entirely in mere seconds I have a soft spot for funny web comics not the Super serious superhero ones or the Japanese ones wait why is this part all pixely webcomics can be shared on any platform in fact a lot of webcomics get reposted without the artist's consent and with their names removed which is which I know weird that someone went through the effort of removing a watermark when they could have just you know not done anything and left it I hope you all realize that behind every comic is an artist who just wanted to make you laugh and doodle something that day I started reading webcomics at a very young age back then we just called them Comics they were really the only books that I like to read and the only place you could read the hottest new Comics was in the newspaper oh sorry I should clarify a newspaper is a stack of gray paper that would be delivered to your house by a child riding a bike and they would print 19 pages of useless information and have one page dedicated to the funnies this is where the classics were born you know the ones the Calvin and Hobbes the garfields the the far sides some of these Comics have made me laugh harder than any meme ever has I just want to say that Calvin and Hobbes was an extremely creative comic it was a comic about a rambunctious boy that had a giant predatory animal best friend I mean where else have you seen that before by the way if you ever see those Calvin peeing bumper stickers those are unlicensed knockoffs and really go against everything Calvin and his creator Bill Watterson stood for in fact all Calvin and Hobbes merchandise is unlicensed because Bill Watterson never made merchandise but I mean aren't these crochet hob Styles the coolest so there was only enough space in the paper for about 20 comics and last time I counted there were way more than 20 comic creators so if you wanted to get your silly little comic in the news paper you had some Fierce competition but now anyone with a computer and enough dedication can create Comics that gets shared by millions of people you don't even need a fancy drawing tablet or expensive painting software or even art skills in general webcomics and the internet and memes have been intertwined for decades many of your favorite meme formats are just edited web comics now in most cases if someone took an artist's work defaced it and then re-uploaded it without credit that'd be a bad thing but memes are different I guess the reason I'm bringing this up is because I want you all to know that these artists have made other Comics that are just as funny and you should support their work and buy their books and if you're going to make a webcomic at it please just keep in the watermark it's literally more work to take it out and you're being an some of You original gangsters may remember that I also used to be a webcomic artist I posted my first webcomic in 2012 which was over 10 years 10 years it's been that long what the I'll be honest my webcomics took a little while to get some traction let me explain something all the comics I would read in the newspaper had distinguished characters with personalities a lot of times the punchline of a newspaper comic would only be funny because we knew the characters in their mannerisms Garfield hates Mondays so instead of him hating Friday the 13th he hates Monday the 13th that's a good one Garfield so I try to make a webcomic like that with my own little Universe I'm Gonna Be A little vulnerable for a minute let's talk about my OCS I made when I was a 16 year old boy there were three main Brothers Jake who was a self-insert character one time I dressed up as him for Halloween Justin the book smart straight man straight man as in the character archetype not the sexuality although if any of the brothers were gay Justin would be the gay one and Kevin the laid-back older brother who did whatever he wanted because he's the oldest those three were the main boys Jake Justin and Kevin the three whitest names anyone's ever heard now if you're an up-and-coming comedy webcomic artist I would suggest to not to do what I did if you're just trying to make someone laugh you don't need a whole cast of characters that have intricate relationships just tell your joke and leave or don't it's your art you can do whatever you want eventually I wanted to Rebrand myself instead of having distinguished defined characters I went with the very basic looking character design that had absolutely no distinguishing features at all and I settled on a design that looked like this I mean over time I refined it I originally posted my Comics exclusively to Tumblr it was just me and this other obscure web comic about trolls we were the two main ones really now if you're still an up-and-coming webcomic artist then you should post your Comics to every platform imaginable I learned the importance of cross-platform promotion the not so easy way one day I got a Tumblr message from someone asking if they could post my Comics to a small Unknown app called iFunny and I said sure then that guy would periodically send me messages like dude we are blowing up our Comics keep getting featured and I was like an hour then I wake up to messages asking hey are you the one posting these to iFunny and I said no but I gave the other guy permission to you know he's impersonating you and starting beef with other artists right hmm it turned out that iFunny was my most popular social media account and I didn't even have access to it I eventually got the account back and now people tell me that they loved reading my comics on iFunny back in the day which wasn't even part of the plan originally webcomics have really impacted me and this channel some of my earliest online friends were other webcomic artists who I don't keep in touch with as much as I should my bad guys I'm sorry my username is based off my webcomic my character design was made for my webcomic and even my Cannonball profile picture is from a panel in my webcomic I really hope this video makes you appreciate the web comics that you see on your timeline I know you see them they're everywhere if you come across a comic you like I want you to try and find the original artist socials and browse their other Comics they've created I guarantee you'll find some Banger Comics that just didn't get the same amount of attention as the other ones and who knows you might just make a difference someone's art career you know making a whole video about webcomics has made me miss my first love a lot of times when I think of a joke I have to wait two months to tell it and at that point I don't even know if it's funny anymore but a web comic can have Same Day joke delivery so this is how I'm officially announcing that I'm making webcomics again I'll be posting them on my website and maybe Twitter if I'm still verified there's already six brand new Comics feel free to make any meme edits of them I I don't care also be sure to check out this amazing reversible toasty plush it's honestly my favorite thing and up until April 10th we're running merch Madness where you can possibly score a free VidCon ticket and meet up with me you don't even need to buy anything to enter so check out the description for more information I'm super excited to be making Comics again it's how I started out my internet Journey I'm gonna try and post at least one comic a week so be on the lookout for those um thank you all for watching and sticking through this end card y'all are the real ones"

water so I'm going to twitchcon to review my experience it's taking place down in San Diego the plan was to just drive down this way but uh oh there's a car crash looks like I have to go all the way around and then camp out in this sick desert so I get to San Diego that way to you know to review twitchconz Michael why do you own a salvage title run down piece of [\u00a0__\u00a0] pickup truck from the city of Los Angeles um because it's Swag first of all five times cheaper than a normal truck and the most important I make too much trash at my house I put it in this truck and then put on a high Vis vest and drive around the place where I live until I find places with dumpsters and dump the trash and people just assume that I work for the County of Los Angeles and No One's Gonna bother you you have a high Vis jacket and the white truck with the light on top so [\u00a0__\u00a0] where are we going to twitchcon we're going to uh we're going to twitchcon piss number one well this is a fun quirky story conflict I came back from pissing and the truck was doing some pissing of its own I think it's leaking coolant not really a car person but I want to say that the coolant thing should have coolant inside of it some water in there just to give me two and mechanic store water is cold sometimes so that's pretty much coolant yep up hmm [Music] luckily it didn't matter because the engine was so hot that in the five minutes it took me to drive to the store it already burned away all the water so you know Small Miracles back to driving to the desert and it was actually a really nice drive it was blue skies good day made the perfect place for the truck to overheat on the side of the road that's not good I'm sure that's bad I'm sure that's a bad thing okay no no listen to this mmm good so good this coolant pipe was leaking everywhere how do we fix that I don't know cool yeah so I just took it off so I just took it off and put it back on and hoped it'll work I might need a funnel yeah that's pretty good ah [\u00a0__\u00a0] we're driving for a while and then we'll open it back up and see foreign going to the desert but now you're probably wondering why are you really going to the desert and honestly I had to get to twitchcon I don't need an ulterior motive to do any of this anyways my ulterior motive is because of nystat no not that nice that his brother van neistat he has a YouTube channel and his videos are pretty [\u00a0__\u00a0] weird but they're also really good and he has this one video called should I get a motorcycle and I thought hey I should get a motorcycle and now I have a motorcycle and I thought it would be really fun to ride around this desert and that's it it's just for fun not everything has to be a [\u00a0__\u00a0] life lesson anyway we're here yes this is when I came all this way for God yes bathroom I need a map I meant like a one I could hold that's pretty easy right now I am here and I am trying to get to here [\u00a0__\u00a0] God well let's turn right onto the road that it wants me to go on to and it's a pretty epic truck but I don't think it can do sand or can they ah no I would definitely get stuck okay I can't park here so I'm gonna go up this road and find a place to park this is the closest thing that set it out of Road and this doesn't look like a road it really doesn't look like what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is that what is that it's just rocks that's not rope and so I spent the next hour looking around the desert for a campsite it kind of feels like I'm playing Borderlands but nothing's funny hey dude listen up don't die in the desert I think this is good it's a campground I don't see a single other person at this point I just wanted to ride around anywhere because half the day was gone so I took the bike down using these wooden steps that I made because I have minion legs and then I was ready to go [Music] I'm [\u00a0__\u00a0] stupid now I know I look professional but this is actually my first time going into the desert believe it or not so it's a learning experience for us all more more just me mostly me because I was there and here's something I learned science is really hard ah I also learned that I was lost realistically so I got on the dirt trail and I had eventually I pressed on didn't figure out where I was just got tired of looking in the map I knew it was the right direction after a while because the terrain started looking like this oh my God it's all [\u00a0__\u00a0] rocks oh my God it's all [\u00a0__\u00a0] sad but with no other choice I just kept going and doing desert things like climbing rocks and screaming you know desert things speaking of desert things [Music] I was gonna say I'm a sand Whisperer oh what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] no if you look like I have no idea what I'm doing and that's because I don't I [\u00a0__\u00a0] suck at this the sun is way harder to ride in than I thought it would be but hey it's fun I think oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] that's what I get that's what I get [\u00a0__\u00a0] the bikes on my leg oh God I'm gonna have to cut it off I think I can get out of this I'm gonna turn around hey oh I was feeling pretty silly after that crash so I stopped here to eat and take in The View all right [\u00a0__\u00a0] this and then immediately turn around because I'm an hour and a half away from my campsite and the sun was getting pretty low and then for my next trick I got the bike stuck it's actually so stuck that it stands up on its own so [Music] okay this is sand yeah a few hundred years from now huh it's gonna be sad well I was trying to get it out I noticed this on my phone it's a emergency dust storm alert for the area you know pullover visibility zero don't die on all that that sucks it's said to pull over but I'm not on a road so I'm pretty sure it doesn't apply to me anyways I got the bike on stuck and I was on my way oh baby yeah you know it wasn't the longest Adventure ever but I had a lot of fun I gotta see some cool stuff and it's about time that I headed back so that I could go to twitchcon why always when I celebrate oh oh no oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh no this is the dust storm oh my [\u00a0__\u00a0] god [\u00a0__\u00a0] okay I'm gonna get the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of here [\u00a0__\u00a0] this who could have seen this coming no one no one could have seen this coming but there's another problem this area is called a wash it's where water flows out of the hills when it rains the water Cuts these paths in the ground and they go all over the place it doesn't look that confusing from up here this is a Google Earth picture that I cropped to hide the watermark but when you're on the ground and it's dark and there's [\u00a0__\u00a0] sand in the air it's way harder to see where you're going so at some point I went the wrong way I don't know where but I went the wrong way and the trail started looking less and less and less like a trail worse I discovered that sand isn't really sand but tasty little rocks that you can breathe and eat yummy woman in my Widow tummy they taste so good what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] but it was getting pretty hard to breathe I'm gonna put a [\u00a0__\u00a0] dust mask on by dust mask I mean a shirt so I had to stop and wrap a t-shirt around my face so I wouldn't breathe any more yummy rocks okay get the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of here this way I think and yeah I think I found it that looks like the trail but not for long that doesn't look anything like the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Trail oh there it is but I feel like this scary music's gonna come back I couldn't find the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Trail okay this one I was on just ended I didn't even turn around this time just kept going towards where I thought the road was which is definitely not what you're supposed to do in this situation I'm not sure what you are supposed to do but it's definitely not this and I had no idea where I was I was just riding around hoping to find something which makes this next part really boring so I'm gonna put some Minecraft parkour video on the screen to keep your attention look at that a Subway Surfers oh and I'll go to Reddit and read the top post of today am I the [\u00a0__\u00a0] for kicking my dog in the head and then I'll post it on Tick Tock and then I'll post that on YouTube sorts and then I'll post that short talk on my Instagram oh wow is that the road God and I felt pretty relieved what happened is I saw these power lines way off in the distance and those are usually near civilization so I just went towards them until I found the road and then I was free [Music] foreign I think for dinner tonight I will make scrambled eggs and spam look at how good this looks it's like fried rice [Music] good night [Music] good morning I had a nightmare that someone was walking around my tent at night so I'm probably gonna have to deduct points from twitchcon for that but other than that it was pretty good and uh let's all get packed up and we'll head to twitchcon [Music] not much happened on the 100 mile drive from the desert to San Diego I had a lot of time to think about how fun it had been so far and how I wished I could have stayed a little bit longer but as I rolled into town I was overcome with optimism you see I lost track of why I came down to San Diego in the first place and so I was excited to finally get started on my review of twitchcon 4 out of ten it's all right [Music] thank you [Music] foreign"

      "corpus": "- [Sam] From West Hollywood, California, the only news team that doesn't know what's on the teleprompter before they read it. Anyone who laughs or breaks, loses points. This is Breaking News. (upbeat music plays) - Hello, and welcome to Breaking News. The show where we don't know what we're about to say, and we aren't allowed to smile or laugh. I'm Tina Pooter. - I'm Handsome Anthony. - Our top story tonight, Ford has announced a new top of the line, all electric pickup truck. It's the lowest price EV yet. What's the catch? To get it, you have to kiss the salesman on the lips. - That's right. It's a new model of F-150 the most popular truck in America. In a statement, Ford said the F in F-150 stands for frenching. - [Lily] In a press release CEO Jim Farley said Henry Ford made cars available to the masses. And today we're doing the same thing, but instead of cars, it's our soft, moist lips, gently finding yours. - The blue oval boys say that the truck will get over 300 miles on a single charge and be able to tow 10,000 pounds. You want it, don't you. You want it bad. Well, pucker up buttercup. - This all reminds me of my first kiss. It was after high school because I did not date in high school. I don't know if it's going to be funny. I think we simply kissed, but the first time I had sex, I did lock my dad in the basement to do it. (Erika laughs) Your turn! - Ah, okay. I'll tell you what. I wouldn't mind getting my hands on one of those bad boys. - Oh yeah. Let's see what you got. Make out with this mannequin's head. - Just so we're going to get a good look. - Close your eyes and think of your fiance. - Just think about the GIFs they'll make. - Yeah. That'll really help. I'm going to think about my wonderful fiance. - And how un-loyal you're being. (dramatic music plays) (kissing sounds) - Oh, that's not how you kiss! - You have no idea how I kiss. (laughs loudly) - That's true! - Okay, here we go. It's good. We're good. Let's do it. Mwa, mwa, mwa. So attractive. It helps that you're so completely still. (everyone laughs) I feel, I feel, I feel winded and sad all at the same time. - That's what I like after a kiss. No, no, that's all wrong. Be romantic about it. Tell them what you like best about them. (Erika snorts) - What I like most about you is I think, I think my favorite thing about you is your completely solid hairline. And I would say to you the other thing, that's really nice... - Tell them about the life you're going to make for them. - [Brennan] I would, I it's incredible that they have made the mannequin seem bored. The mannequin seems uninterested. (Erika giggles) I'm gonna take care of you. You're never going to have to worry. You're my princess. (Erika laughs) I'm gonna, I'm gonna build a life for you. You're too beautiful to work. - Now softly, slowly, kiss them like you're in love. - You are to me, my life before you was a blur. I only came to life when you came into my life, yup we're done. - Hey, listen. I just made up all that stuff about Ford. - I fall for this every time. Now for an update on the astronauts stranded on the space station. Here's NASA correspondent, Punky Jewster. - On behalf of Reddit and Tumblr. Thanks. (Brennan laughs) As you know, six astronauts have been stranded aboard the space station for days now. they're running out of air and hope has been rapidly fading, but this afternoon one intrepid janitor came up with a daring rescue plan. That's just crazy enough to work. - That's great news, Punky. What are they doing? - Well, it's a little complicated, but luckily I have this convenient box of knickknacks that will help me explain using a metaphor. Now let's say this coffee cup is Earth. And that this pencil is the space station. And these cards are the Earth's atmosphere. (cards shuffle) Its very thick. Thanks to the regulations that we have had to rebuild the ozone layer back in the nineties. There's actually a lot of evidence that, that, that concerted effort and changing the culture of environmentalism works folks. So the space station is here, the earth, the Earth's atmosphere is down here. If this space station goes down, it is going to burn up on entry. - Punky, I'd like to go back to the deck of cards for a moment. Can you elaborate further on the science behind that? - Oh, well, well, as I said, this is the ozone layer and the atmosphere of earth, but it is too tough. As you can see for these poor astronauts up here to get down into the Earth where their loved ones are. So what this janitor has come up with is, is to weaponize the space station, using these rubber bands that we will call the space lasers to, to sort of like shoot, shoot the, from the space station on to... - Scary stuff. - Yeah. Ta-da! Home Free! (cup falls) (Lily gasps) - Godspeed to those brave men and women who have slipped the surly bonds of earth to punch the face of God. - Thank you, Punky! We go now to the test kitchen with chef Titty. Chef, what are you cooking up for us today? - Handsome. The weather is getting warmer. And so instead of cooking, I'll be doing some, not cooking with that most classic raw dish, oysters. There we go. Oh, wonderful. Now, as you can see these oysters haven't been opened, that's how you know they're fresh. It takes some specialized training to crack them. And luckily that's training I have. - Oh perfect. In that case, we won't move on until you've opened all of those oysters. - I've got my protective gloves on because the shucking knife can be quite sharp and I, let's give it a go. Let's see. Yes, it's much harder than it looks. - But you of course have the training to know how to do it. - Of course I have the training. Now, look, I'm demonstrating the wrong way to do this. Now look, you can just pry that under there, give it a good twist and out comes a shard of shell. That's going to be bad. That's going to be something you don't want to eat. Now we are going to get that in there. We're going to give it another go. Let's see if we can get that open and look at that. Just as easy as that. - And what you're going to want to do of course is as an expert is to do it so that you don't spill the juice. - Oh for sure. Definitely not spill the juice everywhere, but you see you get these lovely shards of shell mixed into the raw meat. Give you a nice textural crunch, crunch crunch When you're slurping down them oysters. And that's one down. You do the math. You can tell this is going to take me a pretty long fuckin time. - You know, Jonathan Swift said \"He was a bold man who first ate an oyster.\" And I know there are different kinds. What are the different types of oysters? - Well, there's, there's, Kumamoto, there's Kushi. There's blue points. There are, there's of course, Pacific oysters and Atlantic oysters, and you're going to get different levels of salinity and, and meatiness depending on what kind of oyster you're eating now. - How's that second oyster going? - It's, you know what it's coming off, but could you believe I'm getting a lot of oyster juice on my hands? It's quite warm outside. I bet I'm going to be taking this smell home with me for a long time, but that's oyster number two. So we're moving on to number three. - Can you catch any diseases from eating them? - Oh, many - Excellent - Many oysters, for sure. - Well, we'll just wait until you're done. - Well, I am done. That is it. That is the third oyster all shucked. And it's just that easy folks. You can do that at home. - Mm, ah. Sea splooge. - That's it for us on Breaking News. But before we go, we'll announce that tonight's loser is Erika! And as a punishment They have to drink the garnish for the oysters as a shot. - Whew! Down the hatch. - No fear (Erika spits) - Oh!

love because it's just so I'm just gonna stare at the window with little long bead we're just gonna look at the scenic views and pretend that everything's gonna be okay right now so this breakfast place that we're going to it's 30 minutes away and me and the lambean were like we're fine with that because we like looking at the views right but fluffy is literally driving so fast she's not even looking at the sceneries and I'm like [\u00a0__\u00a0] you gotta slow down and just enjoy the ride because that's what life is about enjoying the views and it's the journey and right now these mountains are looking so crazy like you don't see this every day fluffy the speed limit is 25 and I can literally feel it's going like 74 miles an hour just to get this like waffle I know you really like waffles and I know you're probably gonna eat like 10 of them but it can wait fluff just like just slow down enjoy the views and just enjoy life because it's it's gonna be worth it fluff I like you got it you gotta look at the views it's all about the views [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] now at the breakfast place it's called The Pancake House but the llamas are insisting they want waffles so it's kind of ironic waffles at a pancake place but yeah guys it's kind of like raining outside so the weather's kind of lit but you guys know we never give up I put the llamas in this bag because I'm going to gently carry them inside because I don't want to get wet I don't know if it's really gonna work because it has holes in it but we're gonna we're gonna try so the place is

[Music] so me and the llamas we just got done with breakfast I asked fluff Bean what do you want to do and fluff is like insisting that we do something crazy right because we always want to do something crazy and then lima bean was like oh my goodness like let me Google something right now so I'm being Googled one of the craziest things to do in Hawaii and that was to climb this mountain so now we're at one of the most dangerous mountains here in Hawaii just check it out look so we're gonna hike to the top of that one we have to be really careful because we cannot fall off the cliff and if we do we're gonna have to call toast and toast is gonna have to fly all the way across the oceans to come and save us because we're in the specific ocean now fluff bait can you please tell us what your thoughts on are on this cliff she's really scared but we never give up and we always try new things llama Bean says she really hopes that we find lettuce up there well let me there's a lot of greeneries out here check out all the greens maybe you'll find something you really like who knows llama Bean you never know what we're gonna find in life so what we're gonna do is the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna pay for parking because we haven't paid for that yet we do not want to get towed the last thing we want to do is get stuck here in the jungle right fluff right so we're gonna go buy the parking and we're gonna go hike on this Trail and hopefully we survive so before we go on this hike we have to be super prepared guys llamas can you tell me what exactly do we need oh lima bean Mama Bean makes a great point should you said that we need lots of grains because if we lose our energies if we eat some grain it'll give us the energy so that's what we're gonna pack right now good thank you Mama so if you guys ever go on a hike you want to gently pack some grain like this and it's better if you get the Nature Nature Valley because it makes you really feel the nature when you're out there hiking all right so now we got one two three four packs of grains fluff Bean can you give a suggestion on what else should we pack whoa fluff Bean that's a good idea she said some water now fluffy how much water did you drink today none what did you drink you drink Seven large Sodis oh fluffy you gotta drink some water why don't we pack some water that's so funny that Puffin suggested water and she didn't even drink any water today well we got water now and I'm gonna suggest some protein because it's really important like like when you eat the carbohydrate the protein it'll help you too so we got all the Necessities here oh and you have to be wearing the right Footwear I got mine on right here llamas you have the right Footwear oh no the llamas are not wearing any shoes oh I don't know how you're gonna survive on this because I don't know if I have the energies to carry you guys because I'm gonna have to carry myself and look at that guys we're literally climbing that big rock up there okay and I heard it's really slippery and we really have to hold on so llamas I hope you have a good grip on on the Rock so you don't fall off okay well if you don't because I'll save you well I'll try and you know what we never give up so this is gonna be good guys you want to stay tuned until the end of this video to see us climb that okay it's gonna be great all right okay excuse me sir uh fluffy wants to know if the Mountain's slippery how slippery okay Thomas I want you to walk yourself okay because I'm already getting exhausted but you gotta move [Music] commas okay let's go which way this way or that way we're gonna go this way guys we always want to pick the one that looks steeper come on guys you've got to be on the lookout for Bears out here because you don't want to get eaten and you need to really be a safe speed because in this moment you might get eaten by a snake and it's really steep really stupid you gotta step around the rocks and really like like a fun fact is to grip onto the root like so like this and you don't want to slip off this is great guys we're really making progress here check it out we're almost there

      "corpus": "- When you look at me, you probably see a guy who has it all. But really there's a large part of me that's immature, and underdeveloped, especially when it comes to women. Every girl I liked growing up rejected me. And because of that, I've grown into a man who is chronically nervous around women. I'm an emotional midget. Now, if someone came to me with this problem, I'd suggest immersion therapy where you overwhelm yourself with your fear in order to overcome it. So tonight, to inspire you, I'm gonna attempt to overcome my fear of the opposite sex by dating not one, but 10 women at the same time. Wish me luck. This is \"Nathan For You.\" I needed to get 10 women to agree to date me. So I thought it'd be easy to start with someone I work with. So you know how I'm doing the thing on the show where I'm dating like 10 women at the same time? - Yeah. - Are you in a relationship right now? - Yes. - Okay. so, sorry, nevermind. That was stupid to ask. It didn't work. And I knew from experience that women just wouldn't stop and talk to me without an excuse. So I found one. Excuse me, would you like to try our new blueberry raspberry smoothie? - No, thank you. - Okay, come on, just one. Would you like to try one of our new raspberry blueberry smoothies? - Sure, thanks. - I'm just kidding, actually. I don't work here. My name's Nathan. - Nice to meet you. I'm just doing this as a way to break the ice and show my personality. - Oh. - I'm just trying to meet people and... - Cool. You really don't work here? - No. - Oh, okay. - Hey, can you stop giving out smoothies? - I'm just drinking my own smoothie that I bought from here. - Oh, that's not what it looks like. - But I like drinking my smoothie out of little cups on a tray. That's how I like to drink my smoothie. - I need to ask you to move out that way. - Okay, well, I think I'm allowed to drink my smoothie wherever I want. - You need to move this. - Hey. - You need to move this. - You cannot touch my tray. That is crazy. The smoothie thing was too gimmicky anyways, and it felt the same way when I used a cute dog. Do you like my dog? Say hi. - Hi. - [Nathan] But just when I was ready to quit, it hit me. I had a major girl magnet at my disposal that I was totally ignoring. - What are the cameras for? - [Nathan] A television crew. It was a crazy idea, but maybe women would date me just for the opportunity to be on TV. I had my solution. I was gonna create a fake reality show in which 10 women would vie for the heart of one man, me. It would be called the Hunk. It took weeks to prepare as we sorted through the countless submissions from women to my online ad. I like her. But pretty soon we selected the 10 women I would need, hired a host, and rented a mansion. No one knew my show was fake, not even the host. And it was about to begin. - I'm Anthony Napoli. Tonight, 10 women will gather in this house to vie for the heart of one man. Will they find love? Will they find their soulmate? I'm Anthony Napoli. This is the Hunk. (upbeat music) - Hi. - You ready, Nathan? - Yeah. Yeah, I think so. - A little bit nervous? - Kind of. Yeah. - Well, it's time to meet the women. - Where? Where? What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna stand here and I'm gonna introduce you to all the women. - Could you maybe be inside for that? Just because you're very handsome. - I understand that, Nathan, but I'll have to be here. - could you be inside? - I'll have to be here. - Well, if you're next to me, they're gonna love you more. - Trust me, Nathan. You're the hunk, I'm the host. - And women must love you, right? - Ah, I guess they do. - How many women have you slept with? - Not that many. - Have you ever had a threesome? - I have, yes. - Okay. So yeah, go inside please. - Would you like, you would like me to step inside? - Yeah. You can't be out here at all. - No, it's all right. I'll step back. - Can you go inside? - Sure. - Okay. Thank you. I realized too late that hiring a handsome host was a bad idea. But even with Tony in the house, when the women arrived, I got super nervous. - Hi, I'm Emily. Nice to meet you. - Hello, Nathan. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah. - So exciting. - Yeah, it is, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah. - This is fun. - Yeah, yeah. - Totally. It was so nice to meet you. - Yeah. Okay. - Thanks. - Do you wanna go? We could talk more after. Yeah. Yeah. Just for the first bit, just saying hi and... - Yeah. - [Nathan] Even though I was nervous at first. - I love a man in a good suit. - Oh, okay. That's nice. As I met more and more of the women, I found my confidence growing. We have snacks inside and stuff too. Be pretty good. - Awesome. - [Nathan] This was all so cool, 'cause it was just like The Bachelor. - I really like guys have black hair and white skin. It's like, my... - You don't like, you like black guys or..? - I just... - well, we'll talk more inside. I had never had this much attention in my life, and the only thing I had to do to attract them was to create a fake show. The logic didn't really make sense to me, but it was working and I was gonna take advantage of this to try to get over my nervousness around women. - Ladies, I'm your host, Anthony Napoli. Now is your chance to mingle, and get to know your Hunk, Nathan. - You gonna go there? Where you gonna be? - You want me to leave again? - Yeah. Maybe go into the room. - You're kidding me, right? - No. You want me to leave the room again? - Yeah. - Up here? - Sure. - All right. (bright music) - Do you like me? - Yeah. - Do you love me? - Oh. (laughing) How can I tell the person that I love, I need to learn the person first, of course. Yeah. - I mean, I'd hate to eliminate you so soon, so maybe I should ask again. - Oh, do I love you? I love you. - Oh, you do? - I do. I like him. He's a really nice person. But yeah, I love him. - [Nathan] But as the night went on, I realized it didn't matter why they were here. We were both getting what we wanted. I got to work through my nervousness around women. Sorry, I'm kind of shaking. - Don't be nervous. Don't be nervous. That's so cute. - [Nathan] And they got to be on TV. - I would love to have everyone introduced to Canyon Water. This water is one of the best waters out there. It has a pH of 9.5. - I'd never been that good of a flirt, but I had the opportunity to practice with so many beautiful girls. You have beautiful eyes, and beautiful lips, and lovely hair, and your style is wonderful. - Oh, thanks, Nate. - [Nathan] My flirting skills drastically improved. - Do you ride motorcycles? - I don't ride a motorcycle, but I am a bit of a bad boy. But what happened next, I would've never expected. Oh, okay. I think that might be just, I mean, we've only been talking for a few minutes. That might be moving just a little bit fast for me. I just prefer to take things a little slower. No, it's still too soon. We need to take things slow. We just met. - It's okay. - [Nathan] In that moment, everything changed. I wasn't ready to move as quick as she was, but I finally knew what it was like to have a woman come to me. I realized I didn't have to do crazy stunts to get women to like me. I just had to be myself inside a $5,000 per night mansion with a TV crew filming me. But for a guy like me who's gone through an entire lifetime of rejection, knowing that I was desirable was all I needed to no longer be nervous around women. I had accomplished my goal. So I gathered all the women to tell them that the show was over. I've accomplished my goal, and that means, unfortunately, there's no longer a reason for this show, the Hunk, to continue. - Okay. - Are you serious? - Question. So you really, you really, did you get your, you got what you wanted from dating all the girls? You got your fear met? - I think. I think it helped me overcome it, yes. Why? - I'm just wondering. - [Nathan] But others were happy for me. - You've done a great job. - Thank you. I had accomplished what I set out to do. During the course of making my show, I've run into a surprising amount of people I seem to rub the wrong way. - Take your pizza and stick it up your ***. - You know what you are? You remind me of The wizard of loneliness. - You're playing really a dangerous game right now. - Okay. I'm sorry. I'm not sure why that is, but I know that as a TV host, having a personality that people don't like is bad for business. And that's why I needed to make a change. So for the first week of shooting my show this season, I hired a focus group that represents a cross section of American society to watch my every move from a nearby box truck. Tell me a little bit about your business. - We have the doors. We have Mahogany Woods. - Smile. - [Nathan] Using a hidden earpiece, they were able to give me real-time feedback on the fly. - We have Oak. - Express yourself with your hands, with your shoulders, with anything. - So you've got the best prices in town. That would help me become a more likable host. Wow, that's really cool to hear. - Yeah. There you go. - [Nathan] They told me how to engage with my audience more. - Make sure you look in the camera as well. - Like 500 models of doors you could choose from. - Now, do you manufacture all the doors in this building? - We manufacture most of them in this building. Yes. - There you go. Good job. - [Nathan] And they also had some fashion tips to make me more relatable. - I think a V-neck would go well with you. - A V-neck, really? - A blazer. A t-shirt with a blazer might work. - Yeah. That's sort of a popular style right now. That might work. - [Nathan] The only issue we encountered early on was that it was hard for the group to stay focused while we were mobile. (group groaning) But we quickly found a solution to that by bolting down the tables and strapping them in while the truck was moving. As the week went on, I was able to evolve my style to become more in line with their tastes, and a more likable me was starting to take shape. Good to meet you man. So tell me about your foot massage parlor. - Oh, there we go. - Body motions are great. - We do also do facial and the head too. - Now everyone loves a foot massage, right? - Oh, great. You looked out at the camera. - Great looking at the camera. Good job. - The group was absolutely loving who I was now. Now is that a soapy water or is it just plain water? - [Masseuse] Just plain water. - Just water. Wow, that's so interesting. - There you go. - Nice. There you go. - [Nathan] And even though I was still getting used to it, it seemed like I had become a better version of me. But before fully committing to this, I wanted to put my new personality through the ultimate test. Last season on my show, I helped a private investigator named Brian Wolfe, who wasn't too fond of my natural personality. - (bleep) Pink shirt and everything else. Ah, you're killing me. - [Nathan] But now, thanks to the advice of a diverse focus group, I was able to transform into a more likable person. So for my final test, I visited Brian at his home to see what he thought of the new me. So I've come a long way so far, thanks to you. So before I go in tonight to talk to Brian, I just wanted to know, do I look okay? Is all the... - You look good. You're dressed, again, it fits you perfect. The V-neck and the blazer. - This is good? - Yeah. It fits you. It fits you. - So this is me. - This is you. Be proud of who you are. - [Nathan] With those encouraging words. I marched into Brian's house to see if my new personality would win him over. Brian. - Nathan, how you doing? How you been? - I wanna tell you something, Brian. Last time I was here, I was a little nervous, and I wasn't really being myself. So I thought we could do this again. And this time you can get to know the real me. - Look at you. You still a goober, but that's just you. You know what I mean? - What are you talking about goober? What's that mean? - Goober just means like a dork. A nerd. - I'm a nerd? - You know you're a nerd. You've been a nerd your entire life. There's nothing wrong with being a (bleep) nerd. You're a nerd. - I'm not a nerd. - All right, well, you know, that's my opinion. Seriously, if I throw a football at you right now, you think you can catch it? - I could catch the football. - [Brian] You can catch a football? - Yeah. - I doubt it. I doubt you can catch a football. - [Nathan] Brian still didn't like me. And after all the work I had done, I didn't know why. - Don't be sad. It's okay. - [Nathan] Then when I returned to the truck, I was shocked to discover that the group was trying to distance themselves from their own suggestions. - Its too low. The V-neck, it's just too low. - Why didn't you speak up before? I asked before I went in if this was good. - I didn't know it was gonna be that low, man. - What do you mean? You didn't like the V-neck? - Not that low. - I asked you guys before I went in, \"What do you think of this look?\" - V-neck is this, not this. - You guys said you liked the look. - It fits you perfect. The V-neck and the blazer. - [Nathan] That's when I realized there was a major flaw with my entire experiment. This new personality was based on the judgment of four people who had agreed to work out of the back of a moving box truck. Of course it was flawed. In the end, maybe there was nothing I could do to become the guy that everyone loves. But for a brief moment in time, it felt nice thinking that I had a chance. Can I get a little rubby-dub-dub? (group laughing) - Good one. Good one. Good one. - Alright. You know, making this show, I get get a lot of feedback, and one of the most common misconceptions viewers seem to have about me is that I'm a guy who never smiles, and doesn't know how to have fun. And that really bugs me, because it couldn't be further from the truth. In reality, I'm actually very fun, relaxed, and easygoing. Now, obviously, I could just be saying that to you. So tonight I'm going to prove it. How? By spending the entire day with a complete stranger, and measuring his dopamine levels during our hangout, comparing them against a baseline to prove scientifically that he did have fun hanging out with me. To start things off, I went on Craigslist and searched through the listings in the strictly platonic section in order to track down a stranger who'd be willing to spend time with me. I then sent emails to a handful of posters looking to hang out. And the next day after fielding a number of inappropriate responses, I got a nice email from a man named Brendan, who had recently relocated to Los Angeles and seemed eager to make new friends. So we made plans to hang out later that week. But since this was all about proving to you at home that I am indeed fun, I would need to get evidence that cannot be refuted. So I paid a visit to Dr. Whimsy Anderson, a specialist in neurotransmitter testing to advise me on how to scientifically prove a person is fun. - When someone's having fun, you might see an elevation in serotonin, an elevation in dopamine, or an elevation of both serotonin and dopamine, both. - So if their serotonin or dopamine levels go up when they're hanging out with me, that would mean that I'm fun. - For them, yes. - [Nathan] Dr. Whimsy said, to get accurate results, I'd need to obtain two samples of either urine or blood from the person. One before our hangout began to act as a baseline, and a second at the end of doing several activities together. But knowing it would skew the results if he was aware of what was being tested, I would have to obtain Brendan's urine without his knowledge. So prior to his arrival at my office, I set up a tempting selection of beverages in the waiting area. Then in the bathroom, I put an out of order sign on the toilet and attached a clear plastic bag to the urinal mat, creating a reservoir that would discreetly collect any liquid stream on its way down the drain. With everything set and me positioned in a van outside, I watched as moments later, Brendan arrived. To buy as much time as possible, I sent him a text telling him I was running late, and to wait for me in the lobby. After only a few minutes, he began browsing the selection of drinks, and eventually settled on a Dr. Pepper. Then a half hour later, the moment I've been waiting for finally came as Brendan got up and headed towards the bathroom, hopefully to deposit what would be our baseline urine sample. So once he was done, it was time to head in to introduce myself. Brendan? - Yeah. Hey, Nathan. - Yeah, Brendan, how you doing? - Hey, nice to meet you. - Yeah. - I'm just gonna go to the bathroom and we can head out. - Okay. Yeah. - [Nathan] I pretended that I had to go to the bathroom too, but in reality it was just so I could transfer the sample from the secret urinal chamber into the specimen cup while it was still fresh. Meanwhile, one of my production assistants informed Brendan that our day was gonna be filmed for a documentary about Craigslist Hangouts. And Brendan seemed more than happy to participate. - Yeah, sure. - [Nathan] With his sample sealed, I hid it underneath a hollowed out candle, and then lit the wick to signal to my unpaid intern that it was ready to be taken to the lab for testing. And with the sample secured, I could finally begin my day with Brenton. So, we're gonna go into a hat store and try on silly hats. - Okay. Let's do it. - That's fun, right? - Yeah. - I mean, that's something, is that fun for you? - Yeah, let's do it. Let's go. - All right. - Oh, this is pretty cool. - [Nathan] Trying on hats is something everyone can enjoy. And it was the perfect way to show Brendan that I'm the type of guy who doesn't take himself too seriously. This is what girls would wear, so... - Yeah. - I don't know about this one. But Brendan wasn't having the reaction I expected. And after we left, I was doubtful his neurotransmitters were sufficiently raised by the hat store experience. So I was counting on the day's next activity to do the trick. You like go-karts? - Hell yeah. - Yeah? Right away I could tell Brendan was excited. - I've gotta go with red because of the red factor in Star Trek. - All right. Go-Karting is like normal driving, except the car is so much smaller. So the fun comes from the fact that you know your body is too big for the car. And as we started going around the track, I could tell it was working as Brendan was smiling from ear to ear. (Brendan laughing) It seemed like his fun levels were peaking, so I wanted to get his second sample as quickly as possible. But since waiting for his urine again could take hours. I had a plan to get this sample immediately at a clinic via blood test. The only thing I had to do now was convince him to go. You know, I was thinking, we should do something totally random, you know? - Yeah. What do you, is there something you wanna do? - I don't know. We should like, we should like go for like a blood test or something. Like, wouldn't that be crazy? So random. Just go to a lab and get our blood drawn and stuff. - A blood test? An actual blood test? - Yeah. - I haven't done that. Yeah, we can do that. That sounds cool. - I mean, they're pretty fun to do. - I don't, yeah, let's to do blood test. It'd be kind of cool. - [Nathan] And with Brendan on board, we were off. Coming off the thrill of go-kart racing, I wanted to harvest Brendan's blood as quickly as possible. So we headed to a nearby medical clinic where I had prearranged for the necessary lab work. To make sure his levels didn't drop due to the unfun setting, I asked the nurse if she'd be willing to hide an electronic fart machine on her person, that I'd be able to activate by remote control during the blood draw. Do you think you could do that? - I'll try my best. - My hope was that Brendan would think they were real farts and that the fun of that would spike his dopamine levels right as the blood was being taken. - Who's going first? - I guess I'll go first. - Do you want to? Okay, yeah. And with Brendan in his seat, it was time to see if this would work. (fart noise) - Sorry about that. (fart noise) My apologies. (fart noise) Sorry. - You have some gas today? - Nope. I'm okay. I'm okay. - Oh, oh, you're okay? - Yeah, sorry about that. - Okay. It's okay. (fart noise) - Sorry. - Yeah. I mean, you should stay home if you're that sick. - I apologize for that. - [Nathan] I mean, if your bowels are... - I'm okay. And we're just done. So I will be stepping out in a moment. (fart noise) Sorry about that. (fart noise) Upset stomach today. Sorry. - It's okay. (fart noise) - Apologies. - [Nathan] The farts were working, and it seemed like Brendan was having the time of his life. Okay, so I'm gonna do mine and then I'll see you. - Okay, cool. - That was great. See, he was laughing. - Yeah, it was good. - Okay. So with everything I needed, it was time to say goodbye to Brendan. - Oh, okay. I'll catch you on the flip side, man. - Flip side? - On the flip side. Means catch you later, dude. - All right, see you man. - [Brendan] Yeah, see ya. - [Nathan] But whether this would translate into actual science was still to be seen. So later that week I returned to Dr. Whimsy's office, nervously awaiting the results. - His serotonin when he started was within normal range. The number was 87.22. The day of fun, it was 219.92. So it shot up 2.5 times what it initially was. - Well, that's huge. - They're very impressive numbers. So this person who was with you was not only having fun, but they were happy and they had a greater sense of wellbeing when they were with you. - Wow. That's amazing. Because, you know, I've, I think a part of me has always had this thing, ever since I was a kid that, you know, people maybe don't like hanging out with me. And you know, even though they might say they're having fun, they're really not. And it's really hard to, you know, have those thoughts. I think it can really take a toll on your self-esteem a bit, you know? But now if anyone questions me and and ever says that I'm not fun or is uncomfortable hanging out with me, I can say, \"No, you're wrong. I am fun. And it's been scientifically proven.\" Sorry, I just kind of opened up to you. You're not, I don't know. - No, that's cool. I think it's great. I think it's great. - [Nathan] There was no denying it. After getting the data from Dr. Whimsy, I now had scientific proof that I am fun. (epic music)"

is going to be I've had enough of her bratty Behavior this video is probably gonna be taken off the internet immediately from Taylor Swift I'm probably gonna get demonetized because she is that powerful and scary right now somehow she's got everyone in a daze somehow she's hypnotizing with you to make you think that she's this amazing thing when she is not how do you not see through what she's doing right now I've had it issue with Taylor Swift ever since I posted a video Shake It Off for Shake It Off I did a music video to that it was credible millions and millions of millions views I'm talking like 70 million views what happened to it disappear Taylor freaking Swift sorry got jealous that my video had more views than hers and had deleted from the internet I'm not kidding there's proof in a pudding where is it guys go search it where's that video gone she got deleted from the internet because she's jealous of me everyone's always like oh Taylor Swift has all these Easter eggs look at her Easter eggs yep the problem with Taylor is she keeps talking about these Easter eggs that she's hiding everywhere in her videos and stuff I never once seen an egg not a single egg in any video I have looked at all of them I swear it's hard to find egg than it is to find Waldo in those where's Waldo books there's not a single egg in a single music video for us not one why is she so obsessed with eggs anyway they're gross no one likes the egg no matter how you cook it gives you freaking stomach ink scrambled eggs tummy ache over easy tummy ache hard-boiled tummy ache why she's so obsessed with them it's weird are you a chicken tailor why do you like eggs so much why are you always talking about eggs when I was talking about Easter eggs it's not even Easter it's Christmas time almost oh my throat anyway I'm really taked off I'm not from a single egg but people keep saying oh she leaves clues about secrets and her music and in her videos and things okay she has been obsessed with me for years first of all she deleted my video like I told you but second of all she did an entire song or album or something called red she's obsessed with color red what does red remind you of hmm red is literally my color I own red red is in linear in the color on my lips and I've been screaming this from the freaking rooftops I've been trying to get a hold of her writing her fan letters every night when you open it says I am not a fan this is a request please see some desist talking about me so I'm like stop saying red stop saying red stop talking about my color what does she do on her new album she mocks me comes out with a song called maroon maroon is literally red she's calling it something else like a brat to try to trick everyone and think she's not talking about me also Sheila is like oh and what's this guy named Joe or something like that she keeps talking about that but then in the oven she said she has a boyfriend and his name is karma which first of all stupid name but also you're literally admitting in a song that you have a boyfriend when you are in a serious relationship for six years okay or just forgiving this but you guys she's a little obsessed with me she's been copying me for years I do shaking off video she is Shake It Off video copycat she deletes my video I wrote my lipstick she wears red lipstick complicated I literally have went on tour this year and I've been touring I'm going to Portland Seattle next make sure I have lots of different tour dates what does she just do announce it's a tour copy me copycat literally yet to gain I have cats literally on my shirt I even own cats what does she do oh I love cats I have cats I want cats cats cats copycats literally no pun in Dandy but that's not why I'm making this video I'm making this video to warn you guys that she's brainwashing you she's literally creating a cult and none of you are seeing it but I see right through it listen closely the real purpose of this video is to warn you because she came out with a song where she says it's um hi I'm the problem is me are you kidding me you guys don't see through this you don't see the problem with this she's creating a cold because she knows she's gonna go on tour and she can be singing her freaking song she's singing the song right and she gets the chorus whatever one of the celebrities do when they're on tour and they get to the course microphone she's gonna do that sing along and she can put that microphone out to you guys you're all gonna be singing millions of people it's me hi I'm a problem it's me yeah gonna be screaming at the top of your lungs literally manifesting telling the whole universe you are the problem no one likes you who's not seeing those lyrics at that point Taylor Swift shut the microphone out to you you don't look like a freaking clown she's got millions of people singing to her she's on stage I'm the problem I'm awful no one likes me and she's just gonna stand there like gotchaun congrats kids now you're in a cult where you're admitting that you're terrible and she is amazing then what is gonna happen she's convinced you all that she puts Easter eggs everywhere everyone's always talking about these Easter eggs there's never been a single one in sight seeing is believing I believe I never seen a single egg anywhere how long are you guys gonna fall for this granny Behavior Taylor Swift needs to be stopped she needs to be canceled we should not be putting up with this any longer her she's playing games with us not the fun kind she let her on her tick tocks like oh look I'm gonna play Bingo she's a little Bingo thing with bingo balls she keeps doing it every day she's doing Bingo no one ever wants Bingo no one ever yelled Bingo did anyone else catch that we never finished the game so she's literally just like teasing us making us say negative things about herself and meaning to cheating on her boyfriend it mean to be obsessed with me mocking me copying me by going on tour same time as me she's like oh buy four of my albums the same exact one have I literally ever put out merch and been like buy four of the same exact shirt no but I should anyway this video is just a PSA don't warn you all that you're in a freaking cool and that I know every single one of Taylor Swift Easter eggs and you know what they are non-existent because there's never been a single leg in any video anyway I just want to let you all know that you're in a freaking call to be aware of Taylor Swift she is being crazy in a complete brand so just wanted to warn you guys

these cameras are tracking all the uh reflective balls on us right now and now we're actually right here we are the what's the Gertie oh yeah exactly all right Ryan welcome and thanks for doing this test podcast with us no problem how this works so you guys are probably seeing us in Moab right now but welcome welcome to not a normal podcast we're here in the astroverse yeah this is my my new studio you see like I like the wood I like what you did with the barn I'm kind of like a little it's like a rift in the metaverse we're going for oh I'm sorry it's like a rift in the ashes okay cool we're staying away from that m word I see that that's that's old news this is the astroverse everybody and welcome welcome to not a normal Park as you can see I got this sign made I like it it's very LED yeah it's pretty cool but um so yo I feel like I haven't seen you forever it's been a while it's been at least a year since we've seen each other in person and maybe even two did you think you're gonna come over like if you could think back 10 years ago like we'd be sitting in full motion capture in sort of a digital space having a podcast talk I would have thought I was having a stroke if you said that to me 10 years ago but oh wait there's a there's a there's an ambulance driving by here open yep in the Astro versus oh I see them yeah okay thank you for your for your work sir um yeah so what was the saying no I would have never expected to be in this exact place with you 10 years later uh all right so we're just testing things out and obviously you're our first test guest yes and I was like as we're doing this we're trying to figure out what other cool guests would be we put on the show like do you have any I like the Nostalgia I like all the YouTubers from I would love to see you know like the Romans of the world and Charles and like just people that could have some conversation about old school YouTube since I'm so Nostalgia nostalgic over it and I like miss it deeply and I get sad about it just because I think that YouTube's in a place that's just not as good as it was 10 years ago it's just way more manufactured and fake so with all the algorithms and and and AI you know it's funny like when people talk oh AI this AI this AI that and like ai's been around since we've been kids in the Sixers I mean he was winning MVPs and no yeah no I I it's been it's been brewing for a while it's just kind of like showing its head now I feel like AI as technology it's taking over we're like more accessible to us you know like the first time I thought this is funny but like the first time I thought wow technology is really advancing was Snapchat when they first came out with the rainbow puke filter where you would stick your tongue out I know that's basically AI that's really nice basically learning you know where your face is in space was that like the first real main one that happened right that was a big deal in that case when it came when it comes to like face filters yeah yeah or no it was the dog ears yeah I remember just all day just being like wow I do look like a dog but like the the on YouTube like AI was being used to understand what was holding people's attention and what was what would serve you like so they're taking all your data when you watch YouTube and process it through an AI algorithm right to figure out what to serve you on YouTube to keep you on there long enough and like that's always been going on and kind of manipulating us yeah to like you know watch what they want us to watch yeah so now that we're kind of getting more knowledgeable about AI not just Allen Iverson and uh and and speaking of AI we were gonna one of our things on this podcast is we're going to have an AI co-host that's what we're building right now his name is Astro we're actually teaching him how to speak and animate all in real time So eventually like he'll be here on the show he could come in we could ask some questions and have a full conversation that's wild that's crazy to even think about you're just like building him right now like yeah piece by piece basically in a lab we're using Unreal Engine which is what this is right now okay and we're we're partnering with one AI company that's helping us build the brains okay of the of the robot in which he'll be able to you know crawl the internet for his knowledge but also the crazy thing about him is he'll remember the conversations we had with guests wow so we can learn from that you learn from that right so it's gonna be pretty crazy so like eventually he'll come walking in like we'll walk into this scene right now we could start talking on the next podcast if I hope you guys like this and you want to keep doing this uh Astro will join us every talk on the podcast um I was going to ask you this question since it is a podcast since I I'm not sure if you know but do you remember when uh we met for the first time do you remember like the year I'm curious to see your memory on these things uh uh okay let me really draw my memory I it was back when I don't really remember 1986. I don't remember how we came to be no I will tell you we attended a back in the day YouTube used to be like they have they had the partner meetups and yeah Google certain YouTubers who had a certain amount of followers on the East Coast Google and YouTube would throw like a little thing where we'd get together and like learn stuff and people would speak and I went to that in like 2011 which makes me feel old holy that's scary 11. yeah yeah oh yeah because I started on YouTube in like 2000 maybe in 2010 that happened it was a long time ago and uh basically what happened was I was living in Jersey and Jesse was also living in Jersey at the time and uh we didn't know how close we were to each other and I was about to miss my train and then you and Jen were like well wait you live like 10 minutes from us we'll just drop you off and I was like wow oh yeah YouTubers aren't so bad you know and then you guys it's crazy I have no I cannot remember I thought we took the train back you don't remember it was such a memorable conversation I just remember the first Meetup and that day storm today storm was there daystorm was there uh there was a lot who was the woman that was in charge of YouTube oh I forget her name I'm not gonna remember but I know I got a free YouTuber yeah it was pretty um but naltz was there do you remember nalts uh Sandstorm was there um political mystery guitar man just some people that the OG YouTubers know like in the YouTube viewers know yeah um but yeah so you guys dropped me off and you know we had like a good convo but the thing that was funny about it was the next day I was talking to Bob and I was like Jesse was really cool but you you like introduced Jen as your girl but like the whole time so I didn't even know her name name until like we were about to get out of the car after like the yeah two hours time she wanted to be yeah I I don't remember at all but like that conversation or that day but knowing her back then it was like she didn't want anyone to know her name even if we met you in person like she didn't know who you were she's like oh no one so she was probably like don't tell him my name so every time I introduce her to you or mentioned her name was my girlfriend and then and then when you found out her name was Gina that was even her name lied to me again I felt Bamboozled twice she because when she was a you know she was studying to be a teacher and all and she really didn't know like what this was it was also brain like she didn't want any because you know teachers their jobs could be affected so easily with things like this so she was worried that it could affect her job but obviously she never went to off to be a teacher she just continued to be this YouTuber which I don't even think YouTubers were coined as a not in 2010-11 no we were then we were just weirdos right and and even the word influencer well I still hate that word I know I hate it too but it wasn't even a word yet like I feel like yeah no when did I think Jake Paul brought that about I feel like 2015-16 the Jake Paul Logan Paul world influencer I just remember people saying are you an influencer and I would like in my I'd be like oh God no don't don't call me that oh I hated when that switch happened but like I say funny thing about uh Jen was one time I was at your guy's house and I was filming a vlog so I was watching your cat at the time and in the background like 60 feet away I had a there was I guess a piece of mail from you guys and I got a phone call from Jen and she was like you might have to delete your video because like she had telescope but she was able to like Zone in on a bill in the background and I think she did make me delete the video and I was like but she was always very cautious about being docs yeah like she was really scared about that stuff so yeah for me I was editing Vlogs every day and like she would pick apart any little things that show yeah to you to the car or yeah yeah but like we kept us safe we never got you know that's what she did yeah she did it right no one ever knew where the hell we live we never showed the outside of our house and uh no one figured it out you know you guys watching right now this podcast I just want to take a this is the our first test yeah right so his hands you can see his hand look at his hands you know they're a little bit they're a little compact right now you know because we're not tracking his hands but my hands work how are you doing can we touch it my hands feel like we're pretty close to one for one for one yeah I just feel like I have a mannequin hand that's all it's like you know it's it's I mean you are Ryan Gosling right this is Ken yeah this is me cosplay that's exactly what Halloween costume you should do this year you saw the photos he was wearing the neon I saw I actually saw them shooting that here in Venice and of course my you know crazy ass would run up to the car would y'all filming the Barbie movie man thanks appreciate it uh yeah no this I mean this this is this is we're just dialing things in and there might be a little lag when we like switch the camera because we're working out how to do multiple camera angles I feel like by the way we could probably talk about YouTube for eight hours so people watching if you want more of this I'm swear to God we could probably do a three-hour episode yeah I mean we were me and you were talking earlier about Fouseytube are you allowed to talk about that yeah yeah I could talk about that it was because so and we were talking and we were also talking about like um like it almost feels like every really big YouTuber always ends up going through something dramatic or a big difference in their life it happens and especially the like when they get really big like think about David dobrik right David dobrik and all that stuff you know he went through and then our girl Jenna Marbles yeah you know I love it yeah and it's like she got canceled over a fish did you know that it was stupid it was over a fish tank really I don't I don't just like wasn't big enough people were saying and then she just like and she's like I don't want this heat yeah and she said I can't and then and they were thinking like you know how how massive well no we were talking about like it was crazy back in like 2014 2015 I can't remember the year but Jen and I's Channel BF versus GF and practice prank at one point were like the most viewed YouTube channel one and two for like a couple months straight wow we were number one and number two most food for the month on like vid stats and then we're like damn we think about who who's that now and that's like a Mr Beast and I don't feel anywhere close to the reach that Mr B says a guy we were we're too early for our time what was like the Prelude of it like YouTube was still even though it felt big that it was still huge but it wasn't at the point where it is now where it has taken over like just cable at this point like it is TV so I I think Mr B's Channel generates probably more views in any sort of network yeah exactly for sure anywhere easily and then we're also talking about like with all that attention you get somebody it's his age too yeah like I was older so I feel like I was a little able a little easier for me to get through it but like all that attention that you get on your mental health yeah and and um you know you trying to do better than your last video and then when it starts not doing better or whatever you make I just feel like something's gonna happen Mr B's I don't know what it is but mark my words from this podcast there's gonna be some sort of thing that happens and we're all like damn well it's impossible to be that on all the time constantly without having some mental issues because like you said like and you went through this I went through this on YouTube like having to one-up your last video uploading a video that did well and people saying it's so good is a great feeling until you have to upload another one and then you're like oh man this isn't going to be as good as my last one right and then you're always chasing that and it's like it's it's think about it now when we were coming up the YouTube titles were like kind of easy I mean she did what and it was like whatever now every video you know or at least it has been for five years now it's like if you're not giving away 10 grand if you didn't give a homeless guy a house if you didn't rank oh no Casey still is able to there's a novel I know because he's a genius Casey is an anomaly but for the most part I started really hating the part of YouTube that turned into this you have to have money and give away money to get close yeah and then actually I just saw Casey on on uh talk about something on the podcast recently he was talking about how he was sad about YouTube because there's all these things to kind of gain the system of the algorithms and you gotta you gotta make your videos like that which take away from creativity right and he's like I don't even I don't care about that I'm just going to make what I think is creative and blah blah blah and he's right though because now it's like you got to do all these things and like the thumbnail has got to be perfect and it's got to have someone's face in it with their eyes wide open and their mouth open and then the first 10 seconds gotta be some over the top thing it's too much it's like we're we're steering away of making videos that we want to make and have to make them towards this algorithm and it's stressful for me like I'm having a hard time I I'm not I'm not finding the inspiration to want to get on here and do it so so you're telling me like bro I think you're overthinking it and just oh yeah you I want you to just I want you to start number one posting stuff I think you're awesome stuff right here you know me I always got to innovate your audience doesn't need everything to be Innovative though some things can be Innovative but you could just give them a 50 minute Vlog and I guarantee you they will love it so but who's saying any podcast like this oh this is crazy you're you're literally in a video game having a conversation yeah no this is next level um and this is the start this is just a test guy so like it's only gonna get better from here I see people like you are you're hard on yourself because you try to elevate but so you know and this is insane but remember you have a lot of people that watch you I'm supposed to you and that's why I talk about the Nostalgia of it is like I'm sure we can get on we can talk about this another time like do you ever think about how weird it is that a lot of people because I get this in my streams now will come into like yeah I feel like I kind of grew up with you you you know like I watched you when I was 10 and now I'm 23. yeah because that stuff make you feel weird because sometimes I think about it I'm like there are millions of people especially with you where like you kind of like were a part of their life for yeah so long what's that feel like um I guess doesn't feel real like it doesn't it doesn't register the impact that I probably had on her life I never let it really register in my brain on what sort of impact which is crazy now that I'm sitting here trying to register it nuts because yeah I mean still to this day I have a lot of people that come up to me yo oh my god Jess you're my entire childhood I grew up watching you every day yep and that it doesn't like register like what does that mean right but then I gotta put myself in their shoes and like okay who did I like you know look it up to every day and it was like music artists or yeah whatever and like to think about that it's crazy because it does make a difference yeah yeah it does um yeah it's that's yeah because it's just crazy to look back on how many different because I had somebody last month at a Target to come up to me and then bring up the prank we did at Target I was like damn it's just crazy 10 plus years later people but like think about no one's done anything like in stuff like that maybe Ed that was a that was one of the first maybe in-store ones so yeah well maybe Ed was playing around in stores like that not as an employee right right but like just to think of what that created for now like that's still going on like crazy like we created a whole genre I remember I forget how that happened but I think I hit you up like one night and I was like let's do this and then you were immediately like yes but what people don't realize and for people that watch that how many views did that get a lot a lot back then it was 20 million or something we went to like uh four Walmarts in that video and got kicked out of each one do you remember uh was it Walmart I'll tell us quick story because it was one of the more viral videos we were to Target like in cinnamonson so what happened was we went to a bunch of right yeah immediately got kicked out of the first Walmart My Boy Bobby was with me shout out to Bobby went to a couple more another Walmart about five minutes in got kicked out again and then we were like damn it's not working out so then we drove to another we drove to a star a Target and we were in there for two and a half hours and film the whole video and then that was it so what turned out to be a disaster I just remember when the manager walks up he's like you know you were very like no don't worry about it yeah that was and what's funny about that video oh the ball doesn't do anything like that again my friends asked me about that they're like yo you seem like you're more like anxious now for like I wouldn't not want to do that again like I mean I could do it again it scares me but the for about a month and a half that video went so viral that anytime I went into a target for a bit I swear I got looked at by every employee because they'd be like I they would Trail around me and follow me around and I have so many funny there I was I ran into some groceries that was my teacher like she was like oh the one that Dad that I messed with the one oh yeah that was my teacher but yo bro we just think about like how all these videos back in the day in public how lucky we didn't get a shot we didn't get sued well do you remember you got a little nervous from Target something happened I you probably won't remember but somebody sent you something and it was from Target I remember you sent me a text really yeah and we were nervous the target was gonna like Sue because the video This is how crazy it was back in the day my aunt I remember the two the next day or two days later she did she called and was like ice you're like on the front page of the MSN oh yeah it went crazy because it was Black Friday and and I was like oh yeah and that's when that first time she was like what's going on like why are you on the front page in the internet right now you know and that was the first time I had to explain to my dad like what was going on because he saw it on yahoo.com yeah that was back in the day when we would make prank videos and then tons of news outlets would pick them up and share them and like we had it down to a science like we knew what to make for them to all pick it up and then we'd go viral that doesn't happen now no it's different now I don't know why but it changed that none of that happens yeah yeah that was like is it because it's just been diluted yeah for sure like everyone's like oh this was something that got popular and now I just got diluted it had a great run but we were pioneers of that and then yeah anyways I know this is just gonna be I mean I'm telling you it could be hours so yeah we can go hours we only wanted to just get on here and do a little test show you guys the capabilities yes and if you wanted me to bring Ryan back on we definitely can just let me know in the comments also we should talk about who what other guests who what other guests but uh oh my my face my my face just died oh my face died but uh my face died look I got no pain we've been going at this for so long come on wow oh wow look at this a jerk face die too oh oh thanks for coming on the show thanks Ryan I appreciate you thanks for having me it's gonna be a little technical difficulties this is our first shot at this but uh yeah let's do it let's do it thanks for coming through Ryan and helping us test this yeah thank you for having me it's been too long it get some more content out Jesse what you don't know James is running out like a maniac he's the one that was controlling this computer that computer the audio Lauren's over here running around moving things it's yo for a production like this to be four people is pretty or two or one that little podcast you watched was just a test we didn't even know if we were going to post it and I was like why would we just throw that away we should show it to you so there was a lot of problems with the camera switching and triggering different um animations and stuff so it's only going to get better from there and we're also going to be putting this all on a new YouTube channel where the podcast is going to live so I want you to go to the link below and go subscribe to the new channel it's not a normal podcast that's where we're going to be having all these videos live and I also talked about there being an AI element this is our Astro character and he is got AI brain so he'll be on the podcast and we wanted to demonstrate what we've been building with you guys no Astro I want you to send off the viewers they're watching right now tell them all to go over and subscribe to the new channel where we're going to host the podcast cyberspace it's your boy Astra how many of you live in Direction but not a normal podcast now listen up I know you're all other hustling and bustling but take a moment to show some love to the new channel get on over there because you know we're going to be driving some serious knowledge bombs that I curtail and everything in between so don't be a square hop on over and subscribe you're not a normal podcast Channel trust me you won't

      "corpus": "[Music] hey Vsauce Michael here on July 1st of 2015 a long-standing ban was lifted visitors were finally allowed to take selfies at the White House this is the first legal selfie ever taken on a White House Tour but a year before the ban was lifted in February of 2014 I met with the president and secretly took an illegal selfie while on the toilet In The West Wing thanks Obama why am I admitting to this crime now well it's time for the truth who took the first selfie really few people would call this a selfie but it is the oldest known self-portrait a depiction someone made of themself that includes Head and Shoulders it was sculpted more than three thousand years ago by Pharaoh akhenaten's first Chief Royal sculptor A guy named Beck next to himself Beck sculpted his wife to Heart making this also a contender for oldest known asy but the roots of the selfie go back further than this we have been making things that resemble ourselves in whole or in part intentionally or not for as long as there's been cause and effect just looking into a pool of water creates a kind of selfie A Primitive ephemeral one that you can't preserve or send to anyone but it is undeniably an image of the self made by the self even the earliest life forms on Earth were capable to some degree of self-discrimination they could differentiate themselves from the environment around them they have inside them in some chemical form a crude pre-conscious sense of themselves I call things like that a first wave selfie first wave selfies are unintentional automatic or accidental resemblances something makes of itself in whole or in part like prehistoric human Footprints or the mental images animals have of their own bodies the first big leap in selfie history the second wave began with the first intentional depictions of oneself second wave selfies include everything from Chauvet caves 32 000 year old hand stencil prints to the paintings of Jan Von Ike and Judith leister but in the 19th century self-depiction changed in another Major Way a technology emerged that allowed likenesses of the self to be made faster and with less skill that seemed more accurate less mediated and more indexical than ever before photography ushered in the third wave selfie in the fall of 1839 outside his family's lamp and chandelier store in Philadelphia thirty-year-old Robert Cornelius stood completely still for about 15 minutes in front of a camera he built using a modified opera glass and a sheet of silver plated copper the result was a significant image it could be found on his gravestone in Philadelphia's Laurel Hill Cemetery the Smithsonian calls it the first selfie but they also don't in that same fall of 1839 a man named Henry Fitz Jr took a photograph of himself in Baltimore Smithsonian Magazine and pretty much everyone else has called cornelius's Selfie the first but in their archives the Smithsonian calls Fitz Juniors the first the reason for this confusion is that honestly we don't know which of these came first all we can be sure of is that neither of them is the first equally by r a Frenchman wrote of taking a photo of himself in 1837 two years before these but it's been lost and other even earlier examples may have been lost as well because these are photographs people took of themselves it's largely uncontroversial to call them selfies but you know they're not like selfie selfies if you've seen my video is cereal soup you know what I just did there contrastive Focus reduplication that's when you repeat a word in order to focus on prototypical examples in contrast to edge cases for example we went on a date last night but you know it wasn't a date date in that statement I'm contrasting what I did last night which might have been a date to a true date date which is obviously a date okay anyway the point is no one called these selfies when they were taken they were photographic self-portraits the word selfie wouldn't even exist for another 160 years after they were taken so at some point between this and this our relationship to self-depiction changed and our vocabulary had to expand to discuss it what rough Beast emerged to make the coining of selfie necessary well let's keep going around 1846 Czech photographer MV lobethal took the earliest known selfie with a mirror this of course would become a classic selfie technique mirrors provided an easy early way to capture the self with a camera but in my opinion this mirror selfie from around 1900 is the most arresting I think you die at least three times once when your body stops living again usually sometime later when your name is spoken for the last time but now thanks to photography more and more of us are able to save ourselves from the third the last time and image of you is seen the identity of this woman is unknown that makes it the oldest known selfie taken by a person whose name we have forgotten this is the oldest known example of the classic outstretched arm selfie technique it was taken by Joseph Byron in 1909 images like these were a significant step toward the eventual fourth wave selfie the presence of a camera or arms or poles in the shot evidence of how it was made are Hallmarks of the modern day selfie stereotype for example a 2013 ad campaign for the cape times reimagined famous historical photographs as selfies and in every single one an arm connecting the subject to the camera was used five years after Byron's armed selfie Anastasia nikolivino Romanova the youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II and great-granddaughter to Britain's queen Victoria and Prince Albert took this photo of herself she was 13 years old at the time so many have claimed it to be the first selfie ever taken by a teenager but that's not true in 1852 61 years earlier British chemist William Henry Perkin took this photo of himself when he was just 14. however even though Anastasia wasn't the first teenager to take a selfie in another way she was unlike Perkins whose shot feels like a self-portrait she took pictures that feel much more like we today would call selfies the photos she took were personal she sent them to friends to share her mood and daily life here she is posing with fake novelty teeth in 1915 or 16. four years after taking this famous selfie her camera was confiscated and not long after Bolshevik revolutionaries executed her and her entire family together in a basement conclusive evidence of her death in 1918 wasn't uncovered until 2007. although her work was cut short she pioneered the use of Photography as a social behavior as a way to communicate not just commemorate she has been called the Kardashian of her day but despite her influence she was more of a trendsetter for hairstyles than photography she didn't usher in a worldwide shift in Behavior where young people everywhere started taking selfies camera manufacturers didn't rush to make self-portraiture easier and articles weren't written about how great or how scary it was that young people were taking pictures of themselves though the modern day selfie still wasn't born it continued to gestate and kick within the womb one such kick was the use of sticks and pulls to activate a camera's shutter in 1925 newlyweds Arnold and Helen Hogg used a long Pole to take this picture in 1934 Helmer Larson used a fallen tree branch to snap this selfie with his wife naime in Sweden on Reddit Chooch 37 shared his grandfather using a selfie stick in the late 1940s here's one from 1957 and going back to 1920 here's Joseph Byron taking a handheld photograph with others I mentioned this image because a second camera captured how it was taken giving us an early depiction of what is now the recognizable human selfie pose now what I think makes this image so significant is that it's another early Taste of the selfie as we know it today as Jin's rushitz pointed out in exploring the selfie if you Google self-portrait you get a lot of self-portraits there's only one image that shows someone making a self-portrait Norman Rockwell's famous triple self-portrait but if you Google selfie a lot of what you get aren't selfies they're pictures of people taking selfies four the selfie as we know it today the pose of taking one is just as if not more Salient than the actual result blogs and articles containing outrage over people taking selfies in inappropriate places or when they should be behaving differently rarely complain about the actual images they dislike the performance in 2015 Joanne paternapatania published a book of pictures of people taking selfies from which she had removed the environment giving us what feel like selfie poses preserved in specimen jars the idea that those taking photos can be a nuisance didn't begin with selfies far from it there's a long tradition of photographers especially tourists raising eyebrows for being annoying centering themselves over the location and being predictably heard like for example the Pisa pushers found in Italy the modern day selfie that was to come however makes a person look like a tourist everywhere they go not because everything suddenly became a landmark but because people have always loved looking at themselves and as cameras became smaller and easier to handle it was inevitable that people would start snapping more self-portraits Vivian Dorothy Meyer took really cool mirror selfies in the 1950s and 60s but she kept them to herself her selfies were unknown and unpublished during her lifetime a couple of years before her death she failed to make payments on a storage unit she rented and her Works were auctioned off six months after her death in 2009 a collector who had acquired them uploaded her images to Flickr and they went viral inspiring exhibitions a documentary a road in Paris was even named after her the popularization of instant cameras in the 60s and 70s made taking selfies physically and mentally easier you didn't need to know how to develop the film yourself or feel self-conscious turning in selfies to be developed but instant cameras with mirrors on the front didn't come around until decades later selfies still hadn't reached a Tipping Point in 1969 Michael Collins took the first reverse selfie a photograph that contains everyone but yourself Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin are in this Lander right here and every human living or dead at that time is on this ball of Rock Only Collins himself behind the lens is absent in 1983 Hiroshi wada submitted a patent for a telescopic extender for supporting a compact camera an early selfie stick and two years prior Lester wisbrod started what was to become a personal tradition using his new auto focusing compact camera to snap selfies with famous people whiz broad was the pioneer of the celebrity selfie still though no one was using the word selfie selfies hadn't become a thing yet but then something happened in Japan in 1995 19 year old toshikawa haromi known as hero mix was nominated for the new Cosmos of Photography award by world renowned photographer Nobi Yoshi araki she submitted a portfolio of snapshots she'd taken of her daily life and she won the grand prize there was already a unique culture of photo diary and photo booth use among young people in Japan but hero mix's sudden Fame amongst teenagers and the educated Elite made the practice a thing suddenly young people all over Japan wanted to be like her the New York Times called it hero mix syndrome increased demand for cameras that made self-portraiture and proto-instagramming easier LED camera manufacturers to speed up the release of features that served immediate frequent photography hero mix took a lot of photos tens of thousands and her work generated polarized reactions some critics adored her While others found it all baffled now by the time selfies were called selfies the same debate was started again but it was a about the behavior hero mix had brought into focus more than a decade before you know it's hard to say who took the first selfie but in my opinion hero mix took the first selfie selfie her work hastened and christened the arrival of the fourth wave selfie the selfie as we know it today now if it hadn't been her it would have been someone else people love looking at themselves and it was becoming easier and easier to do so but hero mix popularized taking pictures of yourself as a social sharing activity more akin to speaking than remembering less a memory than a message nowhere is this more clear than in the story of the first camera phone picture on June 11 1997 while his wife was in labor Philippe Khan Jerry rigged together a makeshift system involving his star attack flip phone a Casio QV and a Toshiba laptop when his daughter was born he took a photo with the camera and used the laptop and phone connection to immediately email the image to more than 2 000 people social media is strongly associated with the fourth wave selfie but as we've seen it wasn't its origin instead social media was simply a mouth that showed up later and demanded to be fed them online we have no bodies we can't just walk in and be seen we have to upload images of our bodies for them to be there selfies are an easy solution because they don't require other people's help but on top of that there's a sense in which a photo of yourself taken by someone else is that person's point of view it's their story but a selfie well a selfie's point of view doesn't belong to another person when I look at a selfie of you I'm not a third Observer looking at you through someone else's eyes it's just me looking at you selfies allow us to be online first hand not second hand in the same way that brown bears who migrated to the cold lands of the north evolved pale guard hairs and became polar bears as humans migrated into the cold lands of the screen they evolved selfies by 2006 everyone knew that something was happening the New York Times published an article that year about how young people were suddenly taking a lot of photos of themselves was it weird what did it mean not once in the article is the word selfie used but it could have been because sometime between 1995 and 2006 the word selfie was born selfie with a Y had been a word since the 1600s it meant self-centered or selfish but selfie with an ie is new the earliest recorded usage of it is from a September 13 2002 post on Dr Carl's self-serve science Forum Australian Nathan hope uploaded an image he took of how busted up his lip had gotten and he wrote sorry about the focus it was a selfie hope has been hailed as the inventor of the word selfie but says himself that he probably heard it somewhere else first which is likely the word selfie is a hypocrism a pet name an affectionate familiar cuter version of an existing word Australians are famous for doing this barbecue Barbie mosquito mozzie Australian Aussie self-portrait selfie they don't only use I.E they love o s and Z too Australian English has given us probs Rando totes saws preggers and yes even doggo Myspace was an early incubator of thriving selfie colonies but in 2004 when Facebook launched as a serious social media platform for people at Elite universities there was a brief feeling that selfies were falling out of favor however when the iPhone 4 debuted with a front-facing camera in 2010 the selfie was declared officially back in 2013 usage of the word selfie had jumped 17 000 percent in the last year and Oxford dictionaries declared it the word of the year everyone knew what a selfie was we started calling things that existed before the word selfies as well but that is an anachronym a word used out of place in time anachronyms can be words that have lingered around too long like when we say we're dialing a number on a smartphone even though actual turning dials are no longer involved or when we call this tinfoil although it's actually the cheaper and more durable aluminum foil that superseded it anachronyms can also be words from today like selfie that barge back into the past like calling these medieval Church singers the first boy band nailing down the definition of a selfie in the modern sense is tricky of course does a selfie need to be a photograph if not why if so do I need to be holding the camera does the use of a timer or a drone I'm not even touching mean that it's not a selfie or just a different kind of selfie are humans a selfie since God made us in His image because of questions like that I prefer what I've been doing in this video just allow a selfie to mean anything that something has made that resembles itself or part of itself that covers a lot of stuff but can be broken down into four waves first wave selfies are unintentional the second wave began with the first deliberate depictions of oneself the third with photography's promise of recognizable self-depictions that were significantly more accessible the fourth wave is when selfies became a thing a cultural phenomenon motivated by a desire not just to have images but to be images throughout the 20th century especially we found ourselves increasingly surrounded by images news and travels and products and stories the entire world outside our head could be seen like never before not in person but through images in the midst of this image world was the human animal an organism that got to look at images but wasn't one which was too bad because to be an image was to be something well selfies gave us that power they put it in our own hands photography allows more of us than ever before to delay the third death but the fourth wave selfie flattens the boundaries of time and space now we can be anywhere whenever does my face need to be depicted for it to be a selfie well in October of 2013 Kim Kardashian posted this image on Instagram within a month belfie had been added to the Urban Dictionary a belfie is a selfie of your butt but selfie selfie belfie guides and histories and even a belfie stick soon followed and this all raises a serious question about Society if a selfie of your butt is called a belfie shouldn't a selfie of your face be called a filthy and as always thanks for watching [Music] let me show you something I've been working on it is a star projector it puts stars all over your bedroom and who doesn't love that me because it's always just the same stars I could see if I went outside that's why mine is different it shows the night sky not from Earth but as seen on trappist-1e an exoplanet that was one of the first targets of the new web telescope because it's very likely to be friendly to life whether or not anything lives there we don't know yet but what we do know is that it is the furthest known habitable exoplanet from which the naked human eye could still see our sun you can turn on this projector and see us just as others might alien others problem is the Curiosity box is a limited edition thing in the Box this comes in already sold out that's why it's important to join now we are now taking pre-orders for our winter box and for the holidays it's 50 off I won't spill too many beans but the winter box contains something that will help you if you have no choice don't miss our best deal of the Year get your first box for just 30

      "corpus": "All these ancient skulls have perfectly straight teeth, despite almost certainly never sporting braces. And this isn't some strange sample. According to the fossil record, ancient humans usually had straight teeth, complete with third molars\u2014 or wisdom teeth. In fact, the dental dilemmas that fuel the demand for braces and wisdom teeth extractions today appear to be recent developments. So what happened? While it\u2019s nearly impossible to know for sure, scientists have a hypothesis. A couple million years ago, the ancestors of modern humans lived a subsistence lifestyle. Their teeth and jaws had to work hard to make the food they ate digestible. Indeed, the surfaces of many of their  teeth show extensive wear and flattening. They also had larger jaws and teeth overall. At some point, they began using tools and fire to cook and prepare food, which helped break it down. A lot more time passed and, around 12,000 years ago, some humans started farming and domesticating animals and plants. Over the course of several thousand years, it became more common for people to process and refine their food. Milling technologies helped remove the tougher parts of grains, like the germ and bran from rice and wheat. Fast forward to the industrial Revolution, and technological innovations dramatically accelerated these processes. In a relatively short time, many human mouths were relieved of a great deal of their grinding, crushing,  and pulverizing duties. And interestingly, it was around this time that tooth crookedness appears to have become more common. Examining fossils spanning millions of years of evolution, researchers have observed a gradual decrease in tooth and jaw size in humans and our ancestors. Many think that,  for most of human history, dietary shifts\u2014 like the introduction of meat and the advent of cooking\u2014 were gradual, and that changes in tooth and jaw size basically kept pace with one another. But with the more recent revolutions in agricultural and culinary habits, that relationship changed. As the theory goes,  over a relatively short period, some human populations saw a decrease in jawbone size, while teeth stayed roughly the same size, meaning they're left vying for limited space. When they do grow in, they may displace others and get jostled into some eccentric positions. And then wisdom teeth, which are usually the last to make their debut, seem to only complicate things further. In many cases, they have little or no space to emerge. This can lead to impacted wisdom teeth, which may cause discomfort and infections if not surgically removed. So larger jaws appear to be associated with greater chewing demands. And many scientists think that as people's diets have become less chewy, their jaws have gotten smaller\u2014 and that this has led to dental crowding, resulting in dental crookedness and impacted wisdom teeth. This hypothesis has been supported by some preliminary experimental data. In a 1983 study, researchers raised 43 squirrel monkeys on diets of either naturally tough or artificially soft food. Those fed softer food had  more crowded premolars, rotated or displaced teeth,  and narrower dental arches. And a 2004 study similarly observed that hyraxes raised on cooked foods experienced roughly 10% less growth in facial areas involved in chewing compared to those given raw  and dried foods. In other words, the issue at large seems to be environmental\u2014 or one of lifestyle\u2014 instead of a genetic one, though heritable factors may be at play in some instances. It\u2019s estimated that somewhere  between 30 to 60% of people today experience some level of tooth crowding. But this trend varies  across global populations. Some people naturally  never have wisdom teeth. And some don\u2019t experience  tooth crowding or crookedness and still get their wisdom teeth without a hitch. This seems to coincide with diets that are less processed. So how can we prevent  tooth crowding early, using lifestyle changes and orthodontics? Well, it\u2019s certainly something to chew over."

      "corpus": "scientists have been studying our climate for decades and together we've reached a single inescapable conclusion greenhouse gases are driving up Earth's average temperature and unchecked that's going to make our planet a lot harder to live on climate change has brought and will continue to bring extreme environmental events that will be hard to prepare for experience and recover from with effects that will continue to layer Upon Our world's existing inequalities but there are things we can do each of us can do to help protect our planet ourselves and each other we can't change the past but together we can change the future and slow down and stop climate change in meaningful ways hi hi I'm M Jackson and this is the final episode of Crash Course climate and energy [Music] in 2015 countries around the world Forge the historic Paris agreement in it they committed to taking decisive action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep climate change in check for many countries that action became a pledge a pledge to reach Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050. that means they've agreed to reduce emissions by as much as possible and make up for whatever they can't eliminate by removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere the goal of these pledges is to limit how much the average global temperature goes up specifically to limit warming by the end of the century to less than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial Revolution levels and ideally to stop at 1.5 degrees that half a degree might not sound like much but science has shown that it makes a world of difference for instance in parts of southern Europe Central America and Australia which are already suffering occasional water shortages two degrees of warming would create intense and long-lasting droughts but when warming is kept to 1.5 degrees the situation is a lot less severe with some places experiencing half as many water shortages as in the worst case scenario and that's just one example everything from the vegetables you eat to the coral reefs you want to visit someday would have a better chance at survival with just 1.5 degrees of warming ultimately it translates to better food security and higher quality of life for millions of people and for all life here on planet Earth that said staying under 1.5 degrees of warming will be really really tough as a society we're super invested in burning fossil fuels for energy to the point where even an industry that seems unrelated on the surface like textile production releases roughly a billion tons of greenhouse gases every year so if we're going to keep our warming planet in check we're going to need to overhaul our ways of doing just about everything and soon as of the time we're posting this in 2023 we're on track for temperature rises between between two and three degrees Celsius unless we make a big and Rapid change so limiting ourselves to 1.5 degrees is nothing short of a Monumental challenge still if we take immediate steps to transform every major industry it is possible to get to Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050 and in so doing keep warming in check a policy making organization called The International Energy agency has even given us a road map full of possible milestones it involves things like stopping the sale of fossil fuel boilers to heat our water and homes by 2025 and stopping the sale of gasoline-powered cars by 2035. by 2040 the whole world would be running on electricity with net zero emissions and half of all buildings would have systems in place to operate without releasing greenhouse gases by 2045 we would be getting half of our heat from efficient low carbon heat pumps and finally by 2050 even manufacturing would be transformed with more than 90 percent of heavy industry like Machinery production and shipbuilding being considered low emission manufacturing processes are often especially hard to decarbonize so in addition to technological breakthroughs on the materials we use we would likely also rely on Technologies to capture the emissions released rather than letting them Escape in the atmosphere so say you're 15 years old watching this in 2023 if we stuck to a plan like this then by your 42nd birthday party you'd be living in a very different world imagine it there'd be no more coalfield power plants belching smoke over cities the phrase gas guzzler would also be a thing of the past because there'd be no more gasoline pumps instead you'd be rocking an electric hot rod Camry or hopping on public transit powered by carbon free electricity and in your home that same electricity would power all your devices from your phone charger to your robot Butler Greetings oh hey John greenbot thanks the incredible thing is this future it's not some sci-fi pipe dream well maybe you are John greenbot we've learned throughout this series that there are many carbon neutral technologies that exist right now in every sector they just need to be made affordable to take off but to make this Net Zero future a reality we'll also need some serious technological advances for example we already have options for generating carbon neutral electricity wind solar nuclear hydroelectricity and more but to use them to power the whole world we'll need big improvements in electricity storage and transmission so we can get power whenever we need it and wherever we need it and Technology won't be the only hurdle to overcome there are still a bunch of government policies subsidies and initiatives in effect that are designed to keep fossil fuels cheap they make various carbon-free options artificially expensive by comparison creating something called a green premium but if governments can thoughtfully reduce and eventually eliminate fossil fuel subsidies they can help make carbon-free energy more affordable and make technologies that emit greenhouse gases look less appealing the money governments are currently spending to make fossil fuels cheap could also be used to make carbon neutral energy cheaper or to research new emissions-free technologies ultimately though when it comes to getting to Net Zero every emission sector and every area of the world will need a different approach there's no one-size-fits-all strategy meanwhile the stakes keep getting higher so if you're feeling like all of this is overwhelming you're not alone government subsidies emerging Technologies many of the solutions to climate change might seem like they're happening on a level way above your head and the things you can do like Walker cycle make thoughtful purchasing decisions eat less meat vote all of these are awesome by the way but they can feel discouraging or maybe small it's hard to beat just one person trying to make a difference especially when you consider the impacts of what you can do versus the impacts of major corporations from 1965 to 2017 just 20 companies were responsible for a whopping 35 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions globally so where do people like you and me fit into that part of the story well companies governments and research centers developing new technologies they all have one thing in common they're made by people supported by people and can be changed by people and in a lot of big ways young people are leading this charge you've probably heard of Greta tunberg a Swedish environmental activist who has led School strikes and spoken at Global Climate conferences and while she might be the most famous she's far from the only young person to stand up for the climate at 18 years old Rwandan student Joseline irocose noticed piles of electronics thrown away in a local landfill so he invented an app that helps people figure out where they can recycle them locally at 12 years old emrati Canadian student kakashabasu started a company to get young people involved in local sustainability efforts and today she leads people in planting mangrove trees in Tidal habitats that have suffered deforestation at 16 years old Delaney Reynolds founded a program in Florida to educate youth in her community about the dangers of sea level rise and that's just to name a few examples of young people entrepreneurs Educators and activists have inspired people of all ages all over the globe to take action against climate change getting involved in climate change doesn't only mean making speeches staging strikes or going to marches whether you're into storytelling or gardening engineering or educating there's something there for all of us because whatever you're into and whatever you're up to climate change intersects with it way back in the first episode of the series we learned how climate change normally happens over centuries and Millennia throughout Earth's long history it's been a drawn out process driven by things like volcanoes and splitting continents but now driven by burning fossil fuels and greenhouse gases climate change is happening over decades over individual human lifetimes since climate is all about long-term patterns and things like rainfall and temperature climate change can be hard to point to it's everywhere all around us all the time and once you learn how the climate is changing and what's fueling it you can start to connect the dots see how it intersects with everything in your life climate change is the storm made more powerful by a warmer ocean the wiped out the lettuce crops a made your favorite salad more expensive it's the apartment complex being built down the street from cement and steel made by burning fossil fuels it's the late season snowfall that knocked out your power the fumes from a diesel-powered tractor and the lack of accessible public transportation in your town on the flip side climate change is also the electric pickup truck your neighbor just bought and the solar panels sparkling on those new apartment roofs and the falling cost of batteries and activists pitching their governments on policies that make heat pumps more affordable it's people and organizations coming together to try and slow the damage that's already been done to the climate and prevent things from getting worse so Engineers storytellers artists Farmers business owners students you name it we're all a part of the story of Earth's changing climate and once you learn what to look for you can see how climate change weaves throughout your entire life when you hear stories about people fighting against climate change it can sometimes sound like it's just one person standing up on their own facing down a whole government but almost always change happens because a group of people often from different backgrounds and walks of life team up for something they care about and there's a lot of people to team up with surveys have shown that the majority of people on Earth are concerned about climate change and are willing to do something about it at the end of the day it human creativity can put a plane in the sky an unthinkable magic trick at the time then human creativity like yours and mine can when joined together see us out of this mess I like to think of it like this we have 8 billion people on this planet that's eight billion people coming up with eight billion possible solutions forward climate change is everywhere and so too are the ways to solve and stop it this involves talking to community members designing new technologies passing new laws protecting natural spaces and caring for people and Landscapes most affected by our shifting world and of course there's a lot of learning involved too so hey thanks for being here for this series ultimately reducing emissions by 2050 will take a huge effort on the part of scientists governments corporations and individuals especially individuals banding together other as groups and communities sometimes that effort just looks like talking to each other about climate change helping one another see how it impacts Our Lives who we are our futures this can be enough to tip the first Domino to start a Cascade of hope that changes this generation the next one and all the ones to come special thanks to Claire Golding this episode's robot

      "corpus": "This metal is about as close to magic as it is possible to find in nature. I just don't get it. It can adjust its arrangement of atoms to return to some predefined shape, but it also converts between mechanical and thermal energy. And it can stretch up to 30 times more than an ordinary metal and still spring back to its original size. I can feel it in my hands shrinking back. Because of these unique properties, it's being used in everything from medical devices to toys, to bulletproof bike tires. And it's allowing NASA to reinvent the wheel for a space exploration. - This is the bones of the tire. - [Derek] The bones of the tire is a slinky. - So basically this is the slinky applied to the rim. - You just wrapped a slinky around a rim. - Yeah. It doesn't get any simpler than that, right? Here is a bicycle that has slinkies inside a polymer, if you look inside there. - [Derek] This tire does not require air pressure to work. The structure and shock absorption are all provided by that metal slinky. - [Jim] So that's like around a hundred psi or what a normal road bike would feel like. - [Derek] Yeah. Which means you should be able to puncture it with no loss of performance. So we're gonna drive it over a bed of nails, but first we'll test a traditional pneumatic tire just to make sure these nails are sharp. (tires popping) (upbeat music) - [Jim] Another puncture, another flat tire. - This one, kind of expected. So now I'm going to put these airless tires to the test driving over the same bed of nails. Here we go. (tires popping) I heard a lot of pops. I must have hit some nails. I don't feel anything different. (upbeat music) Still rides well. I'm gonna get up some speed. - [Jim] That's definitely a nail. - [Derek] I think the nail broke in it, why does it look like- - [Jim] That's what it looks like. - [Derek] Yeah the nail's in the tire. - We're now gonna try to shoot a bullet into the tire and see what happens. 3, 2, 1. (bullet firing) (upbeat music) - There it is. - There it is. - Whoo! - Look at that. (Derek chuckling) - [Derek] Wow. It's a really clean shot straight through. - [Jim] Yep, you can barely even see the mark on the tire. Looks like this one actually hit the- - [Derek] Alloy? - [Jim] Yep, it does to me. - [Derek] Yeah that's what it feels like. - [Jim] You can see we spliced off some of the bullet before we even got to the cardboard. - [Jim] How's the ride? - Yeah no problems. Bulletproof bicycle. This bulletproof bike tire actually comes out of NASA's research into making wheels for space missions. (upbeat music) It is really hard to make good wheels for other planets. I mean a lot of the places we wanna send rovers to, there is no or very low atmospheric pressure. - We can't use rubber pneumatic tires because of the extreme conditions on the moon and Mars there's no confining pressure outside of it. It can basically explode. - [Derek] Besides with temperatures dropping to extreme lows, rubber becomes brittle. - If this were a flagpole, the temperature facing the sun would be 250 degrees Fahrenheit above zero. In the shadow it's 250 degrees below zero. Let's put some rubber on the moon. - 90 is the glass transition temperature. It's when the polymer goes from being flexible to a rigid element. - [Derek] This is what happens when you dip rubber in liquid nitrogen. (rubber exploding) (bright music) (Jim chuckling) That's why you can't send rubber to the moon. This is why almost all the wheels used for exploring other planets have been made of hard metal. - This is actually a spare for the curiosity rover. They're made out of aluminum. A single billet that gets machined down so you don't have to worry about fasteners or welds or anything like that, that could potentially be a failure point. - But with it being so expensive to launch matter into space, the wheels have to be as lightweight as possible. It's lightish, but it's still heavy. - To meet those mass limitations they made the skin 0.7 millimeters thick thin. - Thinner than a credit card. - Yep, these structural members here, which we also call grousers, they're there to give the wheel strength, but also help grab onto obstacles and help grab the soil. The problem is that because this rubber is so large and heavy and the terrain is just so aggressive and nasty, they're actually seeing much higher peak loads kind of focused on areas between these grousers than what was predicted. This is the actual condition of the wheels on Mars right now. And as you can see, we've got big holes and cracks where that skin was. Now the wheel still operates, hasn't immobilized the rover. It's still gonna complete its mission, but it does affect where it can go and how efficient it is. - [Derek] When you apply a force to a material that is known as a stress. And what you're really doing is tugging on all the atoms inside the object, and as a result, their spacing changes a little bit and so the material deforms. For example, if you pull on an object, it will get slightly longer. And the per unit change in length is called strain. Now for most materials under low stresses, strain is directly proportional to the stress applied. And the more you stress it the more it stretches, and the material is elastic. If you remove the stress, the object goes back to its original size. So no atoms have moved around and no bonds have been broken or formed. You've just made them flex when you apply that stress. But if the stress applied exceeds the yield strength of the material, well then the strain is so great that the atoms can't maintain their positions relative to each other. Defects called edge dislocations can move through the material. The atoms are actually rearranging themselves, and so the deformation is not reversible. It's plastic deformation. So the object won't go back to its original shape when the stress is removed. If enough stress is applied, the material can completely fracture. In the worst case scenario, this results in holes like in the Mars rover wheels, which reduce their performance and ultimately could jeopardize the mission. Ordinary metals can withstand a strain of only around 0.3 to 0.8% elastically. Any more than that, and they undergo plastic deformation so they won't return to their original shape. Ultimately, they could even fracture. All right. - [Jim] Yeah and you kinked it too. - Kinked it and stretched it. And that's why every component of a space vehicle is designed never to stretch more than that 0.3 to 0.8%. But that's a significant limitation. There is a different type of wheel that NASA has tried in space, which are those on the Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle or LVR. - [Jim] That particular structure that they built is something that we call pantograph. All it is is a set of wires that have been over, under, over, under woven. - [Derek] And this on the surface here to get ripped also to strengthen? - It's primarily to ensure that the tire does not sink into the ground. So they did some studies with these tread strips to figure out how much coverage they needed. And so they found out that roughly 50% was enough to keep the tire kind of floating on the surface and still maintain that flexibility. - [Derek] The Lunar Roving Vehicle wheels worked well for the short distance journeys traveled on the moon. I mean the farthest this vehicle ever went was 36 kilometers, but still, these wheels needed to be designed to minimize plastic deformation of the steel mesh. - And so they put this internal structure inside there. We call it a bump stop. So as they hit a bump, and this is deformed, when it hits that it stops the deformation to keep it just below that proportional limit where they would induce plasticity. - [Derek] This wheel was good enough for the short Apollo missions, but for longer journeys a bump stop won't be enough to prevent plastic deformation building up over time. Mesh steel wheels have been tried on earth, but their performance does degrade over time. - This was the Mars steel spring tire we made and drove on that same test rig. And there's no fracture but you see a lot of permanent deformation there. - [Derek] What we need is a material that is strong and durable like steel, but which can endure much more strain without deforming permanently. And that is where this stuff comes in. In 1961, the Naval Ordnance Laboratory was doing experiments with different alloys involving nickel and titanium. A sample that had been repeatedly worked, heated and cooled was shown to one of the associate technical directors who just happened to be a pipe smoker. So he decided to see what the sample would do if he applied a bit of heat from his lighter. And when he did that, he found that the material changed shape. This shocked everyone and led to more investigations into the material. Which became known as nitinol, for its components nickel and titanium, and for the Naval Ordinance laboratory where it was discovered. So why did nitinol change shape? Well it's really because the alloy can undergo a phase change in the solid state. In heated nitinol the atoms are arranged in a cubic lattice arrangement, and this phase is known as austenite. But upon cooling, the atoms ease into a form known as twinned martensite. It's a messier lower symmetry arrangement of the atoms. And in this phase, you can apply stress to the material and deform it. But unlike in an ordinary metal, this deformation is not causing bonds between atoms to break and edge dislocations moving throughout the material. Now in this case, the crystal structure is changing once again to a detwinned form of martensite. And now when you heat it back up, the material goes from martensite back to being austenite. Which means all the atoms go back to their original locations, and so the material returns to its original shape. - We can basically set this shape as the parent known memory shape. That's why we call it shape memory. I can stretch this out. If I cooled it down I could stretch it out even more, but as soon as I heat it back up, it'll remember that original parent shape. - [Derek] And that's why nitinol is considered a shape memory alloy. The shape is set at high temperature when the material is in the austenite phase. Then as the material is cooled down, it undergoes a phase transition into twinned martensite. If stress is now applied to the material in this phase, it can be extensively deformed by changing the crystal structure into detwinned martensite. When the stress is released most of that deformation remains. But when the sample is heated, the atoms return to the austenite phase, which returns the material to its original shape. (Derek laughing) It's like you're barely in the water. - No. - And it just- - It's as fast as you can conduct heat to it or get heat away from it. - [Derek] Whoa, whoa. I mean that's cool. This is the property of nitinol that most people are aware of, and one that makes it useful for a lot of applications. So that's a stint. - They slightly cool these down right below to martensite, and then they crush it or elongate it. So you can see it gets real thin. And then they put in a catheter and that catheter goes through the body to the place where they wanna deploy the stent. And then upon deploying it, it bounces right back. Increasing that outer diameter and opening that artery. Nitinol is absolutely perfect for that. - [Derek] Shape memory alloys can actually generate significant forces when they're heated, which means they can also be used as actuators. - You're gonna see a huge amount of force and stress build up in the wire, which we can see here with how much it's pulling. - [Derek] Six pounds, seven, you can really see it contracting there. 13, 15, 16, 17, 20 pounds. Oh it's lifting it. That's about 90 newtons of force. Scientists have even used shape memory alloys to fracture a rock. Shape memory alloys are being investigated for use in aviation. I made a video before about vortex generators. Which are these little fins that stick up outta the wing of a plane to trip the airflow into turbulence. This is important for takeoff and landing to keep the flow attached to the wings so you don't stall. - But when you're up at cruise and you don't need those vortices being generated, you want these to stow because they're a drag penalty. As the plane just climbs from takeoff to cruise we go from some temperature on the ground to something close to -50, -60 C at cruise. The alloy is designed in between those so that we can just take advantage of the ambient temperature change that happens in the environment. When we cool this one down, no controller, no operator, it autonomously stays flat. - [Derek] The temperature at which the material transitions between austenite and martensite can be tuned to be anywhere between -150 to -350 degrees Celsius. This is done by changing the ratio of the elements and using different heat treatments. - [Santo] And then as that would heat back up coming into landing, it goes right back up. - [Derek] This principle has been extended to operate the main flaps on an aircraft. Now the heating and cooling is not passive, but controlled by a heating element. - So we've done demonstrations where you have a 737 aircraft and no hydraulic actuators on the wing box. All we have is a shuttle mechanism that's driven by two tubes in nitinol and we've driven those air arms and flap elements on the wing box of a 737 in flight, 60 degrees flap angle down, 30 degrees flap angle up just by heating and cooling two tubes of nitinol, replaces all the hydraulics. - [Derek] The shape memory effect is the main thing people know about materials like nitinol, but they have another unique property which makes them ideal for making durable wheels. - And you're just gonna take it and you're gonna loop it a couple times around your hand like that, and you're just gonna pull on that wire and feel 6 to 8% strain in a piece of metal. - Oh that's really weird. - [Santo] That's 6 to 8% strain, which you can't do in other wires, right? - But what's weird about it is that it feels a little crunchy. - [Santo] 'Cause you're feeling all of the reorientation. - [Derek] Oh so weird. - [Santo] So cool though, right? - [Derek] Yes, very cool. (nitinol pinging) Can you hear that? - [Emily] Yep. - [Derek] How weird is that? - [Santo] That pinging is 20. - [Derek] Shape memory alloys can stretch up to 8% of their length and still spring back to their original size. This property is known as super elasticity or pseudo elasticity, but they're kind of misnomers because the material is not actually operating in its elastic regime. What's actually happening is that this nitinol is in the austenite phase. It's transition temperature is lower than room temperature. But by applying a stress, even with no temperature change, you can force the crystal structure to change from austenite into detwinned martensite. And this rearrangement allows the nitinol to deform by that 8% and still it'll snap back to its original configuration once the stress is removed and the atoms return to the austenite phase. (nitinol pinging) That sound you're hearing is the material undergoing a stress-induced phase change in the solid state. If you wanna think about it on a stress strain curve. Now this transformation is occurring entirely above the martensite transition temperature. So the material starts off in the austenite phase, and then the applied stress is what induces the phase change from austenite to detwinned martensite. And when that stress is removed, the atoms spring back to the austenite phase, and so the material goes back to its original size and shape. - If this were a normal tube I would bend it to here and it would plasticize. If it was a brass tube, which you know has a plastic buckling mode, it would go like this and it would actually buckle a wall. I would never take my hands and bend them like this and have it completely returned to shape. - [Derek] At the bend the nitinol is transforming from austenite to martensite and back. - When we go from the higher symmetry phase, the austenite to the lower symmetry daughter phase, which one is it? Exothermic or endothermic? - I feel like that should be exothermic. - Good job science guy. (Derek and Santo laughing) If you were to put your hand around this tube, you'll actually feel the heat energy, the enthalpy of that transformation evolving as heat. You ready? - Yeah. Oh yeah that's real hot. - Ooh, ooh, ooh. That actually is like burning. Like I can't keep my hands on it. - [Santo] No keep your hand on it, it won't burn. - Geez that's hot. - When the stress is removed and the material goes back to being austenite, that phase change is endothermic. It absorbs heat. Woo. (Derek chuckling) Right? It's like you could use that for a refrigerator. - So it's exactly right. So another area where these materials are being applied is in a field called elastocalorics where we use this transformation to do things equivalent to heat pumping. - Like heat pumping. I wanna shoot this with our thermal camera. We got a FLIR with us. How's that? - This dissipation potential can act a little bit like the dissipation in the shock absorber, right? So the tire itself could actually perform some of that dissipation potential on its own. - It almost acts as a damper, right? To get rid of that energy loss. So then your tire actually has a potential of becoming a complete suspension system. - Hmm. - Which obviously really simplifies building vehicles for space. The original tire, when I put a load on it, okay you can see I'm only transferring a load from the footprint to this little section of the tire, all right? By tying this bump stop element to here, when I go through a footprint, you can see now I'm transferring load 360 degrees around the tire, right? By doing that, I have now increased my load carrying capacity significantly without adding any more mass. - [Derek] So to make a tire out of shape memory alloy, they weave nitinol springs together into a mesh. It's a pretty tedious and time consuming process. - [Engineer] So you're gonna take it like so. - [Derek] Yep. - [Engineer] You're gonna grab both ends? - [Derek] No. - [Engineer] And I'll take it. - [Derek] No you're not. - [Engineer] Take it. - [Derek] Yep. - [Engineer] And screw it in. - Oh my goodness. Are you kidding me? Is this what you do every day? - [Engineer] 684 Times. - [Derek] 684 times- - [Engineer] Per tire. - [Derek] But will these wheels work on rovers on the moon and Mars? Will they test the wheels extensively on a rotating carousel of different terrain types from sand to small rocks to bigger rocks? - So the terrain endurance rig basically consists of a circular carousel that is independently driven. The wheel tire assembly is also independently driven. So we can create a force slip condition, so we can drive with zero slip. (rover wheel whirring) And this is about how slow a Mars rover would be traveling. Average speed is about 6.7 centimeters per second. That's a nominal speed, they don't go too fast. - All right, I'm gonna go walk on simulated moon regular. It looks like beach and it feels like beach. This side is meant to simulate the surface of the moon, and this side is meant to be the surface of Mars. It is very sinky sand. The wheel is rolling along, rolling along, it's a rock. Am I pushing into it or do I wanna get it on top? - [Santo] I'd say get on top and just put all your body weight onto it. - That's basically my full weight on it. The shape memory alloy is strong enough to support the weight of a vehicle or vehicle and crew, but it's also incredibly flexible. So it can deform up to 8% without being permanently damaged. And that's what's needed for long space missions. - [Santo] So that's a pretty good amount of deformation, right? - [Derek] That's a great amount of deformation. - [Santo] And still not beyond 8%. - It's so gooey. Just walking back to the car after the beach. Tricky for a rover, right? But these tires won't just be for space. They're also looking at terrestrial applications. - Most aircraft, the tires on those aircraft, they have to be pressurized to really, really high pressurization, 300-400 psi. Not the conventional 30-60 psi you do in a car or truck tire, right? We have issues where at those huge pressurization they can explode. The other construct is maintenance, right? So if I'm a pneumatic tire and I'm relying on that pneumatics for the performance of the system, I have to always be checking the air pressure to make sure that I'm at the right inflation pressure so that I'm not burning too much fuel, or I'm not at a place where I could potentially pop a tire because of the loads. By going to a structural system that doesn't rely on air and is designed specifically for the application. All of those things go away. - They've tested one on a Jeep. Since it doesn't rely on pressurized air for support, you just can't get a flat tire. Plus it can never be under inflated, which significantly improves fuel economy. With a metal that works like magic, you can make airless tires that will take us off road, on road, into the air and across other worlds. (fire swooshing) (logo plopping) NASA's nitinol tires are designed to last the entire lifetime of a rover mission, even on a rough terrain of Mars. But here on earth, few products last a lifetime. From bike tires to phones to toothbrushes, pretty much everything wears out. But with Henson Shaving, the sponsor of this video, you may never need to buy another razor again in your life. Henson actually came out of an aerospace machine shop that built parts for the Mars rover and the ISS. So they are experts in precise high quality work. If the temperature to manufacture their rover parts changed as little as one degree, they had to scrap the entire piece. And that sort of precision is overlooked by most razor manufacturers. In a typical razor, the blades flex and bend when they make contact with the skin. And this movement causes micro cuts leading to skin irritation and razor bumps. To many people, this is just an inevitable part of shaving, but it doesn't need to be. You want advice about a good razor? Trust a guy with a beard. This is Henson's AL 13 razor. It's so precise that the blade extends past the shave plane by exactly 0.0013 inches. That's less than the width of a human hair. The blade is also securely fastened at exactly 30 degrees, leaving almost zero blade flex for a smoother and cleaner shave. This razor is designed to last a lifetime, and it's standard double-edged blades cost only around 10 cents each. Which means the cost of ownership for an AL 13 razor ends up lower than most cartridge or electric razors after only two years. And besides price considerations, having one razor for the rest of your life is both more convenient and better for the planet. So if you want one aerospace quality razor to last the rest of your life, go to hensonshaving.com/veritasium and enter code veritasium for 100 free blades with a purchase of a razor. That's two to four years worth of blades on me. Make sure to add both the razor and the blades to your cart for the code to take effect. So I wanna thank Henson Shaving for sponsoring this video, and I wanna thank you for watching."

      "corpus": "Putin is terrified for his life- this is the claim by a former FSB officer who has now defected to the west and brought startling intelligence with him that could shape the course of the Ukraine war. Since the war in Ukraine started, Russia has experienced a mass exodus of people from its country- most notably young, military age men. An estimated 1 million Russians- or around .6% of the total population, have fled the country since the start of Putin's disastrous invasion of Ukraine (Animator: insert real images of Russians fleeing here). This mass exodus has been disastrous for Russia's future, as many of the people who fled were entrepeneurs and those with technical skills. Russia's IT industry alone has experienced a catastrophic worker shortage, crippling the nation's future economy. However, lesser known to the public is a similar exodus from Russia's military. Since the war began, thousands of Russians have willingly surrendered- to the point that now the Russian military is threatening anyone who surrenders without cause with execution. While this is to be expected of the rank and file soldiers, many of which are conscripts who didn't choose to fight in the war, what's more surprising is the number of high ranking Russian defectors. A 3 star Russian general defected months into the war, his identity continues to remain a secret as he remains under the protection of NATO security services. Russia's Federal Security Bureau, its equivalent to the American CIA and sucessor to the KGB, has been rife with defections. According to one defector, the environment inside Russia's top spy agency in the wake of Putin's disastrous invasion has been one of quote- every man for himself. This is hardly surprising given what we learned early in the war, when Putin punished the FSB for its massive intelligence failure inside of Ukraine. Putin kept his invasion plan a secret from almost all of his government save for a select few officials. He did not include his security services in this plan, and instead tasked them with finding out what sort of reception the Russian army could expect from Ukrainians if there was to be an invasion, and how many would be willing to collaborate. According to unconfirmed reports, the FSB officers tasked with the assignment took the millions of rubles allocated to the mission and pocketed most of it for themselves, then simply fabricated glowing reports about Ukrainians greeting Russians with open arms. Based on this incredibly faulty information, Putin planned his invasion, and it's very likely that this was the direct cause for the catastrophic assault on Kyiv. One can hardly blame the FSB agents for pocketing the money allocated to their operation and simply inventing field reports. After all, talk of an invasion of Ukraine after the successful annexation of Crimea in 2014 was not uncommon, and as for the stealing of the money- well Russia's entire political, military, and intelligence system is built on corruption. What the FSB couldn't imagine was that Putin was serious, and while reports of the FSB's failure remain unconfirmed and likely will for years after the war, what is known is that senior FSB officers were put in prison shortly after the invasion. Others were placed under house arrest. The unraveling credibility of the FSB and Putin's growing anger as the invasion turned into a massive disaster led to a dog-eat-dog attitude within the spy agency, with agents more concerned with their personal survival- either professional or sometimes literally- than with accomplishing the mission at hand. Inevitably, this prompted many FSB officers to defect to the west, and to ensure they would receive a warm reception, they made sure to come with gifts. Vladimir Osechkin is an exiled human rights activist living in the west. While in Russia he worked as an investigative journalist and anti-corruption activist, making him an enemy of the state. Forced to flee, Osechkin now works to help others defect to the west- but on one condition: they must bring with them something to aid in taking down the Russian state. For military and intelligence officers, this means secret or at least sensitive intelligence. In 2011, Osechkin founded Gulagu.net to target corruption and torture inside of Russia. His agency has launched multiple investigations into various Russian institutions and government ministries, including taking on the nefarious Russian prison system. The Gulagu project has been exceeding expectations, not just in exposing secrets, but in bringing those secrets to light in the eyes of the people who matter most: other Russians. One group of FSB officers was so disgusted at Gulagu's discoveries that the men all turned whistleblowers. After the invasion of Ukraine though, Russians seeking the aid of Osechkin's organization to fleet to the west exploded in number. Most were ordinary Russians, from professional soldiers who no longer wanted to fight in a senseless war to conscripts forced to do so. However, some of the Russians seeking aid were far more important and valuable to western intelligence agencies- among them the previously mentioned 3-star general and even a government minister, both of which remain hidden away by NATO security services for their own protection. And the threat to their lives is very serious, as Russia is notorious for aggressively pursuing defectors and critics of the regime. Alexander Litvinenko, former officer in the KGB and later its sucessor the FSB, defected to the UK and brought with him bombshell allegations that Russia was targeting Russian critics abroad, as he was ordered to kill a Russian businessman and former Duma legislator, Boris Berezovsky. Berezovsky fled Russia after the election of Vladimir Putin and has been highly critical of the new Russian president ever since. In retaliation for his defection, Litvinenko was poisoned with polonium-210 in a cafe in London. The brash attack, which left radioactive contamination across the city as the assassins carried the polonium around, led to a diplomatic crisis between Russia and Great Britain. But Russia would not be deterred, and in 2018 carried out another brazen assassination attempt inside Britain. This time the assassination targeted Sergei Skripal and his daughter, a former Russian military intelligence officer and secret British double agent. Arrested in 2004 by Russia's FSB, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison but would be released in a spy swap in 2010. This time the tool of choice was a nerve agent sprayed via a dispenser, which would also poison a police officer who found the two unconcious. Luckily for all, they would survive albeit with lasting damage to their health. Sadly, the disguised perfume bottle used in the poisoning would be found in a trash can later by a man who gave it to his partner. When she sprayed it on her wrist she fell ill within minutes and died shortly after. Vladimir Osechkin would receive the same treatment from Russia, with at least two different attempts on his life. In one of the attempts, Osechkin spotted the tell-tale red laser of a weapon sight dancing across his dining room wall as he brought dinner plates to his seated children and wife. Ducking for cover, the Russian assassin instead fired on responding French police officers who maintain a constant watch on Osechkin. Since the war started and Osechkin has become more vocal against the Putin regime, the attempts have continued- though tip-offs have helped him avoid death more than once. On a recent incident a tip-off via text message simply read: \u201cVladimir, be careful. There has already been an offer for an advance payment to eliminate you.\u201d In exchange for his help, Osechkin received intelligence from the various arms of the Russian government, which he promptly passes along to NATO intelligence agencies. Recently, Osechkin helped former senior FSB lieutenant Emran Navruzbekov to defect, and in exchange received details on ongoing FSB intelligence operations inside of Europe. One of these operations was the identification of foreign fighters seeking to enter Ukraine to aid in the war, \u201cterrorists\u201d as Russia has called them. The ultimate goal is unknown, but it's possible Russia could have been looking to kill would-be volunteers before arriving in Ukraine in order to deter the flow of foreigners seeking to join the fight against Russia. One of the big revelations from Osechkin's growing list of defectors is the extent to which the FSB is involved in the politics of the Russian military. The agency has rooted itself deep in the Russian military, even to the point of directly influencing individual units. This has great political value for a regime built on blackmail and corruption, but is destructive for troop morale as well as unit cohesion. And a growing list of intelligence on the Russian military itself paints a very disturbing picture for Russia's armed forces. Since the start of the war it's become clear that the Russian military is not a single unified structure. Western militaries are single entities who unite their recruits under one banner and one doctrine. The United States for example has 50 states, but when a volunteer enters basic training and then joins an active military unit, they do so as part of a collective unified under one banner. This is not the case in Russia. Rather than unifying their military, Russia largely leaves it up to each individual republic to recruit, train, and often even equip their contribution to the larger Russian military. This has led to catastrophic problems with unit cohesion, morale, and standardization of both equipment and tactics. But disunity in the Russian armed forces is not a flaw, it's a feature. Inside of Ukraine there is not one Russian military fighting for control of the country, but multiple different entities generally fighting for the same goal. Of most prominent note is the regular army itself which consists of professional volunteers and professional volun-tolds, or conscripts, who make up the bulk of Russia's military power. However, private military companies make up a significant amount of Russia's on-the-ground forces, and like any private, for-profit enterprise, they are heavily discouraged from working cooperatively with each other or the Russian military. Chief amongst the PMCs inside Ukraine is the Wagner mercenary group and Patriot. One is owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin (use photo of him) and the other by Sergei Shoigu (use photo of him too), and although they both own mercenary groups, the two are worlds apart from each other. Wagner is a brute-force army that recruits from prisons, while Patriot is made up of Russia's most elite former soldiers- typically special operators and the like. While a Wagner recruit would be lucky to make a few hundred bucks a month, Patriot pays as much as $15,000 US a month for two-month contracts, making it high risk but very high reward for its members. Naturally, the two groups hate each other, even to the point of sabotage- the extent of which, revealed by Wagner and Russian government defectors, is shocking. There are strong reasons to suspect that Wagner purposefully leaks the location of political opponents to Ukrainian forces, who in turn target them for precision strikes. The internal war between the two factions, which has spilled out into the public sphere with Prigozhin continously attacking the ministry of defense, has likely done more to sabotage the Russian war effort than Ukraine could have hoped to with its own intelligence operations. And the rivalry has deadly battlefield consequences beyond sabotage- during the Battle for Vuhledar, which has become the largest tank battle of the war, neither of the three groups involved- Wagner, the Russian army, or Patriot- shared information with each other. This led to all three groups falling for the same Ukrainian ambushes time and time again. But Wagner defectors have also brought with them some horrifying stories about the group's violence against both civilians and itself, as well as the way it operates. One defector fled Russia with the help of a human rights organization by crossing the Russian-Norway border. He was recruited from a prison where he was serving a three year sentence, and having grown up on the streets, saw Wagner as his only real option in life. He detailed stories about lack of training and leadership. According to him, his unit did not receive training or instruction in how to carry out military operations on an objective. Instead, his unit was told to capture an objective and then left to figure out how on its own. This has been evident in the constant human wave attacks launched against Ukraine's defenses in Bakhmut, where the Ukrainian army has inflicted horrible losses on Wagner. The defector also detailed how Wagner keeps its troops in line. Wagner is no longer allowed to recruit from prisons- a move brought on by the fact that the Russian defense ministry is now doing it itself. In February a news story broke of the capture of Russian convicts who claimed it was the Russian Ministry of Defense who had taken over recruitment. One such recruit, Viktor Sevalnev, had been in jail for armed robbery and assault when he was sent to fight in Ukraine. He sent a message to his wife after surviving a fatal attempt to take an objective, saying, \u201cI am being taken to be shot. I lost a lot of people there. Remember this: do not send more people here. It's enough, they want to kill us all.\u201d His wife would never hear from him again, and days later was presented with his body. However, while prison recruitment was ongoing, Wagner had a distinct way of keeping them in line. Upon arriving in Ukraine, new recruits would be called into formation and then forced to watch as a would-be defector, or someone who had refused to obey orders, was executed in front of them. This was meant to instill fear and bring the consequences home: once in Ukraine, you do was you're told or you will be killed. And the methods of execution were famously gruesome- as Wagner has a reputation of using sledgehammers for the task. While involved in Syria, a video of Wagnerites crushing a Syrian man's legs, hands, and feet using a sledgehammer, all as the Russians laughed, went viral. The Syrian was eventually executed with a blow to the head. Now Russian Wagner recruits are facing the same consequences for retreating or disobeying a direct order. But that's only for those who manage to survive the use of blocking forces by both Wagner and the Russian military. A tactic pulled straight out of the World War II Soviet play book, Russia is so desperate to avoid losing more ground on the battlefield that it has taken to the use of blocking forces- units set directly to the rear of an assault, with orders to kill anyone who retreats from the assault wave. This is again, not surprising, given that Russian defectors have also brought news of how conscripts and even professional soldiers have been getting creative about not following orders. A common practice amongst units is to simply fake contact with Ukrainian forces, firing their weapons at nothing while calling in a contact report over the radio. Others however have taken to more creative approaches, such as sabotaging their own equipment and even vehicles, or simply dumping fuel. The practice was very popular at the height of the Ukrainian counter-offensive. Brutal punishments for sabotage have been introduced, but some soldiers still risk the punishment over heading to almost certain death. But it's been the flow of well-placed or high ranking Russian defectors that has been an intelligence gold mine for the west. Often these individuals might not even be aware of the value of the intelligence that they bring, or have nothing specific to bring with them. But even the smallest details can open up a window into the shadow workings of the Kremlin. One former FSB doctor defected to the west and brought with her medical records and taped conversations with senior officials. Her medical records documented how a Russian military intelligence officer had been diagnosed with malaria, allowing her western handler to identify an ongoing secret operation in Africa. Her taped conversations detailed how Chechen officials are being largely given judicial impunity inside of Russia itself- something which would surely anger most Russians to hear. However, Putin is desperate to keep Chechnya under control, given its two disastrous wars against the rebellious province in the last thirty years. Other taped conversations, secretly recorded on her cell phone, revealed government officials secretly discussing the ongoing collapse of the Russian armed forces- giving a direct insight into just how long Russia may or may not be able to continue fighting in Ukraine. However, one recent defector has given the west a unique view directly into the life of Vladimir Putin himself, painting a portrait of a deeply disturbed dictator with a very loose grasp on what's really going on in his own military. Gleb Karakulov was an FSO communications officer who worked directly alongside Putin on foreign trips for years. His job was to set up secure communications for the traveling president in order to keep him in contact with his own government and military. However, after seeing how the war in Ukraine started to play out, and perhaps sensing big troubles ahead for Russia, Karakulov decided it was time to flee. Karakulov stated that after the invasion of Ukraine he changed his plans- originally he'd planned to serve his time in the FSO, the Russian equivalent of the American Secret Service, and retire. However, his conscience got the better of him as reports of Russian atrocities poured in, and in his own words, he could no longer serve a war criminal. Shortly after the start of the war, Karakulov says that he took three months of sick leave as he came to grips with the ongoing war. That was when he started making plans to flee Russia, but his passport had expired and it would take time to renew it. Meanwhile he was forced to continue his job as a communications specialist. While working he sat in on discussions amongst other senior officers discussing the war and savoring the atrocities being committed. Karakulov says he was disgusted, but while he could terminate his contract, when the mobilization began he realized he could just end up being mobilized and sent to the front, so he decided to remain in the FSO. Then he discovered that he'd been assigned to a trip to Astana in Kazakhstan, and he knew it would be his only chance to make an escape. On October 6th, ahead of a visit by Putin, Karakulov and his team were sent to Kazakhstan to prepare the location for his arrival. Karakulov\u2019s wife and daughter remained behind in Moscow for three days, and then joined him in Kazakhstan. In order to avoid raising suspicion, she stayed at a different hotel and the two only contacted each other once before making their getaway. Karakulov kept postponing the escape attempt as complicating factors kept popping up- but then on the morning of October 14th he was told he would need to hand in his external passport, as the team was due to return home the next day. Time was up, Karakulov couldn't wait any longer. When the day of their escape came, he sent his wife to his hotel to grab his suitcase, as it would be suspicious for him to be seen departing his hotel with a suitcase. Claiming that he was going to go souvenir shopping, Karakulov excused himself from his team, and at 3pm he and his wife fled to the airport. However, their flight was delayed and Karakulov's phone was blowing up with text messages from his team asking where he was. He delayed suspicion by claiming he was feeling sick, but as the minutes dragged on it was becoming more and more obvious that Karakulov was defecting. Finally, they were able to board the flight for Instanbul, and upon landing Karakulov turned on his phone to see text messages from very angry agents. But at last he was safe, and free to tell the world what he knew about Putin. According to Karakulov, Putin has placed his yes men well, and his bosses in the FSO, quote- worshipped Putin. Nobody dares criticize him and he is referred to as \u201cthe Boss\u201d by all senior officers. However, Putin's yes-men are also his only source of information. According to Karakulov, Putin doesn't travel with a mobile phone nor use the internet at all. The Russian dictator lives in a complete information vacuum, relying only on his intelligence reports and, perhaps unsurprisingly, Russian propaganda for his information. In another report, Karakulov said that Putin demands that Russian television be made available no matter where he goes. This lines up perfectly with what the west has theorized about the Russian dictator. Shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, it became clear just how bad the Russian military was at its job. Poor tactics, even worst doctrine, and equipment in horrible states of disrepair. Multimillion dollar aircraft were falling out of the sky due to lack of maintenance, and the Russian military was wholly incapable of integrated operations between its various branches, even down to the unit level. Only an absolute madman would have sent such a force to invade Ukraine- or one who lived in an information vacuum where the only reports were those shaped by his closest yes-men. And like in any dictatorship, nobody wants to tell the boss something bad, so the Russian military's deficiencies were never made known to Putin. However, Russia is such a deeply corrupt state that it's almost certaint even Putin's closest confidants were themselves unaware of just how bad things were. Trickle down economics may be a Reagan myth, but trickle down corruption is very real, and when you create an entire culture of corruption at the very top, it's bound to roll downhill to the individual unit level. Thus the only people who truly knew what terrible shape the Russian armed forces were in, were thoses on the lowest rung of the totem pole- and they weren't about to tell their bosses the truth. Such a culture almost always leads to the downfall of nations, and destroys militaries from the inside out. Putin's information vacuum dooms any chance at reform, and spells disaster for Russia's continued war in Ukraine. However, Karakulov also gives us insight into Putin's mental state. According to the former security services officer, Putin lives in a state of paranoia, fearful for his life. For years he has kept mostly to his private residences, which the Russian public jokingly calls his 'bunkers'. However, there may be more truth to this than you think, as a paranoid Putin apparently demanded secure communications be wired into an actual bunker during a trip to Kazakhstan. It's long been theorized that Putin is afraid of getting Covid, and that's why he makes everyone stand so far away from him during official meetings. However, Karakulov paints a picture of a man who has been terrified of assassins for years, and given the state of Russian politics, this is hardly surprising. Unfortunately for the world though, Karakulov also says that Putin appears to be in excellent health despite his age. So there doesn\u2019t seem to be any hope of him croaking anytime soon. In 13 years, Karakulov says that only two trips were canceled due to him being ill. The topic of Putin's personal life is a mysterious one, including his direct family. It's known that he has children, but Karakulov says that not much is known about them aside from the fact that his daughters have security personnel assigned to them. He was unable to offer any insight into how often Putin sees his children, if ever at all. However, rumors of Putin owning lavish homes are true, as confirmed by one of Karakulov's colleagues who regularly goes to a lavish palacial mansion owned by Putin in order to test communications. He also confirmed that Putin owned the Scheherazade yacht, news of which broke after the invasion of Ukraine. Karakulov also revealed that a paranoid Putin started to prefer traveling in special trains disguised as regular trains sometime in 2014. This was so he could avoid traveling by plane, as they could be easily tracked. It's much more difficult to find out the origin of a train- especially when it's been camouflaged to secretly hold the leader of Russia. In order to confuse foreign intelligence and prevent attempts on his life, Putin also frequently faked leaving for travel via plane. His security services would stage an elaborate show of getting the President to his plane, only to have it take off with no one on board. A fan of boats though, Putin also has secure communications installed onto several vessels, each lavishly decorated- though Karakulov believes that only some of these are on the official government balance sheet, helping confirm rumors of Putin's vast wealth, nearly all of which was stolen from the Russian people. Karakulov remains under the protection of NATO intelligence, with his exact location a closely guarded secret. While his insights into Putin are greatly illuminating, Karakulov's value to NATO is also in his detailed knowledge of Russian secure communications equipment and practices, making him one more in a growing list of very high value defectors.

      "corpus": "oh this is such a hard conversation this is the story of put it up as the host I feel like a lot of people have been waiting for this story and the first thing I want to say is there is no bad blood between Nate Callie myself Mark Hunter anyone that used to be involved with the t-core team you know we're all creators we support one another we are on this journey together and we have a special bond there so to start this story we need to go back to 2020. I was in Utah for spring break my family was snowboarding in Park City and I remember being in Utah and I was like I love it here and I sent a prayer up to God and was like God if you have the power and the will to bring you back to Utah I would love that I love the nature of the outdoors everything about it it literally set my heart on fire being there when I said that prayer I never expected that I would actually end up back in Utah so I'm doing College online at NC State and I get this really weird Instagram DM and it's from this production company and they're like hey we would love we have this thing going on with this YouTube channel they're doing some casting we would love to do a screen test with you and normally like I've gotten plenty of these messages before I never responded to any of them because they're always kind of a scam or they're weird or they're fishy or they're just someone trying to get your money but I felt like this intense pull from the deepest hit of my body and was like yes answer to this like this is next for you and so I was like okay so I responded back and next thing I knew I was flying to Utah to go film with these people that I had no idea I'd never heard of a YouTube channel I had never experienced it all I knew is that I loved science I wanted to communicate science and I wanted to set people's Souls on fire that's all I wanted to ever do in my life if I can Inspire just one person to follow their intuition to follow their gut to follow their love that's all I could ever want that's why I do this I don't do it because I want to be famous or I want to be a YouTube tuber I literally do it because I'm here to light your soul on fire to inspire you to answer your curious questions to make you feel capable that's my goal with t core that is what I plan to do at this point I still haven't met anyone I have talked to Nate over email and he told us how a video is put together and how to come up with ideas because we were to show up with ideas and that was daunting because I had never thought of being a YouTuber I didn't think I was a creative person I still don't think I'm a creative person every day I'm in this imposter syndrome right of am I good enough to be doing what I'm doing every day every day and I remember going into the basement and meeting Nate and Callie for the first time and it was awesome they were so kind I was there with Kevin and Nate and Callie were great they were so sweet they talked about how a video is made we all just kind of got to get to know each other and it was awesome so we were supposed to be there for two weeks we ended up staying there for two months filming videos creating content and it was all about just kind of how a video is made and back then our videos didn't have Direction it was very much here's an idea what is something unique that it can do or what is something that we can do to it to make it explode do something or make it engaging and it was very much just kind of like we're gonna do this thing and see what happens and it was repetitive it was over and over and there was there was no plan really going into a video and so I was never actually taught how to YouTube like literally I was my first video was the aloe vera video and I was with Nate and Callie obviously and I was just told like hey know a couple facts about aloe and then we're gonna play with this weird thing put it in the freezer and see what happens and it was great like that's what was working at the time we're filming all these videos and creating content at this point we were a Content Farm I'll own it I will say it we were just pumping out videos for revenue and that wasn't working anymore it was all about content and how you make a video and planning and so when we were like this is not working anymore our views are rapidly declining it's not feasible for us to film two and three videos in a day because we were filming when we were filming a video it was two or three videos in a day I cannot even fathom how we did that like it it physically makes me sick like I don't I have mad respect for Nate and Callie because I don't know how for two years they filmed that many videos every single day and it was it literally like makes me physically sick to even think about that now so a couple months go by and then we are sent home um and they're like we're gonna do some testing see if the audience likes you guys if they do we'll bring you back blah blah blah well you guys did not take to Kevin Kennan and myself kindly I did not receive nice messages and little did I know this was only the tip of the iceberg um you guys didn't like me specifically you really didn't like me and that was hard because I was just out here trying to share a love of science with the world and share it with you and things that I found interesting and I was basically like beat over the head about how I was just this bimbo essentially and it was hard it was really hard I'm not gonna act like it was all fun and games because it was hard to read comments about yourself over and over and over again that just beat you down God basically helped me get to where I was he was like you asked for it here it is little did I know that God was going to look at me and be like you asked for it really here it is I officially moved to Utah and this is when the curtain very much was pulled back for me you know how they're like everything is great on the outside until you really see the inside well that's what happened here the frustrating piece of all of this is we were constantly told just make better content so we have this idea like let's make a couple videos a month and increase the quality and we were trying to do anything we could at this point to try to get things back on track because we knew we had a legacy to support and that Legacy is Grant's Legacy and we wanted to continue that Legacy and allow people to still feel the energy that they had felt with Grant and you know I think it's so funny because I look back at videos of when I first joined T core and people were like you have way too much energy you have way too much happiness like you were way too bubbly and like that's who I was and the the sad part is is I I actually listen to those people I listen to those people and I tried to contain myself and put myself in a box and not be as excited but the things that you were getting were genuine I wasn't fake a lot of people were like she's so fake blah blah blah like no that's just me that's literally me with these videos that we were making and producing the higher quality videos um versus these filming two or three videos in a day I actually graduated college from when we did the liquid oxygen explosion house I I literally graduated from college that day and I think that's a memory that I'm forever going to have and it was a really fun video to be completely honest with you something I never thought I would ever experience uh and so that's when you get like the glow-in-the-dark Tesla videos we have the giant chocolate video we have oh and the giant human catapult that was a crazy video from that time that took way longer and was like a 5 000 plus dollar project film for you guys it was insane I I loved it it was it was amazing so things at this point still aren't really working out for us with t chord the views are still falling everything is kind of in shambles and it's hard it's hard I mean I was I was hopeful and I thought saw the positivity that could be but it was just not a really positive environment and I think that's really hard is when behind the curtain things aren't as happy and positive as you thought they were and every day I felt like I had to go and be this positive light for everyone and be it this giant happy ball of energy and that was truly me but when you don't have people pouring into you and you are basically giving all that you have eventually your bucket becomes empty and you can literally like there were videos where my spark was gone and you all notice that you commented like hey are you okay like like what's going on here like you guys started to notice it and that for me was really sad so fast forward to January of 2021 I got a call from Mark and Mark had told me that he was let go and then I called Nate after and I cried on the phone I cried because I realized that t core was now in my hands like it was now mine to hold um and that was a really big and scary responsibility because I remember Mark calling and letting me know like he was let go and I remember thinking like well who's gonna film our videos and so Josh and I talked and Josh is the one who you guys see in the videos all the time now and if you listen to the podcast he hosts a podcast with me and we were like what do we do how am I supposed to run and carry the legacy of a YouTube channel with 12.5 million subscribers when I don't even know how to write a YouTube video I don't know how to produce a YouTube video I don't know what to do like I don't know I don't know YouTube this is not what I had planned for my life and like what I thought I was going to do and that's okay and so when I took over the channel I obviously knew there was going to be backlash I obviously knew like I was sick to my stomach I could not eat because I knew the backlash that I would get I talked to Nate on the regular just to like ask questions and to like check in and like there's no hard feelings between us like it's it's very calm and professional and there's no hate towards one another at all to be very clear I admire Nate for carrying on the legacy of grant for as long as he had basically before Nate had been let go from T Corp my boyfriend had taken a job in New York and then Camille who was um basically in charge of production had decided she was going to go back to school and go to med school which I applaud her with my whole heart because it's something that she's passionate about so I was losing all these people in my life like I I was living in the t-core house I lived in the t-core house and so people would always be coming to work and then all of a sudden like all these people were gone from my life like my boyfriend had moved Camille had moved Nate and Callie and Mark were no longer coming to the studio and it was it was just me there me Josh and Ray and it was quiet it was Eerie it was uncomfortable and I slowly started falling very deeply into a depressed state I moved to New York because I was utterly depressed and alone in Utah um and no one really knew that or saw that besides my family and it's really hard for me to talk about and it's really hard for me to talk about to be because to be completely honest with you guys I was done I was done I didn't want to do this anymore I couldn't take the mean comments the mean things that people were saying about me and it was really hard like there were days I just sat and cried because of the mean things that people said in my DMs and like my personal DMS not even on t-core stuff like on my personal page and all I've ever been doing and trying to do is carry this Legacy and to support this community and to allow you guys to continue to discover the unknown for us to do science together for us to just be a community to strengthen you all to give you videos to provide you with information about the world and so when I moved I made a promise to myself and that was to find joy and happiness again because I've been depressed for a really long time a really long time and it took me coming out here to New York and being with my boyfriend and surrounding myself with love to finally be okay again I traveled halfway to the moon for you all last year between living here in New York and traveling back to Utah for two weeks at a time like it took a toll on me and it's so hard for me when people are like making comments about who I am or like what the videos are it just hurts because we put so much love into this I traveled and literally broke my back to give you all videos last year and to also take care of my mental health so in 2023 I made a promise that I was going to be a truthful vulnerable and honest with our community so what that means for our community is that I'm going to be doing a lot of traveling this year and not just traveling back to Utah for us to film videos but traveling the world and bringing you guys worldly content of cool things happening around us and I I want to do that because that's who I am that's what brings me joy that's what sparks my curiosity is exploring things so I will be going to Iceland this year Mexico I'm really excited about what this new chapter of T core is going to bring all of us because it's answering questions discovering the unknown and taking a step outside the the basement into the real world into life discovering science in real life and I'm excited about that because science for me exists outside of a textbook it's it's not all about what you learned but what you experience and that's what sticks with you forever so I hope you guys want to come on this journey and you're excited about this new chapter of tunecore if you are give a good old comment of Yeehaw and if you have been around since I've been on the channel you know what Yeehaw is and what it means thanks for hearing me out and thank you for being a part of our t-core community it means more to me and our team which is Josh me and Bryce and Janae is the owner if you have questions drop them in the comments below I'd love to talk to you guys more about tquore where we're going what we're doing and what questions you may have for me regarding my journey with t core I wouldn't change a second of it I'm so grateful for our community our exploration together and the things that we're all doing together become better cooler more happy individuals while discovering the world around us so I hope you stick around and I hope you're excited about the direction of T core and what's going to be happening because I'm not going anywhere anytime soon so you're stuck with me whether you want to or not unsubscribe if you don't but if you like it stay subscribed because we got some awesome adventures ahead of us go ahead comment down below but keep it positive because here on this channel we are positive loving kind Community where we lift up one another and support one another until the next one stay random and keep discovering new things"

      "corpus": "Stelfie is a very funny  and very clumsy dude.  He time travels and has  the most incredible adventures. And he is sort of  an alter ego myself although physically we are  completely different. Originally I started this project as a way to showcase the potential  of Stable Diffusion combined with good artist skills. My goal was to capture a scene where Stelfie engages in a boxing match  with Muhammad Ali. I always start with, you know,  drawing a sketch. Stable Diffusion and the other  diffusion models around are extremely good, but also  extremely cheeky. It's very easy for them to  drive you away from the original idea  that you had. Once I have the idea, I want to try  a bunch of random prompts... just to see if I can find at least a good initial pose. I couldn't find the pose  for Stelfie on the right. So, what I've done is that  I moved to Photoshop... and I recreate the pose myself. ControlNet an extension if I had to reproduce today  the same pose that... I've done two months ago  with this artwork... probably would take me  15 minutes. Throughout the whole process I always use different samplers. Because the sampler is very important in terms of realism and details. So if you're trying to  replicate skin... Euler is very synthetic,  is very fake. But DPM, for example, is  working great on that. There are many parameters that are  extremely important. One is steps. So steps is how many times  you\u2019re telling Stable Diffusion to work on your prompt. You can choose a very low number  or a very high number. Many options.  At the beginning, obviously, the two more important parts are the the inpaint and the outpaint. So inpaint means you are asking the machine to change just the parts of the image and the machine will change only the part that you want it  to be changed. On the other side, outpaint,  you\u2019re asking to the machine... to imagine what's outside the box based on what is already in the box. As you can see, I look back  a lot between  Stable Diffusion and Photoshop. So let's say that's out of 100%. 50% is done with Stable Diffusion about 40% in Photoshop and about 10% in Procreate. When it comes to Stelfie\u2019s face... I use a model that has been trained  specifically on Stelfie\u2019s face. So what I've done previously is that  I created Stelfie in 3D... and I took a bunch of snapshots... of his face from different angles... and I use those images  to train the model. So when you train the model you save a keyword. The noise strength is the last option that you can see in the web UI  of Stable Diffusion. And why is important? Because it gives you more or less control... on the image itself. When it comes to faces,  it\u2019s very difficult to achieve... good results. Especially if you're trying to  replicate a popular person. So I've asked Stable Diffusion to make a face that would  look like Muhammad Ali. And then in Photoshop,  I warped all these traits. So I make the nose \u2014 I don't know,  larger or thinner. And the jaw... the eyes. So, I changed everything manually. But what is important now  is to try to have the pose that is correct. And I wanted to\u2014 I wanted Stelfie to be like  a bit fluffy in terms of not super fit, without a six pack. And probably here I sort of found... the belly that I was happy with. But clearly it was not realistic enough yet. And then I used the result and I modified the result in Photoshop. But my understanding of how Muhammad Ali  was looking like. So you have to, you know and crop and cut and paste and  change and warp and paint on top, arms and eyes,  exposure, skin tone so a lot a lot of stuff. So here I was about halfway done. But then eventually, if you're  running into trouble... even if you're not super precise... you can, you know, go back in  the Stable Diffusion and try to ask Stable Diffusion  to help here. You, you know, just maybe on  some part of some edges or with the lighting or  with the skin. This sort of... stuff. Still the the body of Muhammad Ali  is not correct. He wasn't buff like  the athletes are today. You know, he was big  and healthy. But not  like this muscle  that they have today. Very defined. And so I wanted to get that real... realistic Muhammad Ali. Here we are in a good position because probably we are  12 or 14 hours in. And as you can see, the scene is set. So it's all good to go. You just need to make it better. Well here\u2014 Probably they don't like nipples,  who knows. The nipples period of Stelfie. You know, before December which is when Stelfie was born... I was going to bed and there was dreaming about beautiful ladies. Now all that I dream about  is about 41 years old dude. So, no. Not great.  Not great. Well, I feel you have to drive the machine not the other way around. And just to prove how important  is the artist\u2019s part in the overall  process creation. I see the overall process as a joint effort with the AI. I\u2019ve been a traditional artist for 2 decades, painting on canvas. And in the last five years I've been doing a lot of digital art. So from that part of myself,  I don't feel threatened at all. I feel this is an opportunity. An opportunity for many  new talented people... to jump on a new branch of art that is completely different from the one that we have already  in digital art and just open up new way  of being creative. 50% of the hands that you see  in Stelfies are mine. And that's because it has always been extremely challenging to  reproduce hands. So what I was doing is that, you know,  if I needed the hand in some position I would take a picture of my hand... and then I would clean it up  and paste on top."

conveyor belts oh I'm going to pretend to be a construction worker but first things first Safety First I'll put on my hat and my safety vest will you pretend to be a construction worker with me great come on I'm at my first construction vehicle can you guess what it is I'll give you some hints it has two arms and a bucket it's a front loader okay let's see how it works oh start engine smart Wow Let's honk the horn [Applause] excuse me moving dirt here to put it in fries now reverse backing up pardon me oh gotta turn on my lights check out these petals this is so cool [Music] [Applause] hey let's park oh that was awesome oh and look at these big tires black and yellow one of my favorite colors oh let's see what this does spin spin spin whoa so cool cool we can roll it around this is a big circle easier for rolling and these are called treads they help the wheel get traction and check this out over here [Music] wow it's like a construction site and there are three construction vehicles red green and blue oh and it's a puzzle the goal is to get each car to its site this one is for the blue car okay let's see if we can get it over hmm best way to get there excuse me red oh I have to go up there excuse me red you go down there da good okay let's try for red which way will we go huh no that's not the right way we made it okay one more vehicle to go oh we match we met oh awesome oh check it out I see something cool over there let's go whoa check out this building it's pretty tall oh and it has a lot of great shapes do you know what this shape is that's right a triangle in this shape Circle great job put this triangle on top make sure everything's nice and tight hey let's use this pipe wrench to make sure everything is packed [Music] nice and tight [Music] great have another wrench in my jam pack this one's called a crescent wrench because of the shape on top it kind of looks like a moon in the sky okay let's take our tools and see what needs fixing over here whoa check out these big blue buildings behind me so tall hey let's make an End together oh and look out of the perfect shape for that don't they look like rainbow arches yeah okay so now I have a second rainbow arch hey wow mm for Mika job well done okay our project is constructed and finished on to the next one we made it to the cement truck mix it up mix mix it up mix it up mix mix it up [Music] oh whoa hey this looks like a hamster wheel that's a wheel that little hamsters and other animals use to run around and get their exercise in but in construction this wheel is used to mix cement it turns it around and around and around mixing it all together should we try it should we be cement that gets mixed and mixed and mixed together [Music] let's give it a try [Music] that made me a little dizzy spin spin spin like a cement Chuck spin spin spin like a cement Chuck I saw a lot more cool things to do here while I was spinning come on let's go learn more about construction vehicles [Music] we made it to our next construction vehicle can you guess what it is I'll give you some Clues it has an arm and a boom and a bucket that's right it's an excavator excavators are used to dig things up sometimes it's dirt but this excavator digs up balls okay we have to stay out of the construction zone okay oh here it goes hey awesome let's try it again [Music] oh [Music] that was so much fun we dug up a lot our job here is done okay let's go [Music] foreign look it's a conveyor belt a conveyor belt helps construction workers move things from one spot to another so that they don't have to carry them oh great oh and look check it out look at all these bricks [Music] they're rectangular see the shade and do you know this color yeah Brown oh and there's another shape too can you see it right girls let's count the circles one two three great job this kind of reminds me of chocolate let's pretend that these are chocolate pieces and we want to move them way up there come on let's check it out okay let's put them on the conveyor belt hmm great ready little chocolates turn turn turn whoa wow I have to keep turning have to keep turning whoa let's get them all the way to the top there they go yeah okay now we're at the top at the bottom we put the chocolate bricks onto the conveyor belt and we turn the wheel turn the wheel turn the wheel until they went all the way to the top and look this is where they landed more bricks are coming check it out oh that is so cool okay now I'm ready to go down the slide I'll see you at the bottom [Music] yeah that was so much fun whoa what's this hmm kind of looks like a bucket oh check it out when I pull this one down that one goes higher oh it's a pulley system it helps get things from one place to another just like a conveyor belt does maybe I can send my friend some lunch at the top but since I don't have lunch let's see what I have in my jam pack oh look a little construction vehicle let's put it in the bucket and send it up ready here you go oh so cool let's put something in this bucket too see what I have in my jam pack a tiger are you ready ready in you go have fun wow now the tiger is going up high and now it's coming down low now it's going up high and look our construction vehicle is on the other side wow being a construction worker is a lot of fun okay let's drive away wow a tractor race since I'm all done with my construction work let's go on a tractor ride [Applause] whoa whoa whoa in the big tractor go go go I'm a big tractor beep beep backing it up [Music] whoa that was so much fun thank you so much for being a construction worker with me today we wrote a big front loader and we pretended to be submit mixing around in a cement mixer then we use the little excavator to dig up a ball pit oh whoa we did a lot today now it's time to hang up my vest and roll on out of here well that's the end of this video but if you want to watch more of my videos all you have to do is search for my name

Some mice have crummy immune systems. Like, especially the ones we rely\u00a0 on to learn about our own health. When they\u2019re bred in sterile environments\u00a0 and cut off from the real world, how is that supposed to teach us anything about real humans in the real world? But some researchers argue that\u00a0 wild mice can bridge that gap. A wild mouse\u2019s immune system\u00a0 has way more in common with our own than those of lab mice do. And I\u2019m about to tell you why it could be a huge game changer in modern medicine. [INTRO] More research is conducted in\u00a0 lab mice than any other animal. And that\u2019s because scientists\u00a0 know what they\u2019re getting into when they study lab mice,\u00a0 from their genetic makeup to what in the environment\u00a0 is likely to throw them off. But over years of mice being optimized\u00a0 for answering research questions rather than for maintaining their own health, the poor little guys have become really inbred. To keep their genomes totally uniform, researchers may breed the same animals with their siblings for 27 generations at a time. And researchers like it that\u00a0 way, because it means they\u2019re less likely to accidentally attribute an experimental outcome to the wrong source. For example, if you feel funny after\u00a0 eating a peanut butter sandwich, it could have been because\u00a0 you developed a nut allergy, or it could have been the sushi\u00a0 you ate earlier in the day. Or it could have been the medication\u00a0 you took with the sandwich, or any number of factors\u00a0 that you might not be able to narrow down because you\u2019re exposed\u00a0 to so many new things every day. But the lab mouse eats the same thing\u00a0 for every meal of every day in the same room and hasn\u2019t been exposed\u00a0 to peanut allergens or bad sushi. So if a lab mouse is looking\u00a0 a little low after getting an immunotherapy drug, it was\u00a0 probably because of the drug. And that\u2019s why research is\u00a0 still conducted in animals. Mice have organs and blood and\u00a0 hormones that serve bigger roles in the living animal than a scientist\u00a0 could observe in a section of tissue. By looking at a tumor cell\u00a0 culture under the microscope, you could learn a lot about\u00a0 its uncontrolled reproduction. But you wouldn\u2019t be able to see how it travels to other parts of the body and spreads cancer. So whole lab mice help scientists\u00a0 develop therapies for whole people. But researchers are learning that in one area, these lab mice don't really resemble humans. It\u2019s their immune systems. Despite all of the lab\u00a0 mouse research to find cures for human immune disorders, wild mice have more human-like immune responses. It\u2019s the very qualities that make\u00a0 lab mice so appealing for research that also make them less\u00a0 relevant to solving our problems. Remember, researchers are using inbred populations of pretty\u00a0 much genetically identical mice. And their immune systems\u00a0 haven\u2019t been introduced to as much stuff as ours because they\u00a0 live in a sterile lab environment. So when researchers have tried\u00a0 to take treatments that worked in lab mice and give them to humans,\u00a0 they\u2019ve failed over and over again. One paper published in the\u00a0 journal Nature claims that about 75% of drugs fail somewhere between\u00a0 mouse trials and human trials. Then the first attempt at\u00a0 clinical testing in humans loses another 70% from there, and so on. And researchers believe one\u00a0 reason for that drop off is that lab mice aren\u2019t representative of us. It\u2019s not the only reason drugs fail in humans, but we might be taking that step from\u00a0 rodents to us a little too early. To bridge that gap, some researchers started studying animals that resemble us more closely. We can still use all of the incredible\u00a0 discoveries that have been made over years of lab mouse research by\u00a0 comparing them to a wild relative. Now, compared to inbred, sterile lab mice, pretty much every mouse is wild. So when researchers describe\u00a0 wild mice in their experiments, they run the gamut from pet shop mice to the little guys roaming around your local field. Those wild mice differ from\u00a0 more commonly studied lab mice because there\u2019s genetic\u00a0 variation between individuals. And that might not sound\u00a0 surprising, but when you consider that inbred lab mice don\u2019t\u00a0 have that, it\u2019s a huge factor. Beyond that, wild mice use their\u00a0 genes differently than lab mice. Every gene in your genome isn\u2019t\u00a0 going full tilt at all times. It\u2019s similar to when you\u2019re driving. Just because you can floor the gas pedal doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing 90 in a school zone. You accelerate more when you need to. For your immune system, the time you need to kick it into full gear\u00a0 is when you\u2019re under attack. So in a study published in 2016,\u00a0 scientists exposed a group of lab mice to a few herpesviruses and yellow fever virus. The kind of stuff that a wild mouse\u00a0 might encounter in their daily travels. But those lab mice grew up\u00a0 in sterile environments, and so did their parents\u00a0 and their parents\u2019 parents. So before this infection, their\u00a0 immune systems were totally untrained. Virus? Who\u2019s she? So these lab mice produced fewer immune cells activated fewer immune cells, and had more inexperienced immune systems than wild mice. Across the board, their immune\u00a0 systems were less primed for action. And once the viruses invaded\u00a0 their systems, everything changed. The lab mice adapted. They\u00a0 started showing off some genes that they had previously hidden away. Their genes and immune responses\u00a0 started looking more, like wild mice. Hardened wild mice have been exposed to more dangerous viruses throughout their lives. And all that dangerous stuff\u00a0 can awaken certain hidden and slumbering sections of their genes so that they can help the mouse fight off the threat. So being exposed to viruses and parasites changes how mice use their genes. And if researchers only study\u00a0 sterile inbred lab mice that don\u2019t use some of their immune-related genes, they\u2019re more likely to overlook those genes even in a study specifically aimed\u00a0 to understand the immune system. This 2016 study gives hope that there are ways to counteract those effects!\u00a0 And lab mice don\u2019t even need to be directly infected to\u00a0 make those changes happen. In the same publication, the researchers gave a new set of lab mice wild roommates. Every parent\u2019s sleep-away camp nightmare. But the wild roommates had\u00a0 a really positive impact on their less experienced buddies. They exposed the lab mice\u00a0 to stuff they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise been exposed to,\u00a0 and ramped up their genes to be more prepared and more\u00a0 closely resemble the wild mice, and by extension, us. So there are ways to make lab\u00a0 mouse experiments more relevant to those of us who don\u2019t live in\u00a0 completely sterile environments, which is pretty much all of us. But because there\u2019s still so much\u00a0 value in lab mouse experiments, some researchers are studying a new type of mouse. One that\u2019s not quite a lab mouse\u00a0 and not quite a wild mouse. They\u2019re breeding lab mice with wild mice in an initiative called the Collaborative Cross. The Collaborative Cross is a new, more diverse group of mouse breeds. Basically, researchers still get to work with a select group of mice that\u00a0 have well understood genes, similar to lab mice. But now they have more kinds of\u00a0 mice and they\u2019re more diverse, like the mice you\u2019d find in the wild. Using this approach, researchers\u00a0 can get reproducible results and include more representative genetic variation. And it\u2019s already led to more human-like results. For example, you have a gene called Foxp3 that keeps your immune\u00a0 system from fighting itself. But not everyone has the same\u00a0 amount of Foxp3 in their genome. And researchers think that\u00a0 may be at least part of why some of our immune systems turn against themselves in autoimmune disorders, while that\u00a0 doesn\u2019t happen for other people. But we wouldn\u2019t know all of that\u00a0 without a study published in 2017 that found more variable amounts of\u00a0 Foxp3 in Collaborative Cross mice than inbred mice, making\u00a0 them one step closer to us. And that\u2019s just the first stepping\u00a0 stone across the gap to humans. The next stepping stone is\u00a0 called Diversity Outbred mice. Instead of orchestrating a new\u00a0 set of Collaborative Cross breeds, Diversity Outbred animals are the\u00a0 babies of any and all mice coming from the Collaborative Cross founding mice. So now there\u2019s a way more representative sample. And, just as researchers hoped,\u00a0 those mice have helped them narrow down a gene related to tumor\u00a0 suppression in pancreatic cancer. They combed through the genomes\u00a0 of 270 Diversity Outbred mice and found that this gene\u00a0 consistently popped up even across the really broad group of mice. And that gives researchers added\u00a0 confidence that it\u2019s not just a fluke that might come from the unnaturally\u00a0 restricted sample of inbred lab mice. So we\u2019re heading into a more representative future with more narrowed down\u00a0 causes for immune disorders and immune-mediated diseases,\u00a0 including new cancer targets! Ultimately, studying wild\u00a0 mice in the lab doesn\u2019t mean that the existing inbred mice\u00a0 are a broken model system. It just helps us sift through those findings and focus on the stuff that\u2019s more likely\u00a0 to treat disease in the real world. Lab mice are pretty fundamental to research. But after those smarty-pants scientists\u00a0 gather tons of immunology info from their mice, they need\u00a0 to do something with it. That\u2019s where the next fundamental\u00a0 research skill comes in: data analysis. If the term \u201cdata analysis\u201d feels\u00a0 like I might as well be speaking a different language to you,\u00a0 then you might benefit from Brilliant\u2019s course on \u201cData\u00a0 Analysis Fundamentals.\u201d It\u2019s the fundamentals of a fundamental!

      "corpus": "let's read the next thing that it asks us it says question um his calculus the vehicle needs to complete this journey within 12 hours now just like I did before but before you guys came in the room there's a essential piece of information so maybe not jot that down right 12 hours whilst remaining under the speed limit so I'm going to put less than 12 hours whilst remaining under the speed limit of 90 kilometers per hour so I'm going to say less than 90 kilometers per hour so what this is giving us by the way does anyone know there's a there's a name for this these two piece information starts with a B anyone know what it's called if you don't know you don't even need to know what's called but it's actually good language for you guys to have these are called Boundaries right so what we've got is we don't have a car that can go infinite kilometers per hour right and we also don't have an infinite amount of time like you can't just go at one kilometer per hour and take forever okay so these set out upper and lower boundaries for what values we can put into this speed okay at what speed V Should the vehicle be driven to minimize the cost C whilst arriving at the destination now remember you guys told me right at the start right the faster you drive the more you're going to have to spend on petrol right but you can't drive too slow because then you will arrive too late does that make sense now as soon as we know I'm trying to minimize what's the thing that I'm going to do to that cost function over there I'm going to differentiate right so let's do this um usually you guys are used to seeing Dy on DX but there are no wires and no X's to be found so in fact I'm going to be differentiating D what DC that's the function on the left and I'm not differentiating with respect to X I'm differentiating with respect to V that's my variable okay now I'm so confident we can do this part I will just sneakily take this and write it as a v to the negative one why do you think that's helpful yeah I can just use the power law when I'm differentiating it right so let's just differentiate it 10v differentiate it gives you 10 well done and then 93 000 V to the negative one what happens to the negative yep so I'll go minus 93 000. and then what happens to that negative one that's up in your next now reduce it so I'll go V to the negative two okay so I've got 10 take away 93 000 on V squared are you okay with that as a derivative DC on David now I think I should be oh went to a room with no eraser okay I'm gonna get you guys while I go find a whiteboard um eraser two once you've got this derivative here huh what do you do with that to find a minimum that's what you're looking for okay so we want we want to substitute zero but just be careful what am I substituting zero for like can I put zero in here no you can't right you want the this derivative to actually equal zero right because what we're hoping is we might guess that the function looks something like this right and where we find the derivative is zero is this stationary Point down the bottom right now by the way I don't actually know that to be sure the function could look like this for all I know if you if the function looked like this and you found where DC on DV equals zero what does that tell you does that tell you the minimum cost it actually tells you the the maximum cost which is a bad thing right so we're going to have to not only find where it's equal to zero we're going to need to show that it's a minimum not a maximum that's actually really important because sometimes the minimum isn't out like suppose this really was it right we find a Stationary Point that's not it what are we going to use instead it's that word to that started with B before right it's the it's one of the boundaries is going to tell us right it's either the slowest we can possibly go or the fastest we can possibly go one of those will be the actual minimum okay so let me pause right there I'm going to get a an eraser and that'll give you some time to get a derivative okay this is what I've got so far can someone tell me if I'm going on the right track or if I'm going crazy yeah it's my arithmetic okay so all I did was I set this which you guys told me was the derivative I set it to be equal to zero because that's where stationary points are um I then said well I'll add this to both sides right so that's what's put them on opposite sides divided by 10 and then I multiply both sides by V squared is that okay yep so this is what I've got yes agreement no I mean that doesn't look like a square number to me unless it's one I'm not familiar with you do have to be careful though right when you go from here to here there are two solutions to this quadratic equation but we only want the positive one can someone tell me why oh you can't go backwards presumably we want to actually arrive at us at our destination not um not go away from it okay so this is what I've got okay I've got a stationary point but what did we say before like is this just the answer what is by the way what can someone give me that as a decimal what is the square root of 9 300. it's like 96.44 96.4 kilometers per hour okay now have a look at this right is this okay is this susceptible I think if I'm not mistaken I've already hit a problem haven't I I'm over the speed limit right now this is exactly what I was talking about before right I said one of the issues with um finding a stationary report is you don't know what kind of stationary point it is right you don't know if it's a good one a minimum in this case or a bad one right but now what I've found is where my stationary point is not even within my boundaries do you see that so I'm like oh this will apparently minimize the cost maybe we should differentiate again let's just do that to be sure but I can't even go at that speed right does that make sense let's just make sure we do know that we're we're doing this right if I went and differentiated again which would give me this okay so what happens to that 10 when you differentiate another time it just disappears then you get negative two multiplied by negative 93 000. is that okay which last I checked will give you one eight six thousand is that okay V to the what happens to the power negative three very good so just have a look at this you don't even need to do any kind of calculation so you don't need a calculator right if you take a value of V like this it's positive right so you put it in here can you tell me because I only care if this thing is positive or negative it's a second derivative so I'm trying to work out am I concave up or concave down which one is it I don't even need to know its value it's a positive number divided by some other positive number would that result be positive or negative can be positive positive divided by positive will always be positive so you're like oh that's good I do have a minimum right so that is um you know when you substitute in but it's a minimum that's actually outside of our allowable domain right do you remember the word domain like where you're allowed to put in X values in this case it's V values right so therefore since this is too fast what's the closest we can get to it the closest V to the actual minimum is 90 kilometers per hour right because you can't go any faster than that it's a bit funny isn't it we've gone through all this work to find using calculus what the stationary point is but we've found is it's illegal sorry about that right but that's your answer right and you can test it by the way you can just check to see if you're like I'm not convinced this is the right answer see this um V value we can put it into our original cost equation do you remember that cost was equal to oh help me remember 10v plus 93 000 on V is that right so you could put 90 into here actually in fact can you can you put 90 into that tell me what you get and then you can also put something else like say 89 that is also another legal speed right and C do I get something better or do I get it worse when you put in 90 what do you get what's your actual cost it'll be a decimal I assume someone got it oh 1933.3 recording cool dot dot so just under 2 000. when you put in 89 you notice what happens right this number gets bigger but this number gets smaller so that's why we use calculus but what do you actually get what's the cost one one are you sure I'm like that's that's interesting 1934 was it 0.94 okay so no point there yeah so you can see it's a dollar more of course it's not a big difference because it's only one kilometer per hour difference but can you see how what we've done is we used our our model where you play calculus to it and then well the calculus actually told us based on our conditions that the optimal thing is actually too fast so therefore we've got to go to the speed limit that's why the boundaries are so important make sense I will just say one last thing before I send you guys off there's probably a few lines of working that I've not written here because I've just explained it to you but all the logic is probably the important part to capture right so I hope you guys found that helpful"

      "corpus": "in this video I'm going to be trying to oddly satisfying Tick Tock to see if they're actually satisfying let's find out so this is clear slime in a container and they're adding dye but in each rectangle they're adding one more droplet which is really satisfying and then after mixing it all up it creates a really cool color gradient let's try it in order to try this we're gonna need three things the container slime and dye first we put the clear slime in the container pick our favorite color I choose blue then Drop It Like It's Hot no not like that Batman after that we mixed it all together to see if it actually works and honestly I think it turned out pretty satisfying but let's try it again with different colors now we mix it up mixers mix so everything was going super satisfying but then I ran into a sticky situation get off of me let go of my fingers there we go and it was worth it in the end because it looked glorious that actually looks pretty cool but to make it even better let's combine all the colors together to make a super satisfying Rainbow Slime another satisfying thing you can do with slime involves mesh but in order to try this I had to buy a backpack just destroy it so after we cut out our mesh we wrap it over the Slime wrap it real good yes now let's give it a nice juicy squeeze that was super satisfying 10 out of 10. but before you fall asleep probably the most satisfying thing about slime is ASMR I mean listen to this you can't deny that crunch also did I mention it smells like that's a lot of balls what do you mean by that so this stuff is called kinetic sand and it creates really satisfying ASMR oh from the balls dropping all the way to the Smashing very nice let's try it first we need some blue kinetic sand then cut it up into squares after that we roll up the skirts into the perfect size balls prepare to be satisfied in three two one oh that was nice let's make it rain again nice one more time [Music] perfect I hope you enjoyed that but let's try it again with different colors wow this one was really satisfying comment which one you liked more the blue balls or the colorful squares another satisfying thing you can do with Kinetic Sand involves a light bulb first make a luxurious sand castle wow then use light bulb to collapse it after that you can do some crunchy ASMR and turn it into a forbidden waffle now that looks tasty you can also use a bowl to make kinetic sand Jello does it giggle and then you can slice it up satisfying style that's enough slices another cool thing you can do with Kinetic Sand is make Purple Rain nice you can even use cookie cutters with Kinetic Sand to make nice ASMR and any size sand cookie you want is this too big how about smaller how about a flower or a star or even a heart that you can give to your crush that was nice very nice but honestly how do you even do that I'm a little nervous that if I tried this I could possibly get injured but I guess we'll find out first let's grab the bar soap oh shoot it slumped uh let's grab this one but before we penetrate the soap I'm gonna need protection what did he say now let's get to work oh dang this is actually really hard let's toss it in the microwave oh nice much softer let's try again now we have the perfect cubes this was a little satisfying but I think I can do better but the only problem is it took me 30 minutes just to carve out one so here's a quick time lapse of me carving out more soap so you don't have to let's go starting with green blue Orange honestly this was kind of satisfying but I think I need a little bit more practice if you thought that soap slicing was satisfying here's another way you can do it now that was pretty cool that one was nice but probably my favorite thing you can do with bar soap is to carve it into anything you want but I'll tell you right now I never claimed to be a bar soap Carver but after about an hour of carving this is what I made [Music] oh that's a nice sizzle but this seems like it could possibly start a fire if something goes wrong let's give it a shot but we have a problem I don't have any lipstick but my wife's Tori does here's lipstick here's a marble here's fire okay now we drop the 100 degree marble onto the lipstick oh listen to that Sizzle sizzle nice another satisfying thing you can do with lipstick is slice it with the razor blade you can also carve it into a shed for self-defense stay back you can even use lipstick as a pen life hack which is actually pretty useful dear viewer please subscribe here's a cookie but probably the most barbaric yet satisfying thing you can do with lipstick is simply smash it don't worry I'll fix it there we go whoa that's a lot of noodles let's get cooking okay so I think I've seen this gadget in my kitchen here it is nice let's start with blue foam okay pink foam that's cool purple foam nice how about blue pink and purple foam combined oh I like that one how about clay let's start with green clay this stuff is actually really hard I'm literally shaking it's like a workout but it looks super cool like some futuristic alien slime how about Orange clay this is looking like where your boy Nemo lives now let's try pink clay okay okay that one was pretty satisfying I never would have thought a kitchen gadget would make such satisfying content but honestly this is really messy so while I go ahead and clean up this sticky stuff let's move on to the next experiment oh what is this so I think this stuff is chalk and it does look and sound oddly satisfying let's give this one a try this is Jim chalk made from rock climbing gymnastics and weightlifting but instead of using it for that I'm gonna crush it to make satisfying content for you guys first up the claw crushing technique honey knife technique carving technique rainbow knife technique potato Mastery technique well that didn't work and personally my favorite the pasta strainer technique wow that was really satisfying but now my pasta will be contaminated and now I'm hungry is this one of those organizing videos yep that's a lot of chapstick or lipstick or lip gloss whatever it is so I guess now I have extensive organized let's try it this looks a little messy let's organize my skincare starting with the cleansers serums okay we're getting there much better moisturizers looking good finish off with sunscreen wow that was a blast Skittles smashed her pass I'm gonna go with smash yep that one's pretty satisfying Electronics uh I'm gonna pass on that one looks a little too dangerous for me is that a hammer I'm gonna go with pass what's that stuff coming out I don't know if it's satisfying but it is oddly satisfying let's try it introducing hydraulic press at home let's start off with the juicy tomato how about a blueberry grape watermelon popcorn now for the final boss the red Skittle I would say that was finger licking satisfying put glue on your hand and wait for it to dry then peel it off okay that does sound satisfying and my parents never let me do this in elementary school so now's my chance but first let me wash my hands squeaky clean Elmer's clear glue now let's get a juicy glob all over the entire hand perfect now I need to wait one hour for it to completely dry a few moments later the Moment of Truth boys and girls [Music] okay that was worth the wait but I'm still not satisfied so let's try something with even more adhesive the notorious bjor of blackhead Port strips wait 10 minutes 10 minutes later and here goes nothing not bad but I'm still not satisfied so let's try a 24 karat gold peel off mask made with real gold this is not only a luxurious experience but I'm expecting this peel to be extremely satisfying 20 minutes later Here's the final result comment below what you thought was most satisfying thank you for watching And subscribe so I can buy Tori more lipstick"

      "corpus": "hyah topic of this video is Matt exchange multiplication already I have one video in my playlist but there are few things I have missed there in that video so it may be a little bit confusing for the students who are making a new video on the same topic the problem in YouTube is we cannot edit the video I cannot add something to the video so I have to make a new video once again so the contents of the video are what is Mattox multiplication I'll explain this then what does it mean by matrix chain multiplication and how to apply dynamic programming so here I will be giving you the idea approach for solving a problem using dynamic programming right then if you're interested in learning problem solving then don't miss this part then I use the formula of dynamic programming and show you how to solve the problem what should be the approach for solving the problem now the last thing I will show you a example problem and if you are here one day before the examination then you need this one directly so you can directly jump on to this part of the video and you can finish it so you learn how to solve a problem that's all right so how the formula is obtained and all details you have to spend time definitely and if you are watching for learning the problem and learning problem solving then this there are a lot of things to learn from this video so let us start with matrix multiplication first of all matrix multiplication see there are two matrices in this example a and B as of dimension two rows three columns two rows and three columns and B's of dimension three rows and two columns three rows and two columns first of all the condition for multiplying two matrices is the number of columns of the first matrix must be equal to number of rows of second Matrix means these two must be equal that is these two must be equal then multiplication can be done this is the condition for multiplication and how we multiply us we multiply all the elements of a row single row with all the elements of a single column multiply the elements and add their products so that is shown here this is how multiplication is done so this is how one single element is obtained but what is the dimension of the resultant matrix the resultant matrix a into B let us call it as C this is of dimension 2 cross 2 then one more thing total how many multiplications I have done let us see 1 2 3 1 2 3 so 3 how many times 4 times so 2 L multiplications I have done so actually if you see the number of multiplications I have done for getting this result as 2 3 2 to do so so trees 2 and 12 multiplications I have done for obtaining this resultant matrix that is a into B so from this we have to pick a few things first is when two medicines can be multiplied this condition that this must be equal then only multiplication can be done does the important thing second thing what will be the resultant matrix dimension of the resulting matrix the dimension of the resultant matrix will be these two extremes that is number of rows of first matrix and the number of columns of second Matrix that is - gross - this is the second point and the third point that we have to pick up is for generating or multiplying the matrix total how many multiplications are required that is this dimension into this one and this one this is common right this is same so 2 into 3 into 2 so 2 into 3 into 2 these many multiplications are required so these are the important things and one more important thing I will show you that we must know for further understanding see I have two minuses a and B and if you take dimensions total how many are there first second third fourth so two medicines total for dimension but these two must be same so let us call it as one so if we call it as one then total how many dimensions one two three so total three dimensions are the three different values are there right and this is the first matrix of dimension and these are the second matrix dimension and one of the dimension is common so for the two matrices total three different dimensions are there where one of the dimension is common for them so that's all the important things I have highlighted here that is useful for matrix chain multiplication now let us learn about what does it mean by a matrix chain multiplication for explaining Mattox chain multiplication I have an example here I have three medicines even a 2 a 3 and I want to multiply them so there are more than two matrices so and I want to multiply them so first of all check whether they can be multiplied or not see if I take these two medicines than the dimensions this should be matching number of columns of first one should be equal to number of rows of second one yes they are matching they can be multiplied and if I take these two and then see this are matching yes they can be multiplied now these are a 1 a 2 a 3 dimensions also I will label them let us call this as a d 0 and these two are same so let us call both of them as D 1 D 1 and these two are same so this let us call this as and D 2 D 2 and D 3 this labeling may help us afterwards let us I have given the labels now let us proceed so I want to multiply these three medicines now the question is can I multiply all three together no I have to multiply two matrices at a time then what are the possible ways see the first method is I can multiply a 1 with a 2 and the result of it a 3 this is one possible and another possible method is even as it is then a 2 and a 3 I should multiply first then the even should be multiplied with the result of product of a two and a dream so there are two possible methods see whether this one and this one gives same result yes they are associative associative property holds on matrix multiplication whether you multiply these two first then the result with this one or first these two and this with the result you get the same answer so the product of three minuses will be same so you can multiply it any either way now whatever the elements may be there in a 1 a 2 a 3 I am NOT interested in that I am NOT really trying to multiply them I want to know how much efforts I have to put in for multiplying them so let us see if I multiply a 1 with a 2 then total how many multiplications I have to do how many multiplications I have to perform so what are those dimensions 2 3 & 3 4 so total how many multiplications will be done here for multiplying this this is 2 into 3 into 4 these are 24 multiplications this side total 24 multiplications if I'm multiplying madiso say one with a 2 total 24 multiplications I have to perform for those elements now what about this one this is dimensions are 4 2 but how many this if you take this separately no multiplications required for this one so 24 multiplications for this and this is nothing now I have to multiply these two together right this whole thing this whole thing with this one so total how many multiplications required for this this this will be having dimensions to cross 4 right see you remember the resultant matrix will have the dimensions of these two number of rows of first one and number of columns of second one these two and this 1 4 2 so these 2 are same yes multiplication can be done so total how many multiplications for this this is 2 into 4 into 2 so these are 16 multiplications right these are total 16 now if you find out altogether 24 multiplications this side plus 0 multiplication that site plus the sixteen multiplications so this is how much 24 plus 16 40 multiplications I have to do multiplying these two takes twenty four multiplications and this is nothing there's a single matrix is zero then multiplying these two together as two for two so total 40 multiplications are required what about this let us take this the dimensions are 2 3 and this is 3 4 & 4 2 first of all I have to multiply this this is 3 into 4 into 2 so this is 24 and the result of this the dimensions will be 3 2 and what about this side this side will be 0 no multiplications required on this side now when I have to multiply these two together the dimensions are 2 3 and this is 3 do right these are the dimensions like this one and this one so these two are common so same we can multiply these 2 are same we can multiply so total how many multi predictions required for this one 2 into 3 into 2 then plus what about this side 0 what about this side this is total multiplications are 24 24 so 24 plus this is 2 3 6 12 so this is 36 multiplication so total 36 modifications are required so observe this carefully you wash it once again this portion is very important this calculation and from this we can say that if I multiply these 2 first and the result with this one or this is the result of this one the cost of multiplication is different means the number of multiplications I have to perform for getting the results are different so which parentheses ation is better means first I should multiply these two matrices then this with the result of this one that will take only 36 multiplication so it's a small example of just three matrices and there are there is a difference of just 4 so 4 is not a small figure right because the number of matrices are very small we are looking at a very small level if suppose you have mattis's a 1 multiplied with a 2 multiplied with a 3 goes on to a 10 their total cost of multiplication means which mattresses should be multiplied first it is a big problem there so you cannot simply start multiplying a a 1 with a 2 then the result with a trill result is a 4 so it will be very very huge if you find out easier method for multiplying them then it's better so first find out how to multiply them then multiply the matricis so that's it if you have the chain of mattresses for multiplication then first of all find out which multiplication should be performed such that the total efforts put in for multiplying them should be minimized this is Matt exchange multiplication problem so if the chain of mattresses are there that has to be multiplied how the parents addition should be done such that the efforts required for multiplying the medicine should be less see here you can see that if you multiply these two and the result with this one is 40 and this way it is 36 so this is better and if you have 10 mattresses then there may be different possibilities and one of the possibility maybe a best possibility so that's it we have to find out the best possible parenthesis ation such that the total cost of multiplication is minimized now we need a approach for finding the minimum one so dynamic programming approach say is that you should try all possible parenthesis ation and pick up the best one possible all possible one and pick up the best one so for 10 we have to try all possibilities and then whichever is giving minimum you have to take that pattern of multiplication so for 3 how many are there only 2 are there so we tried both of them and we found this is better so we have already done this but this we can't think of doing on 10 mattresses imagine how many possibilities you will have but we must find out all possible from that we should pick up the best one so for this we need some formula that is by using this approach we need some formula let us frame a formula for dynamic programming format exchange multiplications so here already I have an example so this I will convert it into a formula right I have two examples here from this only I will make a formula first of all watch this very carefully am creating or generating a formula from this example so let us say I want to find out the minimum cost for multiplication so I have to find out the cost of one two three so there are three matrices let us say cost of 1 2 3 so I just write C now for cost ok then let us look at this observe this what is this 24 this is the cost of multiplying 1 and do so I will remove this as I move this and this I will say cost of multiplying 1 to 2 and what is the 0 see a was writing 0 that was not required that time I should have skipped but now this is useful you see this is cost of multiplying third matrix with the third Matic something so the cost of this side is 1 to 2 cost of that side is radio 3 and that was 0 and this was 24 this was 24 I will write it right this is 0 24 and 0 so cost of this one and cost of this one so final result what I was getting this was cost of 1 to 2 and this was cost of 3 to 3 and 3 to 3 is 0 because the single matrix then what was this the cost of multiplying these two together these two together so these are the dimensions I have what is this dimension this one this is a d 0 this is d 0 what is this dimension this 1 this is what D 2 this is D 2 so this is nitu and what is this dimension this one last one right what is that D 3 this is d 3 so what are these this is D 0 and this is D 2 and this is D B 0 D 2 D 3 I have multiplied these three and I got the result as 40 now let us convert this also into the formula this is first cost off one come upon cost of multiplying 1 comma 1 itself that 0 it is a single matrix only and what is this cost of 2 2 3 and what is this 24 how to get this 1 this is 3 into 4 into 2 we know interval so and it is cost of multiplying 2 root 3 then what is this cost of 1 comma 1 and this is what cost of 2 comma 3 and what are these dimensions this is this is the first one and that is D 0 this is D 0 right and this is 3 this is an e 1 3 3 is in D 1 yes this is d 1 and this is the last one that is D 3 this is d 3 and this is 36 so I have made it like a formula cost of this side left side cost of right side then cost of multiplying two together so I got it in the form of formula let us observe this if you observe 1 2 3 3 1 1 2 3 so if you observe the first one and the last one are same let us call this as I and this as J and this as I and this as J in both I and J are same then what about this D 0 D 3 D 0 D 3 and this is d1 and this is d2 so let us call this as D I minus 1 and this is J is 3 right this is DG let us call this as D of I minus 1 and this is DJ then what is this this is a 2 & 3 this is 1 & 2 so if this is 1 this is 2 if this is 2 this is 3 this is what I am observing right this is my from the observation I am creating a formula then this is a d1 and this is d2 so it means that that part should come first so let me write a formula so I'll write the formula here I'll write it here see I have to find out the cost off for I Comanche is what this site cost of I comma what is this I should call it as K and this is K plus 1 so I'm here also I should call it as K and this is K plus 1 so now if you observe everything is perfect see see you off or I ke k plus 1 to J see off of I k k plus 1 to J so when you say I J that are 1 3 and these are also 1 3 k is here 2 & 3 k is here 1 & 2 and this is 0 & 3 this is 0 & 3 so I minus 1 J I minus 1 J and this is DK k is 1 first time and k is to that second time so let us call it as DK okay this is K so based on this I will write a formula now this side see off I can cost of left side plus cost of right side k plus 1 to j then plus d of i minus 1 k and DJ dimension i minus 1 into as remove this dimension K into dimension J so have combined these two together in terms of ijk then what K is taking the value K is here first time 1 and second time - so that should come first then this one Sookie can takes the values that are starting from I is what 1 1 so K takes the values from I but less than J K is not becoming 3 K became 1 and K became two that's all out of these two I want minimum I want minimum so this is the formula for Mack Chane multiplication so from examples of just three matrices I have prepared the formula so the idea here is that once again I will tell you this is the cost of multiplying these two sides then what is the cost of left side cost of right side those two are it done here cost of left side and cost of right side how I multiply these by multiplying three dimensions right what about this cost this also multiply these dimensions three dimensions and give the result multiply these three dimensions and get the result it's the same thing so the cost of multiplying two minuses you have to multiply the dimensions and you get the number of multiplications so here is a formula this formula will give you minimum so you should try different values of K here we tried K as 1 than K as a 2 as you have three matrices so only K value can be one and two if you have more mattresses than K value give me 1 2 3 4 so on if you have 10 mattresses up to 9 it will go so this formula says that try all possibilities and pick up the best one minimum 1 what are the possibilities you change the K value so some on this side some on that side so now I will write down the formula here and I will remove this and I will show you how it looks like for for mattresses then afterwards we will solve a problem here I have four mattresses and let us say dimensions are d0 d1 and d2 d3 d4 these are the dimensions what are the possible ways of multiplying those mattresses before match actually multiplying mattresses we want to know which parentheses ation will require less efforts of multiplication so there are many methods of parenthesis ation this is the first one a one with this one a two with the result of 2 3 right 3 4 then a 1 then inside this 3 first I can multiply these 2 then this 1 so this is another pattern solution or even a two-bit result of a 3 or 4 or this site a 4 is left over a 1 with result of a 2 a 3 then this entire thing with a for a first you need to delicately resolute therefore there are five different methods of parents inhalation so if you want to know for four mattresses how many patterns installations are possible five so if you want to know how many multiplications are required for this one so there is a formula called Catalan number as we have four mattresses so you can use that actually the formula is a 2 NC n by n plus 1 but here you have to take n as number of mattresses minus 1 so n should be 4 minus 1 you should not take and as a for just you take 3 and then you get dancer so if there are four mattresses then actual value if I write here is 2 into n minus 1 C of n minus 1 by n minus 1 plus 1 is n only so this will be the formula modified format exchange multiplication so let us put this one I have for Madison so this will be what if I take four mattresses 2 into 4 minus 1 that is a 3 and see this is also 3 by this is n for mattresses are there where n is 4 I have taken in as 4 so this will be 6 C 3 by 4 so 63 by 4 is 6 into 5 into 4 divided by 3 into 2 into 1 whole divided by 4 4 4 gives cancel teeth 2 3 6 cancel so 5 is the answer and if you take n is equals to 5 mantises then take one less for N and put this in this formula then you will get 14 so 4 5 Madison's 14 multiplications are required right foot impossible parent solutions are there for this 5 possible parent solutions are there so out of these 5 we have to pick up the best parenthesis ation that is giving minimum result so this we will do it using the formula so now I will remove this I will use this formula and show you how I can apply that formula on these four mattresses and if I apply what problems I faced then I will show you the solution for that problem then later on we will find example problem so I will use the formula on this for mattresses we don't have the dimensions let them be D 0 D 1 D 2 only when we see the example that time I take some values if I apply the formula the cost of CEO of one to four because four 9s asada that are one before so I is 1 and J is for this should be minimum of minimum of K should take the values greater than or equal to I is what 1 and less than J that is 4 so what are the possible values K can take K can be 1 K can be 2 and K can be 3 3 values are possible for K less than 4 so if I put K as a 1 in this one right what it looks like CEO of I is 1 J is for remember this one comma K is what 1 plus C of k plus 1 K is 1 min ski is 2 k plus 1 is 2 and G is a 4 plus this is D of I minus 1 I is what I got 1 this is 0 D 0 plus K DK k is what now K I'm taking in s 1 K is 1 and this is into sorry and this is into D for this is K value as 1 if I take K value has a 2 this is 1 2 2 plus C or 4 3 2 4 + D 0 + D - sorry into D 2 into D for then if I take K value as a 3 then this is 1 3 plus C of 4 4 plus D 0 into D 3 in 2d for if I expand the formula I get a 3 different tones 3 different values all of this I have to take minimum I'm not writing them in a single line it will be very lengthy on paper and you can do that right so comma comma this common this come on this one so K is 1 K is 2 K is 3 out of this it is trying all possible parenthesis ation right so actually these means if I draw first one means a1 with a2 a3 a4 how they are multiplied we don't know so this is a 1 1 this is 2 2 4 the cost of this and how what is the cost of multiplying these two their dimensions D 0 D 1 and D for then what the second one means second one means a1 with a 2 and this parenthesis then this is a3 and a4 so the parent isolation is done at Matt X 2 K is a 2 so want to go on this side 3 to 4 on this side then cost of this and cost of this then cost of multiplying these two cost of multiplying these 2 then this one last one says a1 a2 a3 and this side is a 4 so the cost of multiplying all 3 with this result 1 2 3 & 4 2 4 1 2 3 & 4 2 4 then the cost of multiplying these two together these 2 together so this is trying all possibilities now if I know the answer if I know the values I can put these values and get the answer so from this you already know two values what are those c1 1 single matrix 0 you remember we have taken it and see for 4 it is 0 this is 0 then what about c2 for let me put it here this I can take it as 0 but C 2 for let me expand c2 for is minimum or it's a formula again K takes the values from 2:00 till 4 so K can take what values K can be 2 and K can be 3 so 2 values it can take now from this if I take the formula C is a 2 J is a 4 I do G's for remember this 2 comma 2 plus C of 3 comma 4 plus dimension 2 into dimension sorry this is 1 and 2 and this is dimension so see I k k plus 1 2 j k is 1 right this is di minus 1 DK and each so you can check it you can pause and check it i have used the formula here where k values 2 IJ and r2 for now see i k k is 3 plus c of k plus 1 that is 4 2 j that is 4 then plus D I minus 1 I is a 2 so d1 into d k k is 3 3 in 2d for oh it means that for finding C of 2 comma 4 again I need formulas 2 comma 4 I need again formula so in this one this value I know 0 4 4 0 then what about the 3 4 so on n I will find out C this thing this thing this entire formula is just one cost here this one what about this what about this what about this I have to find out all of them so it's too lengthy for finding this one first of all I should find out this right and find out these so why can't we first find out these smaller values then go for larger value so what does it mean by smaller value larger value let us check this 4-1 how much 3 so this require three formulas three values right very different values this is 4 minus 2 this is 2 so this required to value sort of which we will pick up anyone then what about 3 1 comma 2 it will have only 1 value and what about three comma four it will have only one value see the difference is one difference is one and differences zero difference is a - right difference is two so it means first I should find out which formulas where the difference of I and J is zero then it is 1 then it is a two then it is a three in this way I should proceed I should not put the formula and first find out this one then for this I have to find out this it will be going expanding like this it's not practical it's not practical then how I should do this one so first I should find smaller values then I can get the larger value and one more important thing you observe here see I have three comma four in this formula I have three comma four here also so if I find out three comma four it is useful at a different places right not just at one place it is useful that a difference list is 4 comma 4 that's the same thing only right so it means how actually we should solve this problem so for this we will prepare a table we will prepare our table four rows four columns now this represents so this is one two three four and one two three four these are row numbers let us call them as I and these are column numbers let us call them as J so what I will do is first I will find out smaller values that is C of 1 1 C of 2 to see off 3 3 and C or 4 for this I will find out means one 1 two 2 three 3 four 4 so this will already 0 I know it right so already I have shown you this one so this will be 0 so I fill them with 0 already then I will find out the values which differences one difference is 1 Mills 4 1 2 2 3 3 4 right C 1 2 & 2 3 & 3 for these values I will find out then the difference with two difference with 3 finally so in this way I will have filled this diagonal than this diagonal than this diagonal and this diagonal so in this way let us find out the cost so let us start finding the cost from smaller values not from the larger value this is okay and what should be the name of that table let us call it as I am calling it as sina cost cost so let us see see in the previous video I wrote it as M because this was a Desai was taking it as M M so M for Mattox multiplications the cost of matrix multiplication you can use any name that is not a shoe now one more table I will make what is that table I'll prepare a table first so this is again four rows four columns four rows four columns I will prepare this is one two three four and one two three four what is this for see out of these three aisle between the minimum one and that cost I'll be writing there yes remember this out of these two I'll be taking the minimum one and I will be writing the cost of 2 comma 4 here 2 comma 4 I will be filling it so I will find out minimum of these 2 so what is the difference between these 2 k value is different k value so k value is a 2 and k values 3 so i need to know for which K value I got this minimum answer k can be 1 K can be 2 k can be 3 so which k has given me a minimum answer so DISA table let us call it as k table okay and in the previous video I was calling it as si table so in the textbooks you will find s as the name so I have taken s only but now here I am using variable K so let us call it as key table K values will be there now I will take an example problem and I will solve it let us see how we can solve it by first solving smaller problems then with the larger problem so in this table already we knows 1 1 2 2 3 3 right and for food now let us fill up the list of the value so I will take some dimensions for the for mattresses and I will solve it so I have taken the dimensions for mitosis are there this is a dimension B 0 and this is D 1 this is D 2 D 3 before for dimensions that is total 5 dimensions starting from 0 onwards 0 1 2 3 4 so format assess I have now as I said that we will use this formula but we will not directly put 1 comma 4 here we will put smaller value so in which way we will start with differences that is a difference 0 difference 1 and defense 2 different 0 already I have fill there so it is just like C of 1 comma 1 if I want C of 1 comma 1 so formula says minimum all right K takes the values greater than or equal to 1 but less than 1 so greater than equal to 1 equal to 1 I can take but less than 1 how I can take so I cannot take any K value so the result of a sea of 1 comma 1 s is ego that's where all that it is 0 similarly for 2 2 3 3 4 4 also it is 0 now we will find out difference 1 so here I will write down C of 1 comma 2 so let us find out C of 1 comma 2 this one I am finding so its minimum of let us put it in the formula formula says that k10 take the values starting from 1 but it should be less than 2 so yes K can take only 1 value that is 1 so let us put it if I make K as 1 then what it will be C of 1 comma k k is what 1 K I'm taking it as 1 so 1 C of 1 comma 1 plus C of k plus 1 case what 1 so 2 then J J's what to this is I this is J remember this so 2 2 plus D of I minus 1 is 1 so B 0 into D K that is a d1 into DJ that is d2 with only one K value possible so this is only the value so that itself is minimum so find out what are D 0 D 1 D 2 so D 0 is how much 3 right and D 1 is how much D 1 is a 2 and D 2 is how much D 2 is a 4 then what about C 0 0 already we have it in a table that is the benefit we will get now if you start from smaller values for soldering such formulas this is 0 plus 0 plus this one how much it is two-three-six-six for 34 so the result of 1 comma 2 is 34 so I will write here 24 first time I do I got and for which value of K I got that 24 1 comma 2 here K value K value was 1 so put it as 1 so key of 1 comma 2 is 1 that K value has given us the result now let us find out C of 2 comma 3 cost of 2 comma 3 so here I write score of 2 3 I is 2 and J is 3 so this is minimum of K can take the values starting from 2 but should be less than 3 so only one value that K can take that is 2 so C of I comma k k is what only possible values 2 i comma k plus c of k plus 1 to j j is 3 right then plus dimension of a k minus 1 that is a D 1 into K then jc2 2 we already have it in the table 0 3 3 also 0 plus D 1 D 2 D 3 D 1 D 2 D 3 2 4 2 so two for two so how much this is 0 plus 0 2 4 8 and 8 into 2 16 so this value is 16 so I will land on the value 16 here this is 16 + 4 which value of K we got that as 16 4 K value as a 2 so 2 comma 3 is 2 right now next value C of next is 3 comma 4 okay so I will not explain simply I will write off okay to save your time and my time so here already I have written it so only your time is saved because I have written this one so C of 3 food 3 food so K takes values from 3 to 4 so only 1 K value is possible that is 3 so I have taken K value as 3 so these are the costs plus the dimension so tossed a zero cost is zero and this is 4 into 2 into 5 so that is 4 into 2 into 5 so 5 force 20 in 20 into 2 and that is 40 what is the answer so the cost of 3 4 is how much 40 cost of 3 comma 4 is 44 which value of K we got this K value as a 3 so this is 3 comma 4 is 3 which K value has given so one diagonal is over now next diagonal these 2 values with a difference of 2 so I will remove this and I will find out the values for those 2 so the first one is 1 comma 3 so cost of 1 comma 3 cost of 1 comma 3 formula says that minimum K takes the values greater than equal to 1 and less than 3 right so what are the possible values ki can take K can be 1 and K can be 2 K cannot be 3 because it should be less than 3 so let us try both these K as 1 C is 1 and J is 3 remember this 1 comma 3 you remember this so 1 comma 1 see off 2 to 3 plus D 0 into D 1 into D 3 K value is 1 here you put this in the formula you get this one then here C of 1/2 C of 3 3 plus D 0 into D 2 into D 3 these are the two now what are the values this is 0 1 1 is 0 2 3 C 1 1 is 0 2 3 is 16 16 Plus this has to be added dimensions 0 1 3 0 is a 3 1 is the to 3 years - so how much this is 3 - 6 6 - 12 12 plus 16 s 28 so this is 28 so here I will write on 28 many K is 1 what about this c1 2 c1 2 is 24 this is 24 c3 3 is 0 + D 0 D 2 D 3 D 0 3 4 + 2 so 3 into 4 into 2 3 4 - L to L into 2 24 24 plus 24 this is what he ain't so which one has minimum this one is minimum so what is the value of K K is 1 and it is 28 so CEO of 1 3 is 28 and 4 which value of K we got this one K value is 1 that's it now the next one this one right this is to the for C of 2 - 4 I will write down this and explain you so here C of 2 to 4 K can take the values from 2 to 3 so 2 + 3 so if you put 2 here get this n3 it is this one so what is this let us take them and it's 2 2 2 is 0 & 3 to 4 3 to 4 is how much 40 40 plus dimensions I will right afterwards first let us fill up this C of 2 to 3 C of 2 to 3 is how much is 16 16 plus 0 so this looks a smaller ok let us first put the dimensions of first one right what are the dimensions of this D 1 D 2 D for D 1 D 2 D 4 2 4 5 2 into 4 into 5 what about this d1 d3 d4 2 2 5 so 2 into 2 into 5 how much is this 5 4 is 20 into 2 that is 14 40 80 this is 80 and how much is this - 2 4 4 5 20 and this is 36 this is 36 so this is minimum what is the value of K K is at 3 right so how much is this 36 so 2 comma 4 is 36 and for which value of AK a we got this one K as a 3 so kick ass 3 this is 2 comma 4 is 3 only one value is remaining what is that C of 1 comma 4 so I'll remove this and I will find out C of 1 comma 4 C of 1 comma 4 minimum what are the possible values of K K can take the values from 1 2 less than 4 minutes 3 so K can be 1 K can be 2 and K can be 3 so I will expand these then we will put the values and see the result so here I have taken different K values K 1 and K s 2 and K s T so let us write down the values and get the result C 1 1 is 0 C 2 4 is 36 this is 36 and plus D 0 D 1 D 0 and d 4 C this is a 3 and this is a 5 so this is 3 and this is 5 and in between D 1 is 2 B 1 is 2 and what about this C of 1 2 1 2 is 24 and 3/4 3/4 is how much 40 40 plus these dimensions this is 3 and this is a 5 and in between we have D 2 D 2 is 4 then 1 comma 3 1 comma 3 is 28 28 one gamma-rays 28 this 1 plus 4 comma 4 is 0 Plus this is 3 and this is 5 in between D 3 is there that is true sort of this which is minimum let us check 3 2 6 6 5 30 and this is 36 so this is 86 and this is four fives 20 20 into 360 so this is 101 24 this is 124 and this one is 28 and this is 3 2 6 6 5 30 30 and 28 this is 58 so which value K has a 3 has given us minimum value that is 58 and K as a 3 that's it so I got the table filled based on the formula now this means that cost of multiplying these four matrices of these dimensions minimum cost is 58 imagine if you follow other methods the number of multiplications may be 124 or maybe this is 86 so it is much more than this one this is more than double so if you have a 10 Brandi mattis's and you want to multiply them first of all find out how you should multiply to save your time then start multiplication right so we got that the best method will give you 58 number of multiplications so you have to perform only 58 multiplications for performing multiplication of these four matrices so that is the optimal result a minimal result right now how the parent this ization should be done which should be multiplied first then next what how the multiplication should be done that's what the important task is we want the parent is ization so who will give you the parent station this table will give you the K values will give you so let us find the parent in addition by following this K table right that is s table so I will remove this and I will parenthesize these four mattresses based on this so I have four mattresses that is a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 right now how the parenthesis addition should be done follow this see this is the final answer the final answer I remember this this is 1 comma 4 so when you have 1 2 4 then may the paranthesis addition should be done at a tree at a tree you have to do from one before you have to do parents in a tree so at a tree you put the balances for step algorithm once again so that you can separately see them ok this is a 4 so I have written them once again so this is the first parent is happenin so I have taken once again now this is only one matrix when one more text is there you don't have to worry what about these 3 comma 3 1 comma 3 is how much 1 so parent isolation should be done at 2 1 so this has to be separated then definitely what is left over now this is 2 2 trees left over because you will be multiplying two minuses this is separated like how I have separated this ok I should have put parentheses here also see when it was 1 2 4 again I am showing you so it was said that K is 3 we said that K is 3 so I had the 3 I have separated and that side separated now within this bracket 1 2 3 1 2 3 said that 1 2 3 is 1 so put a bracket at 1 then to do 3 goes on that side no this is complete this is total parenthesis Asia so this means that a 1 should be multiplied with the result of a-two a-three and their result should be multiplied with a four so I will show you diagrammatically so as per the brackets if you see a 2 a 3 are multiplied right these two are multiplied then a 1 is multiplied with this then a 4 is multiplied with this final result so this is how multiplication should be done this should be multiplied with the product of this and this should be multiplied with the product of this that's all so from this table I have done the parentheses ation once again I will show you one to four say is three so put a bracket at the three so from one to three right this is food to four separate then one two three says one two three says put a bracket on one put a bracket one one remaining are two and three so two three is a single product that is two minus S one multiplication right don't have to check further so if you check this is 2 comma 3 then you will get 2 only so this says that put a bracket like this like this ok so don't have to do it further if you are doing also you will get the brackets like this so this or the multiplication should be done all right so that's all about the example problem no if you are interested in knowing how much time it will take for finding out the parenthesis ation of matte exchange multiplication how much time it has taken so I have filled the table right that table and this one how many values are there in that one so if you come from here 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 so it means 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 so this is nothing but 4 into 5 by 2 for n mattis's it will be n into n plus 1 by 2 so the time taken for filling that is n square but how I am getting each value so if you consider this 158 I tried all possible values of K and I got that one so key is taken the values from I to J so let us assume that is all so and so that value is not just computed in a so that value is computed by taking different K values so let us say n values we are taking so it is into n n square into n so it is n cube and we can say this is upper bound we can say upper bomb Big O and cube so at most n cube that is the meaning because K is not always taking n value so if you want to go in detail analysis and take all possible values of KS and check it thoroughly also it may be somewhat less than n cube so let us say upper bound is ng so that's all about maddux chain multiplication problem that's all in this video"

      "corpus": "- We're gonna fly on this jet that costs half a million dollars per flight and we're also gonna fly on a $25,000 private jet, a $10,000 first-class seat, a blimp, and so much more. But before I show you what it's like to fly on some of the most luxurious plane on the planet, we're gonna fly on the cheapest plane in the world. It's really rickety. Here's the dollar. I'm very nervous. - Nothing to be nervous about. I've done this half a dozen times. - You've done this six times? (lively music) (engine whirring) Why does this sound like a lawn mower engine? (Doug laughing) Time for ride on world's cheapest plane ticket. (lively music) Oh boy. Oh my... Oh my gosh, round up. We're going so fast. - Come on, get it. - That does not sound safe. - Nah ah. (wind whooshing) - They almost hit the camera. - Whoo! - What are you doing? - Keep your seatbelt on. - Uh, you just focused on keeping me alive, Doug. - I'm trying. (engine whirring) - All right, he's in there. - All right, dibs on the channel. - I got what I need. You can land whenever. - (laughing) No. - Doug, come on. Doug, please. - That guy pays my bills. Be careful. - And if you guys think this is crazy, wait until later in the video when we have the world's most expensive plane ticket on the planet. - Wait a minute, you're making me feel bad. - Oh my god, he's coming in hot. (engine whirring) - [Doug] Get ready to land. (metal clanking) - Almost. - [Group] Yeah. - We're on the ground, we survive. - [Person] Our next plane is the $1,000 first class plane ticket. - But here's the thing, boys. I bought all the first class seats, so, sit wherever you want. - Would you like some miracle mist lotion? - Why? - Because first class, baby, fine dining, huh. - [Person] Each of us has our own seat and TV. The ticket also comes with a decent meal, a free bag of toiletries and pajamas. - Do we get to take all this home with us - [Person] And during longer flights... - Recline. We should recline into a bed. - I feel like I'm in a coffin, which I like. - Yeah, this is crazy. - [Person] And best of all... - My favorite part about this $1,000 plane, I don't need to speak to Nolan. - I don't like this glass 'cause it like separates me. I'm all alone back here. - That is the exact reason why I like it. - [Person] The only downside is that you don't get a lot of privacy. - [Chris] It's really awkward filming a video with all these people walking by. - [Person] So, let's see what a plane ticket 10 times more expensive will feel like. - And now, the $10,000 plane ticket. Oh man, this is nice. I have unlimited legroom here. Look, let's start off by analyzing what we get. A tablet, a giant touchscreen TV, my own in-seat drink bar, snacks. This isn't Feastables chocolate. I want a refund. - We're getting connected to the Wi-Fi. We might have paid $10,000 for our seat but we still have to pay $20 for Wi-Fi. - It's not free? - Now, we're taking off, which is pretty crazy because I can literally watch it on my TV and because it's a 16-hour flight, I get to take a... Look at how nice this bathroom is. You have a sink, a toilet, and then a shower. That is crazy. Look at that. We are 30,000 feet in the air and I can take a shower - [Person] On top of that, me and the boys can order as much gourmet food as we want. And that's not all, we save the best for last. - Hey, how's it going? - [Person] There's a private lounge in the back of the plane. - Hey, Jimmy. - Yeah. - Ow. - You're not dreaming. - That was the $10,000 plane ticket. Point the camera up and down. And now we're at the $25,000 plane ticket that is up these stairs. That's right, there's floors. - This is insane. - This is crazy. We're gonna be sitting above other people. - Oh my god. - Now, this is your room. - [Person] For $25,000, you get two massive rooms. - Oh, this is crazy. I've never seen anything like this. - Holy... - [Person] Our space on this plane is literally four times bigger than the last one. I've never seen a plane where I can comfortably do jumping jacks. Look at this. - [Person] We also get two chairs, a ton of TVs. - There are more TVs in this one room than all of the other planes we've been on - [Person] Food served by a personal flight attendant. - Why is it that after a certain price point, they always give you a caviar? - And the bathroom. - Can we talk about something? This bathroom is like a disappointment. No shower, no heated floors, half the size. I think the $10,000 flight was a better price point. - Would you pay this kind of money for a single flight? - I wouldn't recommend this. I would recommend a car. - Buy a car instead. - And now, the best part of the room, a queen size bed. Ooh. - Why don't they just make every seat a bed? - Bro, instead of three seats side by side, just put a bunk bed with three bed. (bright music) (audio squeaks) (hand thudding) - Good morning. That was really good sleep. - Karl, wake up. We're gonna land. - I slept like a rock. That was the world's most expensive commercial flight. Time for private flights. (screen whooshing) This is the $100,000 plane. - This thing's huge. - At this price point, you get the entire plane. (group cheering indistinctly) - Private, private. - Oh, it's like a yacht. - This is wild. - This is unbelievable. - You wanna know the craziest part? This is just one of four rooms. - [Karl] There's more to the plane, I thought this was it. - Guys, come over here. What room is this? - [Person] This is literally another lounge area with a bunch of snacks and a huge TV. And if you're feeling tired, you get your own private bedroom. - Dude, what? Wee. - This is like a hotel. - [Person] And last but not least, the bathroom. - Three, shut your mouth right now. Shut it. - Whoa. - This is insane. There's a seat in the bathroom. Dibs - Have you ever even seen a jet half this size? - No. - Never. - What do we talk about while on our private jet? - Well, I'll tell you, last year I had sold the (indistinct). - Oh no. Oh, wait. I just realized I'm taking off backwards (water bottle thuds) (GoPro thuds) - Whoa. - GoPro. - I didn't realize we were taking off. - Not the camera. Stop! - This is crazy. Whoa, oh. (Karl whistling) (group laughing) - Bro flew. - Oh my God. (person laughing) - I can just roll back. - Oh, turbulence. All right, I'm going to sit down. - This might be the best bathroom yet. This is the toilet. On the toilet you can watch TV. - Hey, Nolan, I hope you feel comfortable in the bathroom. - What's going on? I'm so confused. (door thuds) No, no. (laughs) - He's never getting out. - (gasps) What? - Oh wow. - I have steak, mashed potatoes, and veggies. And you guys inspired me a little bit, so I brought some pizza. - [Group] Yeah! (upbeat music) - This is my favorite plane because it has YouTube but we didn't pop up first, so now, it's not. - You can tell this is a rich person bed 'cause there's like 500 pillows. This one outta here. That one outta here. (singer sings in foreign language) - I'm gonna fly this thingy. - And that's the beauty of flying private. You can do whatever you want whenever. Karl's flying the plane, Chandler's jamming out the pizza. Chris is taking a nap and I don't even know where Nolan went. There's no layovers when you fly private and there's no TSA, so you save tons of time. Hence why? Basically, every rich person you know owns a private jet. - Hey, guys. - Yeah. - We're gonna land soon. - Karl, let me out. (hand thudding) - Where about... We're gonna land? You gotta let me out, bro. - Oh, oh. - Oh my God. That was the opposite smooth. - Wait, wait. Is Nolan still in the bathroom? - I don't know, really. - Karl, go let him out. - Oh, oh. - How was your flight? - Still better than the $1000 plane. (Karl laughing) - And now, the $300,000 blimp. I'll unblur it in a second. Before I remove your blindfolds, what do you think is on the side of the blimp? - Is it Nolan's phone number? - Did you do Nolan's phone number? - That would be funny. - Next time. - Take off your blindfolds. Turn turnaround. (person scream) (MrBeast laughs) (group laughing) - I heart Karl's mom. Hold up. Why? He really loves my mom. - No, Karl, he hearts your mom. He doesn't love your mom. That'd be weird. - No, I love her. - Oh. (blowing raspberries) - [Chandler] Dude, am I pushing it right now? - Ooh, it's like moving. - This giant aircraft can literally just be pulled by a rope. And you might be wondering how did I afford this giant blimp and pay six figures to wrap it? ZipRecruiter, a recruiting platform that I use to hire people like editors, cameramen, and accountants. Let's see if it stops floating when I get on it. (metal stairs thuds) - That's gains, dude. - Does that mean I'm fat? - It means you work out a lot. - Or I'm fat. ZipRecruiter is where people go to discover their next great job. If this blimp crashes, then I die. - Uh-huh. - You guys could just use ZipRecruiter to find a new job. - That'll make it so much easier. Thanks, man. - I feel like I don't like this conversation. - Shh, shh. All right, let's do this. Goodbye, Chandler. Goodbye, forever. (door thuds) - I think I heard forever. - [Chris] He could have promoted anything and he chose Karl's mom. - I'm terrified. This ain't picking up speed. - Well, we'll see you at the race. - [Person] Oh, and I forgot to mention, we're flying this blimp over 150,000 people at the world's largest race car event. And Karl has no idea. - Before I die in this blimp, I wanna tell you guys about ZipRecruiter. We recently made a job posting on ZipRecruiter and I'm gonna call one of the candidates and interview them. (phone ringing) Hey, Thomas. I saw your application on ZipRecruiter. Can you hear me? - [Thomas] Yes, I can. Is this MrBeast? - Yeah, I'm MrBeast, it doesn't matter. - [Thomas] Sorry, I can't barely hear you right now. - Yeah, because we're on a blimp. How long have you been an editor for? - [Thomas] I've been an editor for about 10 years. - Do you think you can improve our videos? - [Thomas] I think with a strong team and a little creative innovation, I can definitely make your videos better. - Okay, not bad. Send me some examples of your work. If like Thomas, you want a shot to come work for us, click the link in the description or go to ziprecruiter.com/mrbeast. We're gonna look at every single person that applies. (crowd cheering) (cars revving) We are now over the Daytona 500 which is one of the busiest events ever. - [Karl] You couldn't have put something better on the blimp. - No, this is perfect. - This is wrong. (laughing) - [Chris] Can they see us? - [MrBeast] You can see 'em. (screen dings) - Karl, I can confirm. Everyone loves your mom down here. - I love Karl's mom. - Everybody's like, \"We love...\" - [Crowd] I love Karl's mom. - Karl's mom, if you're watching, you're a lovely lady. - [Crowd] We love Karl's mom. - [Karl] You're a psycho. - [MrBeast] For your mom. (audio thuds) - [Person] And now, the most expensive private plane ticket on the planet. (upbeat music) - Hi, welcome board. I suggest you taking your shoes off. That carpet's actually $2 million. - She's like, \"I suggest it, really hard.\" - [MrBeast] And by square feet, this is bigger than our houses. - [Person] It's almost impossible to imagine how big this jet actually is. - Right here is a bedroom. - Wow. - A bedroom. Another bedroom, another bedroom. Keep going. This is for the crew, another bedroom. - Hoo! - What'd you find? - My dibs? - [Person] The bedrooms on this plane are way more extravagant. Gold plated sinks, multiple showers. - Wait, what's in there? - That's the toilet. - [Person] This plane comes with its own theater room, a lounge that can seat it up to 12 people. - [MrBeast] And then over here is the living room. - This is like a bigger couch than what I have in my house. - I just want you to know you've only seen a third of the plane so far. - There's more. - [Chris] What? Oh, got some good stuff. - You can call flight attendants in your bedroom. - If we could do this every time we fly, I'd live in the air. Whoa, whoa, what is that? - Sorry, I'm turning the lights on and off. - How did I miss this room? Like we walked around the whole plane - And in case you thought you saw everything, there's also massages on this plane. How is it, Karl? - It's amazing. - So, I really just shouldn't. (glass shattering) (Chris giggling) - Gentlemen, how were we able to afford this plane? - I would say only our fans. - [Person] And because of that, we invited a bunch of random subscribers on this half a million-dollar plane ride. - Have you ever flown on a private jet before? - No. This is my first time. - And it's the most expensive one on the planet. - I've never seen anything like this on a plane. Like this is crazy. - Ma'am, what is this right here? - That's gas station chocolate. - Can you just throw it? Okay. (chocolates thudding) - I didn't think she'd literally throw 'em. (stewardess laughs) This is the chocolate you need to serve from now on, okay? - Got it. It's called Feastables, It's the highest rated chocolate on the planet. - [Karl] What the heck is over this way? - [Chris] Yo, this gotta be a secret room. That's where the crew is. We just got a bunch of funny looks. (chuckles) - Attention, boys. We're about to take off. Fasten your seat belts, stop being hooligans. Thank you. (head thuds) (Nolan screams) (group laughs) Typically, what kind of people fly on a plane like this? - Business people. How do my dumb friends compare? - It's pretty dumb, I guess, I'd say. (MrBeast laughs) - [Person] At this price point, they serve the highest quality food anytime you want it and anywhere on the plane. Even in your own private master suite. - You want some? (audio smooching) (group laughing) - Do you guys even know where we're going? - [Group] No. - We're taking you all to Disney World and we're gonna give you two days of all expense paid trips to do whatever you want. (group indistinctly cheering) - No way. - So, if you wanna fly on the most expensive jet in the world and then spend two days all paid for in Disney World, subscribe. \u266a My life \u266a \u266a 'Cause of I'm baller for the rest of my life \u266a \u266a Yeah, yeah \u266a \u266a My life, my life, my life \u266a"

that's happy with their life what happened it's a homeless guy for a long time I was sad about my situation and one day I read a quote that really stuck with me and said the reason most of us aren't happy is because we obsess so much over all the things that we don't have that we forget to appreciate the things that's true that's a beautiful quote but I'm not trying to be mean at all how can you be grateful for anything I mean you're homeless and I'd have a roof over my head but I have a blanket and a pillow I'm thankful for that I'm in La where the weather's always nice finally we've got

love you so much man I love you I thank you for taking a leap with me on this and for putting together this unbelievable band to Hagar Guillermo Tim and Steve I could never have imagined it would have been this great and over the past few years Ian you were you were I can't look at you while I say this if that's all right you Ian you were the second writer that we hired on this show and from the

because both of you your work your dedication your your precision and your skill has been incredible and I can't thank you both enough um we are very very lucky to be on a network like CBS I cannot express how fantastic they have been with me from day one it's unfathomable why they took a chance on me to do this job I will never understand it but they have supported and they have loved this show and I will be forever grateful for what they've done for me and my family it's been uh it's been life-changing it really has because moving here to America moving here to America eight years ago it was a huge leap for me my family my son was three her daughter was 12 weeks old and we now have another small person and she's American yeah we uh you know we started this show we started with Obama then Trump then a global pandemic and and I've watched I've watched America change a lot over these past few years I've watched I've watched divisions grow and and I've seen and I've felt a sense of negativity bubble and it points boil over and I guess all I really want to say tonight is I implore you to remember what America signifies to the rest of the world my entire life it has always been a place of optimism and joy and yes it has flaws so many but show me a country that doesn't show me a person that doesn't me you all of us we are all trying to figure this out we are every single one of us a work in progress and just because somebody disagrees with you it doesn't make them bad or evil we are all more the same than we are different and there are so many people there are so many people who are who are trying to stoke those differences and we have to try as best we can to look for the light look for the joy because if you do it's out there and that's all this show has ever been about all we've ever wanted is just be a little a little bit of light and levity at the end of your day thank you for letting me do this thank you for letting me into your home every night I've never taken for granted what an absolute privilege this has been now look when we come back when we come back you are gonna be absolutely shocked at how we are going to end this show guess what we're going to end with a song I know what are the chances come on back everybody [Applause] [Music] now the last guest has gone from the Green Room and our last conversation is done the final rehearsal is over and the final commercial has run no more late late Tinder for swiping no more torturous games for a laugh no more risking my life on a fighter jet or learning too much about our staff squeezing myself into Spanx every night for 1200 times in a row so good night thanks for watching that's our show [Music] [Applause] lost karaoke's been coupled and we all came along for the right the Lost spill your Cuts has been swallowed and I'm still feeling nauseous inside and soon I will head home to London but I'll sure miss it here in L.A the weather my friends and those micro green salads I claim that I eat every day and Reggie will no longer ask people questions that aren't the least bit apropos what is the nature of time as always night thanks for watching it's our show that's our show that producers directors designers the ones who set the lights and answer phones and do the edit writing sketches working cameras building Graphics making costumes booking Talent mixing sound and never getting any

just for you so you saw all the rooms it's time to make a decision whichever room you like the most just walk straight in go to the favorite room here she goes in your face I didn't like it she likes

      "corpus": "in this video I'm going to customize a ton of Louis Vuitton bags and then I'm going to surprise Travis Barker with them that's sick I love that first thing we're going to start with is this suitcase whoa it's so big wow wow I'm scared of paint on this I've surprised people with a lot of customized bags in the past but I want these to top all of them I'm very nervous to just go in on this so I think before I start painting I'm going to do a little rough sketch Ben want to grab me my iPad Zach's iPad not yours thanks after doing some stalking on Instagram I found a design that I thought Travis Barker would really like it's time to get started not gonna lie I'm a little worried because you can't remove paint from a Louis Vuitton bag without destroying it so once I started painting there was no turning back alright so here's the base sketch there's Travis Parker's name on here a lot of Plushies that are kind of like falling apart with stuffing coming out so we should be able to start filling it in with paint now after blocking in the colors I could finally start to see the piece come together I hope Travis thinks these are amazing because he's going on tour soon and I thought it would be super cool to surprise him with custom luggage that he can take with him I need to get some professional opinion before I get too far in the scrunchie show that is freaking sick I'm gonna move on to some outlines and I want you to do the honors and get the first lines in don't smear anything please that was actually pretty good and I gave him the idea of putting drumsticks on the piece so it's basically a collaboration I like it so far this is definitely one of my best pieces right now Zach's piece looks like straight garbage with that being said I think the bag is finished it's time to seal it in wait if you guys have any once we seal it it's too late let's go Travis Barker wrong wait I didn't miss something we'll be right back we'll be right back so final step is to add this thing which seals all the paint in I'm hoping this doesn't mess anything up because last time when we tried to seal in the sweaters for 17 it was a big disaster and we restarted that was the worst experience of my life we have no time to restart so this either works or we're probably scrapping the video oh it smells so bad [Music] [Music] that looks really nice good this next scene is going to be really cool okay and we are finished we're finished with the first bag and we still have a backpack purses more I already messed it up ah whatever let's go to the next scene for the second bag it is going to be a Louis Vuitton backpack so whenever I'm painting nice items the beginning is always the hardest part so just to start we're gonna keep it simple I have a brush with paint on it I'm gonna close my eyes and all right there we started it that was scary after working on the backpack for a little bit I noticed my friends were starting to get bored so I decided to give them a challenge so in front of each one of you guys is a Louis Vuitton item you will have 90 minutes to customize it best one keeps it the rest are given away everyone clap the bags are hidden around the studio someone touched that clock I feel like one of them would be in here so it'll take me home 30 minutes to find this thing I found it I knew it Zach hides things in high places wait these are so nice I I kind of want one now this is like the most expensive thing I'm ever gonna paint on oh wait we painted a house yay I'm the last one and can we just take a moment to appreciate the sets look how pretty this is I actually got inspired by one of blackpink's music videos for the black and white set it's up here [Music] ah here it is all right so as you guys can see I have the base layer down over here and the design is actually pretty simple there's going to be a couple rips in the bag like fake painted rips and right now I just have to wait for it to dry and in the meantime I'm gonna go check out my friend's paintings Michelle's careful you have some paint on your hands I don't I don't want you to accidentally get it on though oh I did look I accidentally got it all over the wallet but that's okay Benjamin Ben just smeared some paint right here this is a result of not being careful what really I see that Mackenzie is doing a Lo-Fi tiger no I think it looks pretty good on camera Jake let me see it so far whoa interesting all right well you guys have around 20 minutes left so pick it up I'm in the zone I'm feeling good about this which actually reminded me of something I really wanted to tell you oh time's up all right everyone stop what you're doing can I see your keys yes it is a bird on a treble clef tree branch this is a dragon as a music note with a couple sound waves in the back this is my tiger I heard you say it was for your mom yep yep uh the scales are music notes oh I can kind of see it so only one of you guys will get to keep yours and I'm gonna let my subscribers decide who keeps it oh no the voting took a while and I know you're just gonna skip ahead so I'm gonna skip ahead for you so the winner of this mini Challenge and the person that gets to keep their custom Louis Vuitton wallet is Mackenzie Mackenzie congratulations this beautiful Louis Vuitton wallet is yours for the rest of you guys you guys don't get to keep it if you want these hit that subscribe button right now and you could win one of these three comment if you want the birds so I'm about done with this backpack design now comes the fun part where we get to seal it off if Zach wanted to paint five more Louis Vuitton suitcases I would be more than happy to have one I already have two okay okay well you don't know Luke I'm all done I need honest opinions do you think Travis sparker will like it thank you yes you guys aren't lying because you're my friends never yeah I think when Travis sees these pieces he's gonna be like bottom to paint for Travis Barker so apparently this is called a little messenger bag it's a man and Michelle remember how I told you I have something special for you yeah well we bought an extra item this is for his wife I'm painting Kourtney Kardashian this is yours to design for her so you're gonna do a nice little design at the front I do need a new bag maybe Zach will surprise me next time with it too right back I can't believe Zach's giving me the opportunity to paint for the Kourtney Kardashian maybe I should practice I'll practice on here first okay this is my first attempt it kind of looks like a flower but it also looks like a maze I don't want her to think it's ugly and never wear it this is my third time changing my idea but now I will do a branch of flowers [Music] I'd say I'm proud of you are you trying and not giving up yes okay he hates it probably touched this up add a couple more Design Elements and it's gonna look really nice if only she likes Birds I can do birds can someone just start up the time lapse my team spent a few hours touching it up and now we're ready to show Michelle the final product [Music] those painting oh that looks so much better and after days of work we're on the final bag my creative juices are starting to run low I'm not gonna lie I'm starting to get a little too exhausted to keep doing these voiceovers transition so here's the progress I've made on this bag so far and I looked at one of Travis Barker's tattoos and there was a skull with roses I drew the skull but it's missing some roses I decided to get a realistic rose expert to do that so do you want to do those Roses right there yeah so I'm not an expert it'll be fine [Music] okay Mackenzie I I heard you're done yes yes let's see it here you go nice drop with the Roses I like it now that we're done with that let's take the tape off that's really good wait you should put it all on so he's gonna have a bag like this suitcase backpack drippy Geo do you want to do like a cool Montage of all three of these before we give it to him let's go now that all the bags are finished we've lost them up and flew to Travis's Studio these have made it safely and while we're waiting for Travis to show up I think his team is going to give us a tour which is really exciting it looks really cool here this is my giant bunny friend oh this is the recording this is so cool I feel like I'm like at a museum and I can't touch anything walking around Travis Barker Studio reminded me of my childhood friend Dan some of you OG fans might remember him from some of her old videos yep that's him showing his butt Dennis also a drummer and has always been a huge fan of Travis Barker so while I'm here I'm gonna see if I can bring something back for him their team just gave us some of his drumsticks that we can get signed later and I'm gonna see if I can get them signed for Dan as you guys can see we have Travis Barker over here we have some gifts for you so we we have three different bags for you so here's the first one for this one we got a bit of inspiration from one of your tattoos actually oh cool oh that's incredible I love that you have a skull on the side of my head yeah skull in the middle of it that's amazing wow you're really talented oh thank you so this one is a backpack do you ever get really nervous when you're about to draw on them or can you like erase like how do you delete um if you start I can't so once I start I I just need to you just correct it with more sort of yeah wow oh that's super cool I love that I know you're uh going on tour soon so this is a suitcase with some art on it that hopefully you can bring on your tour Okay cool so yeah yeah this is a bigger one so this one I was very nervous to paint on yeah oh wow that's sick I love that yeah so we have a lot of characters on there and maybe characters you always draw a few of them and then the other ones kind of just like made up I love this guy chilling on the symbol yeah so good these are amazing and then we have a little gift for your wife Michelle designed it and we just touched it up a little bit really cool yeah why you guys love that I already know you drew it uh I designed it you did that's really nice Yes she'll love this this is about like the size purse she needs to carry all the time too she likes a really small purse or wallet oh awesome yeah this is incredible yeah

      "corpus": "today I bought every band item in America that we can get our hands on some of these products were from the 90s before I was born but they were discontinued recalled or banned for a specific reason let's dive into it starting off with the iconic Easy Bake Oven this was a huge part of my childhood pretty much taught kids how to actually bake it actually came with real ingredients with a real oven for you to cook and actually eat as a kid I know myself as a kid I always wanted to cook but my mom wouldn't let me so this is what it was made for so easy bake actually came out in 1963 but it wasn't until the 2006 version that something went horribly wrong for them to ban it and this is the exact one we got our hands on so many children actually got injured from this product because they would burn themselves and one incident that happened is a girl got her finger caught in the oven door and she had to amputate her finger so they recalled over 900 000 of these Easy Bake Ovens but dude this is so nostalgic look at this yeah I wonder if it's actually gonna work look at that you literally put the food in there let it cook I don't think I could actually eat this because whatever it came with is probably expired oh it comes with mints that's cool I low-key don't know if this is supposed to come with it or the person we bought this from just threw these I think that's what happened so back in 2006 you can get your hands on one of these bad boys for 25 but we actually had to pay 127 just to get our hands on it because it is banned so it's hard to find this is what you put the food in stick it straight into the oven no do you think it's gonna work no the basic beginning set real baking tools to use with your Easy Bake Oven a little whisk bro what so sadly it didn't come with any of the baking ingredients I mean it would make sense why because this is from 2006 and it was used but we're just gonna see if it actually still turns on oh there it is the light turned on I think this is what kids would get their fingers stuck in I would be the type to injure myself right now bro we do smell that it's actually on it smells old it smells like old cookies were baked in here so it actually still does work I wish we had the baking mix to actually make something I probably wouldn't have tried it but would have been cool to see it cook but guys nowadays Easy Bake made an updated version a safer version and it's good to know that they're still going from launching from 1963. they still have their brand 60 years later next product we have our blow pens every time I'd be watching SpongeBob this commercial would play these came out in 1995 and the reason they got discontinued was simply due to the fact that people just wanted to draw regularly with their hands and not load through a marker that's what the product does you pretty much draw by blowing into the pen obviously you would think that it got discontinued because it was dangerous but as you can see up here it says it's washable and non-toxic we're gonna open these up I think it comes with a stencil this is what they look like no way I have this in my hands we got a flower stencil right here so this is how you set it up so it's ready to use you pop this open you take this out and you can see it's like a regular marker but you're going to want to turn it put it in this way and you lock it in like that and this is where you blow from so let's see if it works a little bit came out no weights this hard I don't know if I don't know if the product is old but if it was really this hard back in the day to do it I could see why no one wanted to do this let me try another one I'm about to pass out guys I kind of want to see if I draw out the marker if it's still there yeah like it still works all right guys I finally figured out how to do it after practicing so here we go perfect yo this is actually sick that it still works all right you ready to see it oh this is sick what Loki gives off a sick aesthetic look at that how fire is that okay I love this product I don't know how the hype died down I thought it was fire but let's move on to the next product the next one is Altoids Tangerine sours these were my childhood candy everyone in my school would have these they were really wildly popular and as you can see on the back they were 1.69 and this one was specifically an O3 but they got discontinued the reason for that is that they were really popular yet they had very low sales we were able to get our hands on them you could buy them for 1.69 back then we got them for 200 so that just shows how hard it is to get your hands on them we're gonna open it up right here I remember they always used to be stuck to each other in the can so I wonder 20 years of them being in this pack how it's gonna look I know guys I'm not gonna eat them and yes guys I know I look like nectar from Despicable Me right now I get it look at that bro you could already see like it has like goo it's like slimy oh my gosh bro no way it still smells like them low-key yo wait look at how melted this is yo we're gonna pop up a picture of what they're actually supposed to look like the fact that I could still smell them is so nostalgic to me bro so what's crazy is these were hard candies but have you guys ever seen hard candy melt I'd understand if it was like a gummy worm or gummy bear would be melted but a hard candy I guess maybe because it's been 20 years I don't know let me know what you guys think next item we have is the Hannah Montana Pop Star card game and this got completely banned due to the amount of lead that was in these cards there is 75 times more lead in these cards than the legal limit which caused them to get banned how do cards have that much lead for those who don't know lead is a toxic metal that can actually lead to death so the fact that you can possibly die by playing a card game is crazy I'm just wearing gloves just in case all right this is it the pop star card game don't get me wrong Hannah Montana was literally my biggest crush of all time but this product is deadly bro never even heard about these cards when I was a huge Hannah Montana fan we got Jackson as the choker Hannah Lily and then wait where's Rico where's my twin bro he better be in this game Montana as if he wasn't an important character that disrespect is crazy bro so these are the actual cards right here there's a lot of trivia I guarantee you bro I will get a lot of these right the name of the custodian at Miley's Middle School who customizes Jake Ryan's Locker is Tony yeah okay if you're a fan of Hannah Montana back in the day I feel like there's a pretty solid card game but since they disrespected my boy Rico and they didn't have him in here I don't like this game so this was the Barbie rollerblade Edition that released in early 1991 and got banned in late 1991. it didn't even last one year before they banned it from the dangers that this doll caused you can even tell from the box look at how old that is bro it kind of has like a yellow tint to it do you see it up to 10 rebate details inside offer expires 1993. so it didn't even make it to that the reason it actually got banned is that you can actually create Sparks from the blades it was a danger Hazard for burning little kids or starting a fire hopefully we don't start a fire out here I'm excited to see if it actually works I don't even want to damage the Box because it's from 1991. this is it what does this say it says allow four to six weeks for your skates to arrive then let the good times roll again oh after a short period of time the skates lose their Sizzle you could actually order a new pair of skates that's pretty cool these are it right here let's try it out do you see any Sparks no I'm gonna try doing it with just one skate it's like lighting a match bro oh I feel a little bit no way yeah I saw one I didn't even see it see that okay I can definitely see why they got banned because they were literally causing actual Sparks this is surge which is pretty much Coca-Cola's version of Mountain Dew but the reason it got discontinued is that it just didn't do well and could not compete with the real Mountain Dew I don't think anything can Top Mountain Dew surge tried many ways of trying to stay relevant stay popping they did a collab with Amazon Burger King but it just didn't hit they just ended up discontinuing the whole thing and now that I'm reading the back of this it says there's 56 grams of sugar bro that is wildly unhealthy I personally have never even tried surge I remember seeing them try to promote it I always used to buy stuff that I'd seen commercials but this one for some reason I just didn't want to buy so we all know Serge got discontinued but no you know what's not discontinued what chug rug oh okay see like I was supposed to make it in the Chug rub can but I just suck well I want to smell it now wait it literally smells exactly like Mountain Dew but guys this is the perfect time for you to try chug rug or any other G fuel flavor because they are running the spring buy one get one free sale check out the link in the description G fuel spring BOGO so this book right here is called the 48 Laws of Power this isn't banned in America it's just banned throughout the entire prison system in America so no one in prison no one in jail can ever get their hands on this the reason to that is because this book teaches people how to manipulate others you don't want a prisoner wanting to learn that because they can manipulate the guards or other prisoners I want to read you guys some of the chapters because they're kind of crazy one of them says make other people come to you use bait if necessary I mean that's highly manipulative play on people's need to believe to create a cult-like following bro what is this book dude I mean I totally understand why we don't want this in prisoner's hands get others to do the work for you but always take the credit what bro this this is scary man how is this even a good book for you to read in general just morally mentally I don't know why you'd want to learn how to be manipulative because manipulative people are literally the scariest people on planet Earth this is the cabin Dairy Cream Egg and you will never find an authentic version of these in America as these were imported from the UK the reason these were banned in America is because Hershey's filed a lawsuit against them because of how similar these were to an already existing Hershey's chocolate egg but if you're from the UK you've probably seen these all over since they're not expired I can actually give this one a try I'm really excited well look at the filling these are fired what the heck the only thing is I haven't seen Hershey's drop a similar chocolate to this at all on the topic of chocolate we have the Kinder Surprise egg which was banned in 1997. and in fact it was so hard for us to get our hands on it the only version we could get is the Spanish version straight from Mexico this actually got banned because it was a choking hazard for kids in the egg they would put a plastic toy in there and some kids wouldn't know that so they put the whole egg in their mouth and try to swallow it and actually choked on the toy we're gonna open this one up I think one of the first chocolates I've ever eaten in my life my parents brought it from Jordan it was Kinder but it was just like the OG Kinder bars and we would always refrigerate them okay no you want some no wow dude they're cute man you could hear the toy in there I'm opening it up there it is right there but I guess the toys in here definitely a cool concept though what is this you could build a snowman Bro Look at that all right we built my snowman and now taste test really good this game X-Men Destiny was released in 2011 and banned in 2014. so there were some legal issues going on between two game companies and funny enough one of those companies was epic games due to all that drama all that beef they ended up destroying every last copy of X-Men Destiny except the few that people actually had at their house so so I'm holding one of the very last few copies of this game just imagine all the literal Blood Sweat and Tears put into creating a new video game and just three years later it got taken away from you due to just some legal issues I can't even imagine that feeling I personally have never played this game but it's on the Wii we have a plane over here I actually wanted to play the game but supposedly you need like Wii nunchucks to even start the game so we were able to get the loading screen going but it's such a shame that this went to waste this I actually remember it's called a Sky Dancer and it was released in 1994 but got banned in 2000 for some severe reasons I personally remember the commercials we're gonna have it playing right now so pretty much you just pull this right here and it starts spinning and it launches but due to the dangers of it hitting people's face it caused temporary blindness to some people and people having to get stitches which is absolutely crazy causing Sky Dancers to get completely banned from America and they have to recall 9 million units here we go imma launch it damn yo that's still sick though but I could see how dangerous it could be for kids I don't know if you guys seen this video of a young girl opening this for Christmas and she launched it into their own fireplace I could see how that could be addicting I feel like this is fun but at the end of the day safety comes first so for this water rocket this isn't the exact one that got banned in 1997. it was only on the market for three months April 1997 to July 1997. the real one that got banned was actually even almost impossible to find a picture on Google from it that's how short-lived it was it was extremely dangerous because it would launch into people's eyes and the plastic was super weak that when they fill it up with a hose it would explode and all the plastic pieces would cut people's faces for this specific one right here it literally says not recommended for children under eight years old always aim rocket so it is launched straight up never pointed at people or buildings and also it says made from high-tech shatter resistant plastic because obviously of the original one they decided to take more safety precautions these are the three pieces we have I'm excited to see how high it actually launches because supposedly it says right here it could launch up to 100 feet but I doubt it I think that's cap first things first to get the water in the rocket it comes with this funnel and we're gonna try to make it launch a hundred feet we got the safety goggles on just in case we have the pump and we are going to lock it in just like that now it's locked in and now it says to pump at about 20 to 25 times and then I pull this lock ring and it's supposed to shoot up 100 feet in the air one two look at that three four five six seven eight it's creating bubbles ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen Seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty I'm just gonna do that twenty Ready Set that was like 20 feet what the heck guys pump the like button just as much as I'm pumping this water rocket this one's gonna go high all right I would say shot up to like 20 25 feet I think that's a cool product but definitely could see how the old one could shatter when you're pumping and actually injure people all right guys for the last band product we have the Cabbage Patch Kids snack time and as you can see I'm in a whole different outfit because this took way longer than any band product we found just because of how hard it was to find this was actually launched in 1996 and banned one year later in 1997 because this Cabbage Patch Kid actually eats like it moves its mouth it has a mechanic that eats toys right here it says fun snacks you could feed it but the problem was that kid's hair was getting caught in the jaw of the Cabbage Patch Kid and it just would not stop chewing leading to the parent having to cut the hair and other injuries so that's pretty crazy I mean it literally says right here for ages over three years but sadly it didn't last too long it's just crazy knowing I have a box here from 1996. we got this set up we had to put two C batteries in there and it actually still works look at this if it detects something it just starts chewing look at how creepy that looks I feel like this is gonna haunt me after this video we're gonna get some of the food it came with let's get some french fries you know you hungry so she'll chew they actually fall in her backpack once it's done I mean it's a really great concept of a toy back in the 90s of course but obviously if it's dangerous it's not good no way hold up it's right here dude that's actually sick so we got a wig right here this toy was made for children over three so you would imagine a kid at that age would like put their finger in her mouth or something and then once they get the mouth moving if they accidentally get their hair caught in that as you can see it's pulling the hair look at that your hair is now stuck to where your parent would have to just cut your hair and that's what caused it to be bam look at that like it's genuinely stuck oh that's awful that is awful guys comment down below which band product you thought was the most interesting and I will see you all with the next video peace"

be here tonight everyone is looking so stylish ah thank you thank you so as we all know Matt Franco is really sick when it comes to cards and I too love cards so much so that I brought my own deck and this next trick will blow your socks off because I have a deck of socks okay you'll notice as I continue dealing through the cards here that every single pair of socks do not match now wouldn't it be amazing Simon and Heidi if you both chose the only matching pair of socks how cool would that be impossible Simon will start with you okay what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna deal through the cards here and can you just tell me when to stop whenever you want please foreign [Laughter] great so Heidi yes it's your turn now once I'm gonna do I'm gonna I'm gonna pick the next one well this one here yeah all right you happy yeah yep all right great let's take that one don't look at it great so you would all of these options here and you guys chose them two cards this is the big moment the first time hopefully then two cards match show everyone they don't actually no that's such a shame Oh I thought we all had a connection like that's so embarrassing that's more embarrassing than you trying to ride a bike I I don't know what to do actually hold up the two pairs of socks again High ease yours like purple with some stars and Simons you're just like yellow and green that's interesting because actually if we take a look at the socks I chose to wear for tonight's performance [Music] [Applause] your shoes for me as well oh come on now [Applause] one thing though Aiden I I kind of have to tell you I'm not surprised that Heidi's and Simon socks didn't match because you showed in the beginning none of the socks match you know what we could do with a little bit of teamwork yep I see um on a snap of the fingers you can get not only the first character much or the second or come on every single part of my truck to now completely lost which means YouTube Just wait a second hold on wait I think I noticed you had like a little strange mark on the bottom of your foot there could you show me that on that sock yellow yeah is that is that a red eight Howie in the beginning you thought of any card can you hold that up it was the eight of Hearts check it out [Applause] we're done [Applause] amazing Aiden McCann and Matt Franco so Aiden how do you think Matt did Matt did amazing I mean I still have a lot to teach you but of course you did great big thanks to both of you you can catch Matt in his very own magic show in Las Vegas magic reinvented nightly at the link hotel and casino one more time for Aiden McCann and Matt Franco so the first thing that we're going to do Heidi if you could please join me on stage along with Terry give it up for Heidi Klum and Terry Crews everybody hey thank you for joining us great to see you again good to see you so um look magic can be many things I'm Heidi Keepers hold your hand out like this yes as a magician um with these hands I can do some pretty impossible things wow but look there's a magic that is far more powerful than anything these hands could ever do our words can literally change the course of someone's entire future ah Terry I need to do me a favor I want you to think of some encouraging words that you might want to say to Simon okay something that might impact him in a way that matters I want you to imagine yourself writing down whatever it is you're thinking on a note for Simon cool right awesome um Simon do you see this uh blank piece of paper in front of you yep can you please pick that up yep I'm gonna pick it up hold it in front of you keep your eyes on the paper Terry continue to imagine yourself writing down whatever it is you're thinking and um Simon as Terry is imagining this do you notice anything happening yep to that paper the words are becoming clearer Terry there's no way that anybody could know what you're thinking I don't want you to say what you're thinking exactly but um can you just tell us what it's about fatherhood fatherhood um Simon can you please read out loud the note that Terry just wrote for you yeah Simon you're an amazing father to Eric never forget that is that what you're thinking wow wow our words can literally become reality words are powerful but words are not always encouraging when I was a little kid I had this belief deep inside me that I had the ability to impact the lives of others in a way that mattered and then I met a lady who always felt the need to remind me that the only thing that I had was ADHD a minor version of Tourette's and a whole lot of people who had no idea what to do with me what could this anxious unfocused kid possibly do to change the world how could I impact lives in a way that mattered when I didn't even matter her words created a barrier that I couldn't see past and I didn't think I would ever be able to break through but then uh fast forward to when I was about 18 years old I met a man named Keith whose words also changed me uh Keith became a mentor to me and day after day he would speak words to me that reminded me of who I really was um Terry Heidi I want to I want to show you guys something if you guys could each grab a piece of this hold this up right there maybe with your other hand tear you up that hand Heidi hold it yep right there look Keith single-handedly reached into my life and removed every negative word that I ever believed about myself his words helped me break through this barrier that I thought I would be stuck behind forever [Music] one person one person to take on these words and remind me that I matter this is why it never felt like it was me who won America's Got Talent it was an eight-year-old boy who believed that he would never be anything he won America's Got Talent [Applause] so much I mean wow you've done it again you really have I mean every time when you come you serve you really do I mean that was like another genius perfect performance there's been a movement of magicians who not only are doing magic and dazzling us and entertaining us but they're also Inspire and motivate and you do that beautifully in these very relatable stories deserve the win that you had on AGT you deserve to be here at all stars and we can't thank you enough for this performance yes yes all unique and you're very believable I would argue that you've come over better than you did when you won the show I do humility and humanity and magic all blended into one thank you so much standing there and then and then it appeared that's crazy that was cool [Music]"

chance so yeah let's see if you do it no way you can do this you can't do this she can't do it I think I got it let's see dang it are you serious why did you have to be able to do that I did his trick so now he has to copy this oh gosh what are you doing what are you kidding me I don't have to do the ending part of the main part no just a front walkover are you serious all right you know what I'll try this and if I can do it there's no way you'll do the trick that you have to copy after that I don't know if I can do this but I'll try it here we go and yes my leg physically cannot go that high into the air I literally can't do a needle okay you know what we know who won that round longest backhand s for wins wait how is this fair you're like way taller than me see this is when me being taller comes to my advantage and by me being taller I mean than her not most people okay you know what I think you should go first actually they will start at this cone and we'll put this kind all right let's see how long your back handspring is I'll try to go as long as I can and she even makes it to the next line I'll be impressed just saying five six seven eight one two oh that was so short I'm just kidding go again five six seven eight one two three four hop right there is where your feet landed I feel like that's pretty long for like my height we'll see I'll go all right she's going down I'm gonna make it and put my hands on that line and my feet on the next line oh whoa who are you crazy that literally was twice as far as hers I don't even need to say who won that round I think

actually a little nervous for this one I'm watching okay I'm watching closely jump oh my goodness I got lucky so close never underestimate the guy that overestimates himself she's going down this will be a piece of cake fly like a cheerleader sting like a boxer below level it's like a little taller than you it's basically my height as well all right come on Anna McNulty and then they jump into the wall ah that was not it you literally knocked the wall over you were gonna do a lot of things you didn't do like win this challenge I set it back up for me please you also thought you were gonna win

      "corpus": "[Music] this is some of my early animation and when I made it this was the best I could do at the time but it would be fair to say now that this is probably some of my worst animation so I dug up all these old animations that I did I'll react to them and then I'm gonna Crown one of them as the worst and of course some of my very earliest animations were flip books so first I went to my parents house and grabbed a few of my old flip books here's how that went [Music] and a quick pit stop to fuel up and there's my parents house hi Mom hi Dad [Music] here's something okay so these are some of the flip books that I made when I was a kid and there's a few specific ones in here that I'm going to grab and bring back with me and we'll leave the rest here [Music] oh I heard that noise again okay I've got some flip books from my parents house I grabbed a few newer ones as well now I don't want to do this just to like go through my old stuff and just make fun of it um because I genuinely love these flip books and I remember the feeling that I had when I made these flip books just kind of that feeling of like excitement and magic of seeing this thing come to life and move around the page first these are not ones from when I was a kid I did a video a while back called ugly flip books really though like I wouldn't I wouldn't call these my worst animation because there's a difference between ugly and bad and these are ugly on purpose so I I don't know I love the other glue flip books I'm gonna do a video another video soon where I do more ugly flipbooks this one this is one of the earliest flip books I remember making I know I've shown this before on my channel and it's very hard to flip because it was just like cut out paper on flippability scale one to ten this is like a oh maybe a two so the idea was I was making this guy flip over in the air and then land as far as animation goes that one is definitely a front runner for worst animation but again I I love it because this was the style of person that I always Drew basketball jumps through and you know I think it'd be easy for someone to look at this and just kind of not give it much credit because a kid made it and it's not quote unquote professional but I just can't help but loving it anyway because it was fun and that's kind of what it's all about I think but if I'm really having to scrutinize and award one of these flip books the title of worst um this is not going to be easy [Music] this is not one from when I was a kid I did this on for a tick tock and I just wanted to intentionally make an animation that was like really stupid looking and so this is that one so I guess you could call that my worst animation but it was intentional so then really it did what it was supposed to do all right if I'm looking at all these that's not all the flip books from when I was a kid of course just a little handful um worst animation I would almost go with this one but because it was intentional to look like that I think everyone kind of gets disqualified I'm gonna have to go with this one as much as I genuinely love it the flipbook is very hard to flip and the animation well speaks for itself so that one I proudly award the title best worst flipbook all right let's switch gears I pulled up a bunch of old stop motion I was basically learning to animate on the job like I had I had done a bit of stop-motion as a kid not a lot started working at this little Animation Studio they gave me the chance to just learn to animate see if perhaps my computer will open this file you'll notice um we were using the I was using the app animator DV professional 9.0 demo we were too cheap to spend the fifty dollars to buy the full version so I have all my early animation tests are like have these lines and this watermark on it uh yeah I didn't want to spend the 50 bucks so this was my first test with an Armature so it I mean it looks like someone's first animation with an Armature it's rough but it's like I don't know that's just kind of what you do you just start moving it and like figuring it out this is Bob [Music] made him look like he was kind of whimpering and getting sad third one I think I was imagining like a I don't know a big animal or a bear or something like coming up to him you know comes up to his side and he looks up [Music] it's weird looking at it at it now how not smooth it it was and that like then when I was doing the test and taking the frames it was like I thought it was fine this one's called sneeze [Music] [Music] that face is pretty good right there yeah so I like that one it's it's um it's funny I don't know if here I was like I will try to walk the puppet and then got like one step in and was like nope let's just do something else every shot you do you're learning something and you're practicing and you start to kind of build a like a muscle memory and so I don't know I guess for like up and coming or aspiring animators as you start to animate it's fine if it looks bad for a while you just will get better the more you do it oh there's more Bob I think [Music] kind of like this one and again still have not paid for animator DV film producer still using the demo version with the watermark on it which is kind of uh stupid this one has sound I took this little sound clip from Monty Python search for the Holy Grail now go away or I shall taunt you a second timer uh which the greatest moments in the movie we'll see here you can see that like I wasn't quite sure what what the idea like there was not really a clear idea in what I was doing with the posing like if I were to do this shot again I would go I would try to think of like what is the one idea that I'm going for in the pose and how can I show that in the most simple effective way possible let's see oh [Music] why do you think I have these outrageous Accenture silly King [Music] this was a little character called lug dance now there's a lot more stuff here than I thought this one's probably in the running for worst this is supposed to be a legitimate walk so let's see see how good this actually is okay better than better than that other one oh there you can see so um I've got fishing lines suspending him up in the air [Music] another attempt at a jump either the work day ended or I just gave up I forgot I had all this anyway it's all very rough but the more I did it the more I just got better and smoother at all of it you just you just get better the more you do it okay so here's here's an early shot that I did that like it's not smooth but but I was having a lot of fun with the performance yeah see he's like leaning way too far over he would he would be like falling over I should have just shifted that foot but I was having a lot of fun with the the performance and the and the acting and everything working on the movie animating every day by the end of that project I had some like pretty good animation under my belt and really like getting into the performances that was like such a fun part of it is just getting into the acting and I really liked that okay so we finished that project then went on to another short movie and these were some pre-production tests I did with one of the characters uh I've definitely improved by this point it's a lot better than my my first stuff with Bob that's pretty fun excited about something okay so those were test animations during pre-production and now this was actually from the opening scene of the movie I remember really I don't know just kind of like being really excited about this opening scene and then later in the movie there was this Cemetery set that I just thought was so cool you can see my walking has improved by this point [Music] [\u00a0__\u00a0] the haunted castle Katie what are we going to do so yeah I feel like from the beginning until now you can see like there was a lot of improvement it really was just it was like just animating every day and doing it and um it was just it was such a cool opportunity to work at that studio and to just get to get to to work on a couple actual projects and then through that was able to get good enough and build up a demo reel that was good enough that then was able to go on to you know working on feature films and things like that okay judging time of my early stop motion which one will I Crown the worst for the runner-up I'm gonna go with this one because I I feel like it was supposed to be a normal walk and just fell apart but I still like it because it makes me laugh and for the one I'm gonna Crown the worst I think I've got to go with this one because yeah but again I kind of don't really like picking a worse because really all of these to me represent experimenting and learning and growing uh but thanks for going on this little uh Journey with me down memory lane and I guess take away that's kind of what it is is um you know sometimes people ask me like what do you recommend for learning to animate and where do I go to school and things like that so much of it is just really just animating like every day and you just naturally just get better and better it's just like playing the piano or an instrument you just get better until eventually it just kind of becomes second nature and you're not thinking so hard about this principle or that principle it just you just kind of naturally do it all right that's it let me know if you had a a favorite or a least favorite uh what you guys think and if you have any questions please leave those down below I'd love to hear your your questions and your thoughts and um okay see you guys in the next one now go away or I shall taunt you a second timer"

      "corpus": "plushes stuffed animals whatever you call them you do not realize how much I love those things I am not kidding no matter what age or point in my life something about stupid little fuzzy squishy creatures has always filled me with so much joy you know what else fills me with joy Pokemon so combine those two things and you've got a hyper fixation like no other don't believe me look at this all mine and I am actively choosing to not stop especially the giant ones I've got two more on the way if you think I have a problem then you just don't get it now let me tell you a story back in 2022 Pokemon ended up sending me a couple little care packages not only for the release of scarlet and violet but a general Christmas one too they had a Scarlet Violet bag a poster cute little tie of course a plush of one of the starters and the Christmas one had little Pokemon ornaments as well as a very generous 100 gift card to the Pokemon Center the Pokemon company's merch store of course I ended up spending like 900 buying more plushies anyway but that's not that's besides the point by the way I had no idea they were gonna send me anything in the first place like I have no idea how they found my address it kind of just appeared anyway in the boxes there is also a business card for a contact at the Pokemon company Stefan I decided to send them an email mentioning the boxes were received safe and sound and to say thank you so much for sending me anything in the first place because it made me very happy to my surprise Stefan actually responded and was very happy it all delivered with no problems they also mentioned that if I ever needed anything Pokemon related to hit them up and I don't know why but in that moment understanding I had just purchased 900 worth of Pokemon plush's two hours prior I decided to say Stefan can you send me an entire Pokedex of Pokemon plushes for me to rank and long story short Stefan the goat made it happen a few business days later and an enormous box full of 174 Pokemon Plushies was on my doorstep fun fact that equates to 30 whole pounds of plushies so it was specifically in the Box was all of generation 5's decks of Pokemon sitting Cuties which is Pokemon's plush line dedicated to making a plush form of every single Pokemon in a certain generation the Gen 5 line is actually really special because they sent it to me before they were even released to the public like Stefan said I'm the only Creator that's been approved to have all of this new line which once again thank you so much Pokemon company you don't know how much this means to me I am eternally grateful I do want to clarify that the Pokemon company sent me all these plushies for free out of the kindness of their own Hearts but they aren't paying me to like promote them or make a video or anything this is all me however if you just happen to want to get yourself any of the plushes you see in the video the line is available starting April fifth on the Pokemon Center website if you're the US Canada or UK it sounds like a sponsor but it's not I just I just like Pokemon a lot okay is that such a crime now all that being said I'm gonna do the first ever IRL tier list of every single Gen 5 sitting cutie Pokemon has to offer I haven't seen them yet I'm going into it completely blind and Pokemon if you're watching if a plush just happens to be a little bit ugly I hope you understand that I'm gonna have to call it ugly I'm so sorry please please don't be mad at me I have to speak the truth for the people so as you can see we have a IRL tier list first ever done from my knowledge I haven't looked oh I should probably talk about what we're going to be doing as like critique so we're going to be looking at how good the Pokemon looks just in general since they're called sitting cuties we're gonna rank them based on how well they sit so if they're like look really good but they face plant that's the sit ring yeah the sit rank I think that's fair I think that's fair yeah S rank best ones they look great they sit great 8 here is they look good or they sit good but they're not like top top tier you know B is being generous because Pokemon might be watching and then we've got the sad tier which I didn't want to say was like D or F tier that's the bad one it's not the best it could be better I don't know how many are gonna be good like I said I haven't looked at them all yet we're gonna plop them down here take a good old Gander and then we're gonna put them in the tier list the Pokemon company sent me a nice little letter they said let me know which one's your favorite and I'm like I'm gonna tell you all my opinions I don't think they knew what they were signing up for we found Victini I will say right out the gate this guy looks great he sits very well he's got his little wings he doesn't sit that well actually like if I were to plop him down he'd fall over I'll consider Victini very cute if I'm a Victini fan I'd be ecstatic about this I think this is a safe a tier because he's not that consistent on the sitting but if I had him on my desk I would look at him and be like that's an awesome guy next we've got Snivy this guy is a funny guy he's very uh narrow if you can see like his head is very thin oh my God I did not expect him to sit at tostada what you look at a Snivy I there he goes the feet have to be spread for him to sit overall I think he looks great he's got his little wispies as a Snivy fan would he be happy about him I don't know if I could be a snipey fan though my instinct is to put him a little B tier he's a little thin narrow that's why I want him to him to plump to him so he'll go right here servine looks much better I will say see like he's got more plumpness to him I think he sits pretty good I'd say they got his little back toe do you see it I think he's also a good old beach here I'm seeing so many guys you don't really realize how many Pokemon are in Unova until you have 174 plushes of them all I mean at what point do you just dump them all out you're right actually be free guys oh my God does that become better or worse for you um it'll get much more simple we're moving on yep we're good at that big well here's this guy I'll put him there for Now and Then There He Is We got him we got him this guy's awesome he's got his little little Oinky tail I did not expect them to be like sitting kind of like in a meerkat stance yeah he's kind of like up and ready you know but honestly I think this is a great one I think he goes a tier as well very cute it looks like he's got underwear on though Pig night I could just like plop him down however and he sits the more I look at him he's funny looking and you're not ranking it off your personal Pokemon no no but like because you're not a pig night fan I'm not a pig night fan but I think he gets a solid B tier because Tepig is cuter and then we've got embor big man all things considered sits well that looks like embor I think he gets beat here good old beat here so maybe I need to start changing my opinions a little bit maybe a little meaner oh quick Oshawott oh that's adorable oh oh he has a round bottom and he's got like a Mickey Mouse nose I think he looks great I like how the seashell is like plush as well it's not just like felt it on I think he's a great guy he doesn't sit that well though actually he's got like beans at the bottom do you hear it I think the engineers Oshawott Engineers put beans in his butt so that he sits easier so he's built to last he's built to sit and you know what I think that's an a for effort I think he's so damn cute that I can look past how difficult it is for him to sit naturally I think he goes in a tier I think that's a really cute guy we got a duat here who looks like he's standing standing guy in the sitting cuties line he actually can sit down actually he sits really well that's probably the best hit we've seen so far I think he looks great I think he also goes into a tier so can you find Samurott in here yes I can Jacob we got him oh he looks a little silly silly guy very good Sid that is a posture we're like I could plop him down and he sits automatically the big old sausage head of him looks a little funny I don't know how they were supposed to translate it they've got his attitude do you see like the smolder smart look he's pissed I get that he's a Samurai and he's supposed to be like ready to fight or something this is a solid B tier carried by the sit I think carried by the sit if he didn't sit and he looked like that it's a sad face here oh got him oh my goodness he sits but he's a little crooked I might say I would have liked it to be like more planted like this I guess you have to mold him just compared to these guys I think it's a bit of a downgrade I think he's a sad face too I think he understands I feel bad he looks so alone and sad tostada will you find Pat rat for me she doesn't know what to do she doesn't even know what a pet rat is oh got him got him whoa this is a I've got some notes with him oh no pet red too chunky for his own good this is what he's supposed to look like I will say I think this is the first one where the color is a little off compared to normal Pat rat and his face is giant he sits well after kind of like molding him to the ground a little bit I think he goes right here no what do you think he goes higher no I just it's just it's sad right it's a bummer every time I feel like I'm just being really mean to these innocent Pokemon now we got watchog oh I see him oh I like his little toes he's got the little like Adventure Time hands I think that's adorable the face is not better can you get a side profile on him he's got like a little bit of like a indented face oh my God it's actually like he is meant to have an indented face he's got like the pattern just printed on to him I just don't think he looks that great no I'm gonna put him with his buddy I think that makes it a little easier for them because at least they have each other okay now we got lillipop oh no buddy you're gonna make me have to rethink the entire tear the body looks good so sad you want to see tostada what do you no you don't go to that tear tostada your s tier I think this is not great it's cute but I feel like this is more of a prototype than anything I think he's not quite fully baked okay her deer is next yeah I found them this is actually a really good one proportions are good he fits really great if I'm a Herdier fan I pop off with this plush I think he's eightier there you go buddy yeah he looks great yeah he he fits amongst the other ones I'm actually kind of rethinking Victini I'll give it like a couple more but he he's very close to being asked here at this moment oh yeah stoutland there he is oh my God surprisingly small I think it was an interesting choice to sew his little Tufts down because he's kind of just a form I think he's a safe b-tier because I don't think he's as bad as lillipop but he's not as great as hertier we've got Purrloin coming up that we found life part oh look oh this just looks like oh no uh we're running into the lillipop conundrum let me just like mold him he looks great I love how they have the little arms curve out like they do in the actual Pokemon game he does like one of these like that and that's what they did here it kind of makes it look a little weird with the little gloves but I would say pretty good the face doesn't look the best it kind of looks like someone's fursona but I think that's also kind of the territory that purloin is in the solid beat here I would say then we've got light part light part looks great sits really well he's got his little tuft here I like how they always are pretty good about the little tufties he kind of looks like he's taking a little pee do you see that yeah there's an elevated leg there yeah something's happening I think it looks good I think it's also just a beach here though there you go pan Sage here we go found him immediately I'll say it I'm a Pansage hater and proud and vocal he looks fantastic he oh he sits pretty well he looks soft and cute not a thought behind those eyes the sage heads are popping off for this one I think this is the first pan Sage dub in like forever I think this is what's gonna happen I think this guy and this guy get promoted to S tier breaking the seal I think they just look really really good like I see that and I'm like oh that's adorable that's a Pokemon plush every little part of them are like adorable and I can't believe that Victini is up there with pants age so semi-stage is NYX this is age he sits really well for as complicated as he is I think he looks fantastic feels easily thrown off balance by like just a little bit of like an earthquake oh no well that's like a seven earthquake a Seven's a lot a seven would knock this whole bookshelf down if I'm a semi-stage fan I think this is a fantastic plush I think he replaces where Victini was with a tier okay now we've got pan sear the the fire guy there he is I found him oh we haven't encountered any of them that don't actually sit yet which I'm surprised this guy looks great I think he's cute I don't know what it is maybe it's just the face I don't think he looks as good as pants age I think it's also the big flame like the the bush up there looks really really good but this is like a little bulbous you know but I think that's a solid a tier still yeah he belongs there okay send me Seer I found him this guy's tail he looks funny he's a little too goofy oh the the mouth is a little different is that how he is that's super cute I didn't notice that he looks fine he's also just an eighth here I would say he doesn't sit that great though it has an age here yeah do you belong up there no he doesn't there we go he belongs there send me see a poor Panpour this is my least favorite one but but nothing I think it's still not good I just do not like this Pokemon I don't like what he's about I don't like the energy he brings into the room the more I look at him the more I think he's beat here no yeah I think that's fair I think pan Sage is the cutest and pan sear is also cute this one is not cute b-tier who's next Semi poor aha this one actually looks much better than it looks super hard to balance though is this guy gonna sit oh we got it you really gotta mush him let's see here I think it looks fine it's just so hard because I don't like this Pokemon at all um but it's a good plush I don't know how but I think it looks better than this one I guess I just like well no my bias don't let it go any higher but you know the truth um the next is Mana here he is oh my my goodness this guy's adorable that's a good place this is a fantastic mono plush there's not even anything to critique it sits well it's got like good proportion this being a monopush is fantastic I think this is a great plush yeah this is a very underwhelming Pokemon but he goes straight up to S tier all right and then this guy does he sit like this I guess he sits like that I think this one also looks good it's not an easy of an S tier as the other one I think this is a good Pokemon I'd say that's an easiest or a tier perfect a little Taylor a Pito I saw Pita this is like over here somewhere oh there he is whoa I'm not gonna move him at all but that bait goes crazy that is an upward facing beak so you guys know I'm I'm a bird lover this guy does not impress me where'd you say you had high standards as a bird fan I don't even think so I think he just could look better but I don't even know how to make him better I mean compare it to this compare him to this guy that you can't buy yet but eventually you can I really think it's the beak that messes it up maybe I just got a faulty one but it just goes up like that and it's not supposed to I don't think he's too great I think he goes down here he sits fine it's just the beak that really messes with me um okay now we go to tranquil this guy looks much better see like he sits better I don't know if it's like a different fabric it doesn't feel like it but he's much softer as well this bake is arguably more weird shaped than this one and they did a phenomenal job with it I think this is an easy eighth here I think it's a good Pokemon plush we can do both oon pheasants at the same time oh I found him he was at my feet she this is the he oh he Jacob doesn't know bird facts I would say they both go into the same tier I think it's a head shape like this one's head shape was so good this guy just doesn't look that great he's a little turkey-like I could even put this in the Forbidden realm in the Forbidden realm oh his beak also goes up oh no yeah it's also like the back of this fabric is not soft it's like the back of the fabric is also different maybe he does go to the Forbidden realm sorry buddy I guess they aren't in the same tier but we're on to Blitzle now oh here he is oh he he is meant to sit this guy's cute oh that's a good one he's a really good one unfortunately I think the different fabric is like he's not as soft as the other ones and I think that's because this fabric is easier to print on because like they printed on the stripes I wish she was softer but honestly he's really good I'd say he's eightier he could have been s here if he was like the really soft fabric yeah he's close though he's a really I think High a tier I wouldn't feel bad putting him in ashes because we have so few you think so he can he can chill up there for now you're so right oh he also looks good like I think it's hard well wait hold on let me look at him his head is Giant and then his body is Tiny like look at the head compared to the body giant head the tail actually looks really really good for being as complicated of a shape as it is he looks great though I think it's it's solid baked here it's going to be hard to put any of like the the big strong Pokemon an S tier because I think what makes a good plush is it being cute it's just hard to make good looking plushes be scary and tough we're looking for frog and roll off there he is whoa bro is 3D he sits phenomenally well oh that was designed to sit this is my my pitch to the Pokemon company you need to make rock and roll a pencil sharpeners I think that merch goes crazy I think this guy goes into beats here though but if he could sharpen pencils though if he was a pencil sharpener s tier I think they did as best as they could with him but he just doesn't look too too great I think it just he's meant to be a b-tier guy then we got boldor which is not him right there they're together he actually looks great I love the color I've actually never looked at Baldor before oh wait they made it so like he's just sitting completely easy eight here is he aest here I'm thinking if I'm a bulldore fan and I had this plush I'm like it's Boldore it's a perfect Bowl door would you say that's a nest here I think he's a contender for sure but he's definitely not as cute no he is I think he's an S tier I think he goes down here yeah this is a smart decision then we got gigolith given what he is I don't think he looks bad at all I think he just runs into the thing with zip strika or whatever it just doesn't look tough no he's not supposed to be a plush form he's supposed to be a cool action figure where you can get all his tough edges and and corners and stuff he doesn't look bad I also like how he can just do like a little dance oh his face is very narrow though I think it looks good but uh looks a lot better from the side if I can be honest like I'm seeing it from the side seeing from the front doesn't bode the same his design has a plush ceiling you know oh no I really want to put him in B but the more I look I think he's not that great it's the face that really does it for me it's this face buddy like just trying to put him here yeah no yeah that's okay I'm sad about it Pokemon you did good it was hard to work with uh who bet I know where he is this is just a woo bet straight up woo bet I like how they made him really fuzzy bro sits down no matter what he's like really throwable in the hand like a Chuck and he flies s here easy woo bad EST here oh I see him oh my gosh look at him he's so excited oh that's a good one he's awesome he's a silly little guy they gave him like a lot of character somehow like his wings are up his tail looks good a weird shape or a tail but it looks fine his face is silly and happy his feet are cute he has like the anime Gap in his smile yeah what a guy is he also asked here wow it's the ones you don't expect I guess drover oh I saw this guy before where is he he's one of my favorites look at this this guy he's asked here in my heart personally yeah say what you will he's awesome if Drilbur was my ride or die and I've got him as a plush I would pop off this is the nature of Drilbur whether you like it or not he's asked here hey it's your tier list I am not wrong no I never deserves s tear who are we looking for X control yeah I see him I see him this little guy also looks great though I feel like they still captured his like tough and rugged aspects while also still being cute I think the design choice to have his pupils be square but the rest of his body be very cute and plush-like was really really good I like how they embroidered his design and isn't just like painted on they choose to like print some textures and like embroider some but it looks really good in this case I think he looks great but I'm just starting to mix up S tier and a tier I'm a huge Excadrill fan but is this an S tier plush do I put these both in the same tier my heart wants to I say follow your heart I think they both go up here like I need to go over here on this side now I love that drover so much he's such an awesome guy oh Dino's next found him immediately this guy's adorable holy crap that's just straight up Audino I like his little feet his little hands this plush looks good I think it's eight here no more thoughts just yeah just eight here Timber where's the little man oh here he is they're all together whoa this guy's great he's really cute I would say the Vlog I didn't expect them to make it Square because I feel like it's so much easier to make a cylinder plush but I like the attention to the Square log I think he looks funny and silly and cute I think he's a good one I think he goes eight here yeah that looks like him this is girder right yeah it is girder this guy is a weird Pokemon well he even sit is this the first one that won't sit no he can't sit but not well yeah you gotta finagle him he's a finagler I just don't like the look of this Pokemon if I can be honest his little steel being team I don't know how they could have made the steel beam I think I think this is the best it could be it's okay his face is okay they put actual metal in it he would fall over every day of the week kids would be throwing their girder plushes at each other in like recess and he would be banned from schools he's really hard to sit I was surprised I got him to sit in the first place I just don't like him yeah and besides here and he's not sitting for it either there we go he's kind of got a hunch over and his comfort her I'll be honest this guy looks really good I feel like his beam stabilize him unlike the others yeah like his beams definitely help him out in the sitting category he looks fine I think this plush form does his original form Justice to be honest and I don't think we've encountered that before so I think I'll put him in a tier because of that no beat here you snuck in buddy almost I just saw this guy and I was like no I think it's hard for not cute Pokemon to break into a tier and higher I don't think it's impossible Blitzle did it it takes a lot it takes a lot Temple where is he there he is this guy's adorable oh that's a plush that's just a straight up Temple there's not even anything to really critique it's just that's just straight up pimple and his airpod eyebrows yeah that's him a tier simple palpitode there he is it's interesting that they did like the little seam here to make his little bulbous mouth I don't think it really works the way they wanted it to I think it just makes him look a little strange he's a very small guy expected him to be bigger I'd say B tier he's not bad there you go I see exactly the guy we're supposed to do next honestly I forgot there was another one size me toad a very wide what a funny guy he's very wide in the face he looks pretty good being a final Evo I think he's an eighthier final Evo honestly no he's mad close he was very close uh then we got throw and sock I know throw is over here no that suck we'll do them together there you are sock looks great throw is very Square I think it's how he's built that is how he's built but why does he look different sock looks very unmodel throw just looks like like a Minecraft villager or like oh like the Easter Island statue yeah the Eastern Islands heads I think he looks funny sock looks great throw is a tear below him oh you gotta split him up I do have to split them up I think sock can go here oh no they sit really well though I just like the um pheasant peeking up oh yeah I forgot we banished him next is sea waddle so waddle is cute big head barely doesn't sit yeah I don't know what constitutes is a sit but he is Towing the line very big headed man very cute though it's not a lillipop situation but I think they could have shrunk his head a little bit oh there's like the little leaf hole I like that detail I think this will go Beach here this guy oh my goodness swad loon Swadloon looks fantastic he looks ready to sit he was born to sit I think I think he's adorable I like this Pokemon a lot it's wild loon for what it's worth I think he looks great I think this is just a tier straight up a tier and then we got levani I think the legs look really good for a complicated design very thin I think he looks fine I like it I think this is the definition of b tier yeah this is B tier you can go with little baby Venipede there he is oh my gosh he's just perfect do you see him that's an instant s here I already know perfect guy I think it's everything you'd want in a plush you know exactly like he's firm but not hard you know he's squishy perfect proportions I would say he's just straight up Skyrocket to S tier Venipede good on you buddy benefit and then it's Whirlipede this is dense this is like the densest Pokemon plush we've got can he spin oh kinda it's like a weird Pokemon to have as a plush to be honest they did fine I think it's a good a tier for Whirlipede you can go like like this and then Scolipede whoa Scolipede is like one of my favorite bug Pokemon and I'll be honest this isn't Scolipede I think it was too hard to make a plush of him honestly he's a little wonky he's a bit of a little shrimp man I love this Pokemon but unfortunately I think he goes down here it's so sad poor thing then we got cottony so this is a cotton he's very tall that's a big cottony he's a very big guy not supposed to be that big no he's very tall too he's kind of supposed to be like more like this but he's very she's rounder usually more ovular I don't think he's bad but it's not quite I guess he's Burger Vibes where I see it or like little macaroon better than a burger I think it's a good plush but I think he goes into B tier because it's not quite the proportions make me feel like it's not quite there but he's very cute and then we go Whimsical here do you want no right no no I got it I just want to zoom in on Whimsical I love whimsicot for the record this is one of my favorite guys this is an easy s tier for me but I'll let you talk about it I think this is a fantastic place it's just the perfect shape they have his proportions correct fantastic he's got good like plushness he's very cute I think this is a one to one whimsicott plush to the original so I I think he's he definitely goes up in s tier as well I just think he's straight up cute he's adorable pet oil surprisingly sits well this is a very bright yellow almost like a lime I think this is a very very good petal ale I think it's adorable the shape is perfect but the color is not quite there I think they could have used this color and it would have been a perfect petal it's a shame because this is s tier quality but the color brings them down to a tier for me and Lil again very bulbous very very cute I would say um I think it's it's great the flower is huge for as complicated as a plush Design This is they did a fantastic job I don't think it could be S tier but it's straight up with a tier just like pedalil now we got the basculins we'll judge them together one they have different eyes yeah what is my opinion on these guys this one looks better but I think it's just because the eyes are wider this one's kind of like got the the Mean Mug and look I don't know how but his lip is like fatter even though I don't think that's true this guy goes here oh tough buddy this guy can go here BT is getting filled out uh Sandile oh my goodness look at him oh this is a good one big head but he makes it work he makes it work his legs are like out like that so that like helps balance out he's a good guy I think the head is a little bit big like a little too puffy for Sandile but he's a very cute guy I think it's straight up to a tier for him he can go here that a little is staring at him I think this guy looks great that's just he's just got Ari Vibes the proportions are good the shapes are good right up to eightier again you go there and we got crocodile he's over here oh here oh why is his mouth down like that come on buddy his mouth droops down a lot which is a bummer I think this guy is awesome they did his hands really well I like his little trunk feet I think if they made this now a little bit shorter like this it would be easier for it to not droop down I think he's great though good shape to him I'll put him in a tier two just because I like the line a lot Darumaka I think this guy's adorable what a funny silly guy I think he could be rounder though yeah it's such a Pokemon made to be a plush if I was like a little child I could easily have this be my my favorite plush that I take everywhere and hide in my backpack and bring him to school I do think this is an a-tier plush though oh wow this is the wrong color question mark that looks kind of brown it's a very Brown the Zen mode looks good the Zen mode looks really good yeah I love the tiny tiny detailed plush Parts because they look good and they look hard to get right this is just like straight up plastic that's been printed on darmana tan the shapes look good but it's just not the right color it feels like the easy part maybe they wanted them to be like different looking side by side but the color just brings it down to be tier for me this form though looks good I think he gets uh a tier I don't know who would want a plush form of the Zen mode darmanitan but it's out there and it's a good one so miracus whoa I don't think I think this is oh I think this is gonna be the first sitting cutie that doesn't sit yeah legally honest oh wow it straight up sits the shapes that just aren't quite right though like it's supposed to be a little squished I think the colors are also a little off I love miracus I think they should have went with a lighter green like on this part his face could be cuter it was close but I don't think it's quite right so I think it's going to go down to this one oh that's tragic unfortunate I'm a huge miraculous fan as a miraculous fan I need to be honest with what I think more actus looks like we got Dwebble oh I saw him oh my goodness oh this is the most hermit crab Dwebble has ever looked I mean I feel like it's no surprise that all the little cute Pokemon look little and cute in these plushies yeah this guy looks great he looks very apart though like I wish he was a little squished together like this he kind of accordions out I think he's adorable awesome dwell moment that is a b tier Crystal's pretty easy to find in here I feel oh yeah it's just a big Minecraft rock you'll leave his arms it's a pretty good one dare I say a great one why does he look like softer and cuter and fuzzier than cressel like his eyes are so cute and fluffy I didn't expect a really good Crustle plush to exist but he's right here and he's pulling it off I like him he's an a-tier you go here his little feet can dangle she's cool he's hanging out he's a great bookshelf plush and then we got Scraggy you can really see the folds oh yeah that dude's got pouches bro's got skin I I get that he's supposed to have like the extra loose skin as his little pants but I think it doesn't work here I don't think it's working for me right now it's a little too much his face I wish it was rounder and cuter I don't like him I'm sorry it's crafty though see this is this is the correct amount of like saggy skin that I would like to see like this is too much folds this is just right but it's not like two in your face and creepy he's got his little Hood too that just like hangs out I think he's fine I think that's a solid beat here and you go sigilith there you are look at this thing how does this thing sit I mean we have to put the tail flap behind him maybe I think he goes forward oh I think this is the one that doesn't yeah it's a non-sitter he kind of chills back the proportions on this man are crazy they made him very cute I think this is a great signal if plush but his head is massive compared to what he actually looks like and all things considered I think they did a good job with them I think it's an a-tier you can go up here even though you don't really sit a Yan mask oh here actually he looks great this one definitely does not sit and they did not even try to make him sit so he's got to sit like that yeah there's no attempt to sit there no he's supposed to kind of just prop him up against like a book or something all things considered he's very cute though the proportions are good the mask is fine I think it's a straight up to eighthier with him I honestly think Crystal could like qualify for S tier you think so I'm not even a crestle fan but I see him hanging out all cool like I would move Sandile and Crustle like that's just me but I'm a fan of those guys I can put them up there just because BT is getting crowded Sandile his head's kind of big his head's a bit big the crestle though because he's so cool there we go that's a cool guy um we got coffee griegas down does this guy stand who no he doesn't even stand maybe plump him up just move him around a bit you think he can but I don't think he can actually the proportions are not like how he normally is but I kind of like what they changed about him he's just like wider and shorter no matter what we do I don't think this guy is gonna sit if I'm a coffee grease fan I think he's great I'd say this is a a good old eight here even if he can't sit I think he's a good one he can stand with friends and I think that's a little friendship point that he deserves tartuga this is actually really cute his face is a little flat he doesn't have his little beak it looks like a little shelter head thing his body looks great but his face does not also his back legs could use a little fluff all around like at first glance I think he was a great little guy I do appreciate the little textures here like it's not the sewn on it's like actual textured fabric but I don't think I'm enthusiastic about Tortuga I think this is a sad face unfortunately I liked her too I just think he could have been workshopped a little bit better I think but over here caracosta oh no kind of flat but is sitting he does sit this guy was not really in a sitting position his face is not what I expected it to be either it's kind of just like they made a little ball and then put the features on I kind of want more of like the snapping turtle beak that he has I like his little sitting form though I like what he's all about but I'm not too impressed with this guy either I think he's cute but I think the best part about him is that he's sitting I think he's just gonna go right here next to his his little baby unfortunately our chin okay Archen and archeops are one of my favorite fossils or just Pokemon in general there he is oh my gosh his little bug eyes look at this oh baby baby arching oh let me get a good old look at you just a little goofy it's like an easy s tier right there you think so he's sitting he's a cutie that's a sitting cutie he's very Derpy but in the fact that Drilbur is Derpy so yeah I think he's great I'm popping off as an Archen fan he goes up here with the greats I love him and then we got archeops Big Man on Campus oh that is a big man why is he so big he's so stands up he's like his claws are just printed felt and cut felt I don't know if I agree with that one it just doesn't match his feet lots of different textures going on on this guy he's definitely not as high up as Archen I do like this man though I think they did the best they could with them my bias places him in the B tier oh we're getting a little full over there I'm looking for troubish now but here he is oh oh oh oh oh oh oh he's cute look at his little teeth popping out he's got an over white for days I don't care what people think I'm a huge trumpish fan that being said this is not the proportions of rubbish he's very wide I like him though I think his eyes are the ones that are a little off model for me but I like when he's the size of your hand thing and he sits he sits very well I think I'm also just gonna put him back and beat here though the Garba door there he is oh this is great this is super on model I think look at him he's so cute he sits his feet are way up he's super plump very plump very proportional yeah I think this is fantastic actually I don't think like the garbage door plush is cuter than the rubbish plush and I think that's incredible I don't know how they pulled that one off his little arm stays up I think this is great is this s here or is it a tier tostada what do you think do you like a garbadour no I think she said a tier yeah that's what it looked like to me that was an eight here from tostada zarua I don't think that Pokemon company would ever want to mess up a Zorua plush in their life these things gotta sell like hot cakes this is really really nice I would say good just shapes proportions he sits he's cute he's adorable I think this is nothing short but just a nastier plush I think it's straight up here for him [Music] oh hello sorry I'm looking at tostada he likes Zoroark tostada acting like she doesn't see uh we got zorark now he looks good like we said already the tiny little baby plushes are so easy to make I look like if you have like human like appendages it's just hard to put that into a plush too yeah like he's got so much going on so much time his tiny little waist but I think they make it work really well now nothing looks weird I mean his little tufties are pretty soft but I think that's just comes with the territory of having it be a plush this is great what makes this an S tier tostada I'm gonna have to lock her out I think he's great I'll be nice I'm we're gonna put them both in s tier why not I think it's good Encino oh yeah this one has to be little right he's tiny tiny I feel like his head is Too Tall it should be rounder and more like a swish to be a little more cute everything is set up to be great but I don't think they got the head size correct and he's a little he could be so much more chibi cute he sits really well though I like the colors if he was just like a little more like this you know it's so cute but when I saw it I went that's not quite right no it feels too mean I can't be mean to Mancino he goes here since you know on the other hand this is right they got the head like good this time it's nice and round and full he's cute he's chibi this is a really good plush he's like all the little hair parts are nice and full and Squishy he's soft he sits after a little bit of messing around he's a good one I don't know any die hard since you know fans but if you are one then this is a good plush I'd say I'd say up here just because it's so full you know some plushes are a little flat he's great all around what are you doing playing with batteries he took our battery away oh and she's even playing with tostada literally Gothita okay my bias is gonna come out with this line I think if they were gonna do goth Gardevoir they could have made it so much better than this line but alas here we are I think the lips are really cute and funny though the whole head is really big and the face is Tiny it's not quite right even as a Gothita naan enjoyer it's not quite right the body is cute it sits surprisingly well but this thing goes here I don't like looking at it and that's because I don't like the Pokemon is it just me or is this whole line not look quite right it could be better it's not bad I think like the head should have just been smaller here and they fixed that problem with Gothita I think it's a good plush it's soft I like the colors we'll put you up here to a b tier how about that I feel like that's generous got the tail with the little ladies spreading her tiny tiny legs to sit down it just feels like the more involved a design is the worse it is as a plush I feel like they absolutely tried their best but it does not translate to a plush like this line is more for figurines I think tostada oh are you trapped come out here will you come look at her oh my God she got stuck I was thought of you pitiful thing no she got soft locked yay figured it out all right no more bathroom for her so with uh this whole pool of plushes remaining are we gonna talk about the other two boxes you have over there we'll talk about it later we'll get to it we'll get to it but yeah the dress like they were trying to get the layers of the dress but it's just cut fabric and it doesn't feel that great um so I think this one goes down here with the baby that's just how it goes sometimes Solosis okay big celosis fan over here oh oh no so it says oh my God he's perfect I mean that's just a stress ball I think he's perfect there's just nothing he that is wrong with him look he's got a little backside looks like butt cheeks up here perfect perfect specimen little being devotion also fantastic perfect being specimen two nothing is wrong with him he sits is there beans a little bit of beans perfect also as tear up here it's kind of like the same plush but a different shape reunicliss I don't know why he's just an awesome guy I don't think he sits though a little earlier than just a ball it's not so much that he sentence that he balances yeah I think he does a good job I don't think he's meant to sit he's really supposed to like float it just looks really good to me as a completely biased person um he goes straight up here too the whole family the whole wine he does take up a lot of space with his Open Arms oh make him hug the others like a little this oh oh oh oh my gosh family oh my God I'm so happy for them chocolate found you you know he's just like a little girl that's a duck if I've ever seen one there's a duck that is duck lit I think he's fine he looks great no other sitting cuties have had this fabric yet so I think that's really cool it's like feathery hey tear I think his face is really cute too swanna this one will be interesting so one is much more detailed oh oh they just pinned our wings down that makes sense the head is a lot swano looks good the head and tuffies are really big I feel like ducklet is much cuter than the swanna plush but that's just how it is I think it looks good the fabric is just a little off-white so my gut reaction is to think it's a little dirty but I don't think that's true I think it's just like slightly off gray but I think it looks fine I'd say this is a b tier B tier 4 swanna vanilla the infamous ice cream cone this guy looks great I'd say that's a one to one not a sitter he's more of a he gets held you're supposed to like hold him like this forever the ice cream cones are not meant to sit and if they made him sit it would be an Abomination he'd be like this and I don't think anyone wants that I think this is great this is just a good plush I think it goes up to S tier because you sew on model yeah it's just good vanillish whereas he tostada she's got a lot to say tonight she's got Zoomies right now she she gets the late nights and the talkies the Takis and the Zoomies hello there wait oh wait oh you reviewed the wrong one I reviewed the wrong one okay we'll we'll go baby now my bad vanillite okay so the other one was vanillish this is vanillite pardon me I don't know the line that well the vanillish fans are in flames right I'm gonna he looks great I got a tiny little baby guy all right now we've got vanilla are you sure yes I'm pretty sure the vanillux community I'm sorry guys I have to put a statement out now um he looks fine the straw is a little wonky I wish it was up more but I feel like that's something out of their control especially when shipping them in like a container that squeezes them like this I think it's fine I think it's also uh an eightier here okay the deerlings yeah I was about to ask can we just knock all these out yeah we're doing all the deerlings at one time we've I already of course we have one for each okay they look great I wonder how each of these sell comparatively I respect their dedication to having a plush of every single possible Pokemon out there I respect it I'm just shocked yeah they look good I think they could look a little better but I don't know how I would change it yeah if anything these were the mass-produced ones so yeah I think they all belong in beats here yeah cram them all in together make it work they're not gonna sit down they're gonna all be back here to get I sure hope salzbuck is either really good or really bad yeah we need a few less B tiers in the world they're just up there all right stars back which we also have four of we do have four of them hey tostada she's just still watching these ones have all completely different skins as well like they're not even just copy paste yeah because they have a lot of different antlers yeah these also look fine again huge props to them for making individual new [Music] it's the same but they put different antlers different Tufts actually this one has different little things too they look great win for the salzbach community I got this beat here but do what feels right what's right is Beats here do what crams right I can't put them make it work just shove them all in there they take up so much space too yeah well you should have had bigger tears you go here all right or perfectly not cramped here I wish that Ikea made bigger bookshelves Emolga I love imoga he's my favorite Pikachu my favorite little Pikachu where are you oh here he is so cute that's a little guy very very small tiny man mocha is naturally small but that guy is little children hold them like this like if I was a little kid with my amolga plush I'd run around with like this he's very cute the proportions are a little not quite right for my taste I wish the ears went a little more like this way I think he's great I would say this is right up to a tier yeah that's the littlest form of a moga I've ever seen I recommend that emulga to Eddie amolga fans Kara blast he kind of just oh here he is oh my God a little football why is he so chunky like this he's like a little smooshed Hershey's Kiss he kind of sits backwards a little bit let me let me oh that looks good so it looks a bit more curved than he should he's very bottom he's a curvy little guy he's angry and he's curvy I think this guy is awesome um thoughts feelings they made him such a droplet um I think that even though he's more droplet form I think that was the executive correct decision I now have an opinion on Kara blast and he's an awesome little guy he will go back here as Cavalier here you are oh his arms he is swinging please he'll jab you this guy does not look that great it's a very confusing using design and I think the plush makers were just like I'll be honest I got nothing so he's gonna go down here but he's in a he's a very funny but it's an understandable sad tear it's a sad tier that's slash pause a slash Paws the frown face fungus he is tall I wish he was more droplet formed he's supposed to be more like this am I wrong but he's like this definitely does not sit he is a top heavy man yeah this guy does not sit oh hello tostada fungus no you're not in the frowny-face tear tostada I would say this guy is not that great if he just was like like this size then I'd be like this is perfect I want one what everyone was looking for everyone wants to know this one what's this guy's name comment section who is he he doesn't look great he's a funny guy he's a funny guy what can I say he's a little silly frillish oh we'll do both of them at the same time as well they don't sit do they they just fall maybe they we can do like one of these cute like this oh no that works totally that totally works but yeah they do sit nothing spectacular about them nothing bad I'd say be tear uh jealousint these guys definitely sit like the other ones why is this one so far it really is flop and I did not expect this one to be so flat compared to this one I've never been a big gelison fan but these are cute this one's just like sits on the floor though it's hard to have opinions on these guys because they're so oddly shaped but if you had to have an opinion but if I had oh they even had little tentacles actually this one actually looks a little weird like the head is really big compared to this one I feel like this one's more on model than this one I think they get separated yeah I think I gotta separate them as ironic as that is I feel like that's like the first big separation you go here God that is a cramp shelf that b tier and then these guys right in there yeah people don't realize all the Pokemon that are behind this tier alabamola okay I forgot this was a Gen 5 pokemon I always thought there's a Lola alola for some reason oh really I think it's because it's in the name that makes sense very flat but a very flat Pokemon it's Ala Moana could be better don't know how that's a b tier I know exactly how to put this one in biting it in yeah that's perfect that's perfect oh look at tostada where is she oh oh you're looking like that okay she's done looking like that joltec okay I've got a story for joltick here so I'm a huge joltec fan if Pokemon were real I would have a little joltic just like this every once in a while I go through a plush buying phase like every month and I go on to eBay and I just like look at what eBay has to offer in terms of the plushes they have and I saw this plush I this was like a month ago before the line was released or I even knew it existed and I saw this plush on eBay for like way more money than he should have been I'm not gonna disclose how much it was because you'll judge me a lot you buy it you have another one oh oh I see so I bought this one they have different tags and he's also different wait what what maybe it's just not a sitting cutie maybe well either way I've got two joltec plushes this is the sitting cutie this is just a random one that was way too much money um I like this one but we're ranking this one this one's very cute he's definitely a more compact than this one over here but he's perfect I think he's great I wish these were like out more to give his face like a little more fluffy face but I can't put joltec any lower than Esther he was meant to be a plush and he was meant to be my best friend oh there he is all right galvangelo another friend oh joltec and Galvantula are one of my favorite lines ever I love these guys his legs are all spindly he's a cute guy I like him I wish that these were plush and not like I'm not a big fan of the cut out felt but I think that's just what they have to do sometimes I think he's great I wish he was a little more plush like though he's a little like too loose for for me to call it fantastic so I think he goes safely in the eighth year just like that [Music] um phariseed little guy it's the tiny ones that they can get perfect honestly it's a spiky little stress ball he is oh it's this one uh they kind of just removed that one and no one would have noticed he can sit but it's difficult for him I I'll be honest I can look past the not sitting because this is perfect this is a perfect Pharisee yeah he's gonna get crammed so many little brothers are gonna get this thrown to their head and that is an S tier for me Pharaoh Thorn now Pharaoh Thorn I see him yeah I feel like he's gonna have like the jabbies can you spit him for us yeah he's got physics to him this is like the noodliest one we've we've encountered his face is a little goofy just the the legs are so long and funny looking they're pretty good though it's a complicated shape and I think they nailed it I think I think this is a good old beat here oh he's easy to cram in there though yeah yeah he doesn't take up much space we got clean clink clunk these guys and it's like this is a cute little plush I get what he's about okay here's what they did they made one of these guys and then they sewed them together you can see oh they are the same guy right same guy I think that's funny for a plush he's fine nothing when I asked here wow maybe not actually know how to trust your heart my heart says this yeah his name's clang okay this one is a lot more bulbous she likes clang uh this guy's fine B tier cling cling well all things wait wait wait wait we gotta compare we gotta compare get back out here is this the same guy wow I think that's the same guy the main difference is this one's a little more bulbous they didn't film as much but man they just repurposed them I mean that's just what the Pokemon is it's just the same guy but now he's got stuff on him I think they could just go together honestly I mean they are pretty much the same after all oh there you go Dynamo I love this line oh my goodness huge Tynamo fan here and I can say with a lot of bias this isn't quite right his head is very big he's very ice cream cone like this is a chubby man but he's very cute I think he's a good plush but I would say as an avid Taino enjoyer uh this is a b tier there you go electric probably the not the best Pokemon name out there it's probably my least favorite but electric is a cool guy I think he's fine he's a little flat but no points against it does not sit really nothing else to say you go right in the eighth here electross my favorite guy ever electross is so underrated come on sit for me buddy please please no how I need you to sit work with me here he doesn't sit I don't think he sits electross is one of my favorite Gen 5 pokemon unfortunately he does not sit but I think he looks great this is a good electross plush he is big tough guy and they they kept his big tough guy energy and I like that I like his big tough guy energy he's a good one he doesn't sit but I'm biased so he goes way up here he sits alongside his friends he has to lean on Crustle Elgin the Forgotten guy the tiny forgotten baby oh that is uh this is this is infant built this is the the build of a little baby how can you not look at this and say a human baby I think he's cute oh yeah I had to look up a picture he does have like the little indents here I didn't know that about him he's just such a funny little guy I don't know how to rank him I'd say beat here yet again you can go right on Seismitoad oh he's got little butt cheeks did you guys know that I didn't know that until the little plush look at his little butt cheeks does he sit he absolutely does with butt cheeks like that he's actually really cute I like his little stance like like that he sits he's got a little feet I'd say this is an a tier right there all right Ludwick very cute Pokemon the plush worm is also very cute it sits I wish he wasn't as tall like if they made him a little squished down I think it's a good push though Litwick is cute and this is a cute plush I'd say a good old eight here I love Litwick lamb pint I like this guy I think he's a silly little cute mid-evolution the top is just the printed cut felt which you know like I said I'm not the hugest fan of he's got the little top as a butt [Laughter] sorry buddy it's my bad a great little despite having this big old like whenever they do the the cut fabric like this my brain automatically thinks like a little bit cheap but I don't know how they would fix it without it looking bad so funny is fine it goes up here with his friend Chandelure a huge Chandelure fan here this line is not meant to sit the tag is also in a weird spot he kind of just sits there he kind of sits kind of he he leans back he chills he kind of like reclines that's the word I'm going for given the fact he's a chandelier they did a fantastic job with him nothing feels out of place everything looks proportional and symmetrical and consistent I think they could have made a lot worse of Chandelure plushes I think this is great he's a little too spindly to go to S tier so the whole line is a tier axio a big fan favorite Pokemon this guy is another baby meant to be a plush he is the colors feel a little off though yeah I feel like you should be more green yeah he was supposed to be a little like a decent amount darker especially on the top part here he feels very very green I think that's the biggest thing throwing me off great proportions he's a cute little guy I just wish they had more accurate colors for the plush so I think for that he'll go beat here I'll just sit right here for me perfect fracture I love fracture oh no he's a little squished his face goes in like this as a big fracture fan this wasn't quite what I was picturing it's not quite white it's not going white I think this guy goes down here the head shape is not quite right but I love the Pokemon and we've got Haxorus oh Haxorus what did they do with him oh no what do they do he's got the gamer neck banana man I do like him I kind of like that he's got scoliosis he just wants to sit here and play his little video games on his computer on his PC I think the colors on this guy is like a little bit off too yeah it's very easy he should not be a banana man he's a banana man banana shrimp man also his face is like a completely different texture I guess it's kind of like dragon scales I like that I'll be honest he's growing on me I think I'm putting him in a tier not because B tier looks like this but because I like him very much Cub chew I think oh this guy's adorable I think his ears are a bit of a strange shape but overall this guy's cute he's sturdy he sits he's got his old dingly snot I put him in a tier though I think that's a solid a tier we got bear tick this guy's big yeah that's bear tick he looks fine he's got a huge five head though his forehead is huge I think this guy's fine I think he could have been a little cuter but overall decent so with that he goes straight in here oh you're running out of room cryogenol here he is whoa this is just different all around it's not even like the soft fabric you know what they probably did they probably chose this fabric because it's kind of like sparkly shimmery like snow overall the design is fine you kind of just print his face on it unfortunately he goes yeah the sad face Shelmet this guy's adorable he sits really well too good sit this is a good old guy he's cute he's well formed he sits really well I think it's a good one like straight up to eight here for me and there he goes oh here whoa his little Lips This doesn't quite look like Excel Gore I'll be honest he looks a little more Derpy you know they got his little crossed arms it's just the face that really takes away from me personally he's supposed to be all cool like but his lips of like them it doesn't do it for me no oh to the sad tear he's a cool guy though stun Fisk done Fisk is a Pokemon that's grown on me a lot I think he's so great perfectly because that's what he that's just what he does he's made to sit born to sit really cute I like sunfisk I think there's nothing really to complain about this one with he's it's stun fish hey tier me and Foo oh look at his arms look at his arms he's throwing the double punch is that a sitter I don't know I'm just confused about the arms being up like this what this does for it in terms of the plush it's fine it barely sits without the tail it wouldn't sit it's not bad it's just a little awkward in terms of what he's doing what is he cooking beef here okay this is much better you know he's got the praying mantis stance it's shorter fabric they print it on where it's not as soft sometimes it happens the I would say this is fine it's okay like that's his beat here in you go try to gone whoa what a little Hamburger Helper guy elaborate I don't know it's just his head he's so meaty the body is fine it's just the head that's like very large his teeth are all over the place this poor thing I think they did the best they could I like the texture on the belly good attention to detail but this poor thing's head honestly it's just a little ugly for me I'm a big drudagon fan go let look at how tight he's oh he's cute he's all stand stuff this guy's so round and cute he's very horizontal though I think the detail of his little Stone of just the cut printed fabric is okay I'm just not a big fan of it but I understand like why they had to do it I think it's a good plush he's very orb-like he's very sturdy you can hold him like this like this I'd say this is an a tier right there go lurk this guy he does it it's a no leg day kind of guy his legs are so horizontal he's got his little dress Golurk he's really cute also very orb-like they got his details really good too they printed the spiral he's funny he also gives me like Burger King Vibes you can't just say these things what do you mean oh I got him from Burger King oh Burger King toy yeah okay go lurk I would say dear oh look at his little dangly feet hanyard oh he's got his little little knife on his face and he sits I like I do like his little stabbies the head is a little funny I don't know how they could have done this part a little bit better but it's a little wonky I'll be honest he's not that great but he's very silly and cute that counts for something sad face oh I don't want to I have a big pot I like pawniard but you know fish sharp I think he's gonna fall down to the same fate it's just this thing if you can preserve this in perfectly this straight angle then I think it wouldn't be too bad mine just keeps doing this like a little hair flap I think we put like hard plastic on it just makes the plush a little less plushable though you know yeah it's it's hard for kids to like snuggle up and be like good night it's also just the head it's just a hard Pokemon to design a plush for I think maybe to be a plush he was an action figure kind of Pokemon yeah I agree bufalant here you are oh my God he's cute oh that's a good one he's a little guy grumpy oh my gosh look at this hunch look at this hunch right there I love this guy Buffalo huge fan I love how he just hunches over he's dedicated to sitting and then it looks like this but I think he looks great I'm a big fan honestly I think this is straight up to eight here right there rufflet where is the rough lit oh my gosh I think this is the first time they've used this fabric it's a lot I think I would have preferred it with the buffalo on hair fabric I think it would have been fine I think he looks a little deranged because of this crazy hair everything is fine I'm just not a big fan of this hair fabric I think we can call this re-tier Braviary hello oh my goodness whoa wings out I just want to recognize this is bravery or if I can be real his head is huge it's more like this but I think it's very spherical I do like the floppy wings like this I think it's cute but if I saw this in like a store I'd be like look at this guy and then I put him back um right back in there full of bee I'm not a big Willoughby fan oh but this is cute that makes for a good plush he sits super well I think all the orb like Pokemon really do well in the plush form and vullaby is very orb-like like they could have did this with rough lip I don't think they needed to go all crazy with the hair vullaby looks great I'd say up here and go right there Amanda Buzz oh man the buzz that's a bird it sure is a bird nothing really to say nothing stands out it's just mandibuzz the proportions are the best they could do I think he's very wide a little bit of a refrigerator stance but pretty good baked here they're just like coming forward a little bit more every month falling out but not quite yet heat more oh I love heat more oh they didn't give him his little fire tongue I'm shocked I expected a little skink tongue I feel like they tried but they couldn't make it look good so they just took it off I'll be honest I don't think it has to look good they just have to commit to it I don't think that's been their concern for some of these uh the claws are really good actually they're not just they're like individually sewn claws just like the foul the felt printed out like that I think he's really good his arms are a little dangly though good guy the way they printed this fabric here it's kind of the red has come off so I think that's a little off-putting for me but if you don't care about this then I think it's a great keep more plush it's a good shape where do I put him now I'm biased and like not putting them in B tier you can just put them in B tier yeah you'll make it work no no no no no no it was a matter of time Durant and his little spindly legs oh he's very long he's like a little train his face is funny I think this is fine I just don't think Durant is meant to be a very cute plush like this is a plush Durant but it's not a cute plush in general be tear I can fit him in he is small Dino he's a cute guy that's not a beach here no he's not I like how they have his mouth open and everything he might do his party he sure is actually Dino POG great plush nothing to say a tear the wireless is next oh no it's hard when you have two heads to work with I think he's a little I think they made it work I think they made it work he's a little scrunkle but I think he's good it's a little goofy but I think it's supposed to I had to rank him if I have to rank him it'd definitely be a tier for any reason in particular I think they earned it hi July to run oh this is one of those designs where let's just see lot going on here and they they committed to all of it does he sit his little oh it's a little Tuffy feet and make him sit oh that's so cute I think there's just a little too much going on unfortunately I'm a huge High Dragon fan I think he could be pulled off in plush form but he needs to be bigger I do like their little guides here wow wow unfortunate a tragic sad tear larvista I'm a huge fan of the larvest this is a cute one oh look at his little face he's a little gut I love when they're just little footballs he's he's just good that's just Larvesta I think these are really sturdy they're not flopping around he is a unit he does not flop I love his little face I think this is a tier yeah [Music] Volcarona is one of my favorite Pokemon oh I think they did a good job with them I feel like they could have made Volcarona look very ugly he's also a recliner you see relaxing I love him I love him a lot the wings are nice I like the Ombre color of gradient and he sits in the palm of your hand like this I like it I like it so much that I'm putting him in s tier cabalian they made him sit what a cute guy kobalian's such like a noble Steed that it's it's very endearing to see him sitting like this it's humbling you feel like he's comfortable with you and he's being vulnerable right now but it's a pleasure it's fine it's kobalian nothing like stand out about him I feel like I can make him work right there to wreckion some people call him terracion you I like tarakion they made them all sit I think he's a funny guy he should be like so beefy and strong but instead he's tiny and sitting he is this is also one that you're like you're like soft man for sitting down in front of me I feel like we are bonding because he's sitting down and he doesn't sit for anyone else he looks really good though his face is very round but I think it's good I think it's better than kobalian just in the fact that it was probably easier to make these shapes there you go oh and eight here yeah Parisian oh oh no oh what a 180 that one was oh versus Young's like one of my favorites of the three two she's very colon three she looks like a cat you know looking without the head it looks good and then with the head it's like oh it's just too chibi like Verizon is supposed to be elegant and sharp and edgy and stuff but this is this is like a little round face I think this one goes down here it just doesn't look like Verizon to me tornadoes the Incarnate form he barely sits he's got the the fluffy Cloud but he does have the beans to help him the Therian form looks great though there's a lot going on with him and I think they nothing looks too much or too out of place I think he looks really good honestly both of these look good like I think these are both straight up a tier as complicated designs these are I think they did a really good job with them you can go here and you are way too big in there we got thunderous next this is pretty much just carbon copy of Tornadus this guy though the face is not right I don't know how they did Tornadus the Therian form so well and then thunderous Therian form so bad it's just the face I guess that tail drips it really does how is it supposed to go I don't know how it's about I guess it's supposed to just do this when it doesn't go over the shoulder it doesn't really it kind of just flops around this one's not that great if you are a thunderous fan get the Incarnate form because this is great he is not and he's very big and then you go a tier yeah okay and then the Pokedex weirdly goes Reshiram next and not Landers so we'll do Reshiram it looks really good they did his head really well it's a lot but nothing looks too much they probably Workshop this guy a lot because it's the legendary but he looks good this is so hard he goes in a tier but now a tier is becoming B tier hold him there crussle now we got Zekrom oh wow he looks great all the little sewing lines make him look really good I feel like this is actually a really good Legend yeah these are hard to make yeah like I don't know how they made him look so good his face looks good his wings look good his designs all over the place look good I feel like this deserves s tier because of just how complicated he is I'm just really impressed this is great Zekrom you can go in front of Pansage Landorus time for Landorus the Tails okay we can swing him around like this this part on his head like his log looks so bad on this one but not this one maybe it's because these things hold it down but this is just like large he only looks good from like this angle but if you like do this it's like whoa forehead this is definitely the worst incarnate form of the the three of them the Therian form looks great though I think I'm gonna put him just down here he deserves beats here here but maybe it doesn't he thinks he does he can think what he wants but I like the Therian form actually I think they did a really really good job he looks great and that's why he deserves esteer yeah he does good for him yeah good for T Landorus kierem oh this pile is getting small oh there's three kyurems oh oh they got all the kyurems I didn't even realize yeah okay so kirim his face does not really look good I didn't even like really see it he's like a little um like a pug where his face kind of sinks in a little too much his skin kind of overflows into his face his arms are so small and his little ice arms are also so small this poor thing I think I would be nice to him and be like you know it's hard to get Legend plushes right but seeing how well they did with Zekrom makes me say this is a little bit of a frowny face for me sadly I think it's also just hard to do the face right he's kind of being swallowed by his own ice the Kyurem white design is already a lot and kind of you don't really know what's going on and that multiplies in plush form and then does this guy look any better this is a little bit of a funny face I'll be honest I think they all go in a frowny-face tea understandable I gotta say yeah oh he's got two forms he's he's fine um actually the head is very horizontal and Squishy it looks like he got a little bit clamped like this and then like they removed the clamp and they're like oh he's very very horizontal he's supposed to be much more round I think I guess you can squish him to be a little rounder I think Keldeo is a very cute Pokemon but for some reason he didn't translate the best I think this guy looks a little better and I don't know why maybe it's because they have the cut felt that I don't really like too much but I think this guy goes in think carefully I got it this guy goes in B tier bold just shove them in there and then this guy goes frowny face laying down like that we've got the two meloettas Hatsune Miku does she sit looks like she wants to she sure wants to this one definitely does not it kind of looks like a little bit of a comb over besides the comb over she looks good I I'd say it's good she's soft she's cute dainty of I love her little feet this one's a tier for me this one is also good her legs are cute like that I feel like they're both a tear like that and then you go in here like this one last one after 173 plushes or finally on the last guy Genesect and I bet this dude is not b-tier personally a huge jet effect fan work with me buddy pretty top heavy to be fair it very much is he's got like all his masks up here and then the tiny little stick body I don't think he sits he gotta just lays there like that poor thing me when Pokemon forgets I exist and I'm super cool I love him but he goes down here unfortunately and that's it that's all the Pokemon sitting cuties Gen 5 plushes the entire line with joltec at the very top don't forget about him okay overall thoughts on the line I put a lot of them in B tier but I would say these are just good plushies and then like we're starting with good plushies and then when they're even better then they go higher but I wouldn't say any of these are bad these are the ones I would say maybe make sure you like the Pokemon a lot and you just want a plush of them they're not really the best which is the worst well we've only got one in the Forgotten tier so four things yeah I would say this is a really really solid line I'm really happy I own all of them because I'm insane I'm an insane person thank you Pokemon for sending me all the guys I'm sorry I called a couple of them ugly but I think they all look really good they're really good plushies if you like any of them I would say buy them now after ranking all of Gen 5 of the sitting cuties I started thinking in my head and I was like why stop at gen 5. I wanna rank every single sitting cutie out there you can probably see I bought all of gen 1 already that wasn't even a gift you just bought that yeah I bought those Pokemon sent me these ones and then I I bought gen one because I'm impulsive but Pokemon I would love to work with you and rank all of the plushies gen 1 Gen 2 gen 3 gen 4. we did five gen six when you're out don't do the vavilion wine but yeah thanks for watching stay tuned I'm gonna do it I'm gonna be one of the few people in the world to own all of the Pokemon sitting cuties this is a problem no it's not oh okay this is the line go get yourself a plush if you like any of them I suggest Joltik that's about it thanks for watching"

So you've been studying the quantum realm. mm hmm. Why\u00a0didn't you ask me about it? I tried Mom. Do you even know how dangerous the quantum realm is? No! You won't ever tell us about it. You don't know what you're dealing with down there! It's fine just let\u00a0me turn it on and show you. Don't you dare turn on whatever that thing is! Why? [Fine!] You really want me\u00a0to tell you? Yes! Tell us! It's so weird that you don't want us to know Fine! [Music] Wow! okay so yeah we won't\u00a0ever do anything with the quantum Realm [Music] Any minute now... someone somewhere out there will\u00a0 send a signal and that's when I'll catch them! any minute now [ant sounds]  My name is Darin! and I am not a... [car horn] what? Did I get him? Luis? Yeah man! What's up? How did\u00a0you get here? Oh man you're not gonna believe it right! So I was just chilling back at the security\u00a0office when all of a sudden these giant ants walked in and I was like whoa are you some kind\u00a0of Highly evolved ants from Beyond Space and Time sent to give me some kind of important message? and\u00a0the ant was like, \"Yeah dawg. We've been trapped down in the quantum realm  getting all super smart\u00a0and stuff and I was like, \"Word?\" and he was like, \"Yeah\" but craps been getting really bad down there and Scott's been getting mixed up with  this evil dude named Kang I said \"Oh no Scott! That's My Boy!\" and the ant said, \"No doubt no doubt\" so after doing like tons of science and  stuff we were like... Yo. You know who is like a really important  missing piece to all of Ant-Man's success? Luis! And all the ants said, \"Yeah we should get him down here  to help save the universe and stuff!\" and I was like, \"For\u00a0real? and the ant was like, \" yeah\" then I was like , \"Wait.\" if you're so smart and you came all this way\u00a0to find me why didn't you just use like your super ant technology  to just bring everyone back home? and the ant said,  \"You want to be in this story or not?\" So I said yes. wow that is incredible [Rumbling] You think these ants... and a van...   can defeat me?! I am Kang! And I still have holes! So the ants and Luis and the talking blob\u00a0translator ooze thing save the day? well yeah basically that's how it went. And what happened to\u00a0 that orb thingy? Oh well the ants being a Class 2 civilization... decided we can't be trusted with such\u00a0 a powerful device so... they took it. And that's good? Of course it is! I love ants. I... I don't ever get\u00a0upset about anything they do. You know what I would have done? I'm gonna guess reboot? What the!  You hush your... Actually... yeah that actually checks out. Rebooting sounds exhausting. Oh it is. But it always works\u00a0 out for him for some reason. Because I'm Batman! Anyways. So you're sure Kang is gone for good? Yeah! I mean we all saw him get eaten I'm sure that's the last we'll see of him What's up Kang? Not a lot, Kang. How you doing Kang? Just Kangin with the Kangs. Kang right! Where my Kangs at? Hey Kang! Where the heck did all of these Kangs come from?! I told you you! [how you been, Kang?] You know what bugs me? When they kept\u00a0taking their helmets off to talk to each other? Yes but no. Is it Re-Castie? Hey! he he! no No the mind reading\u00a0guy. He has this incredible power to read your mind and then all he does is use it to find the\u00a0 combination for a bridge. That's it? Yeah that bugs me. It's just weird. Oh there are a lot of things in\u00a0 the quantum realm that are weird. Yeah. But not you. You look great by the way. Thanks . I was starting\u00a0to think you wouldn't remember me. Oh I would never forget that. He he he he he Oh don't tell me you had a relationship\u00a0 with Batman too! I have needs, Hank! Gross!  Ewe!  Oh my gosh! Give it to me Janet!

Lindsay I mean Lindsay really hasn't changed in 20 years Jacob senior he was an interesting character I would say out of all of us he was probably the the strangest outlier because he was a little bit older than the rest of us and had a kid so I just didn't really know where he was gonna fit in and then he started talking and so I says I've never seen a circumcision like that before you know I think ultimately he sort of helped us with his age um he had kind of a business Acumen that we didn't have and was you know old enough to start a business which was also something that the rest of us couldn't do because of our age he also bought us beer which was pretty cool how did my father Jacob senior get the job at my funama trailers I think this is one of those memories that I think I've latched on to a little bit I remember the word blackmail being thrown around uh I mean Jacob senior was old and I don't know if I could say this now because he's dead but he's so hot [Music] I can remember our first day like it was yesterday we were so excited to create something new something that had never been done before no one in 2009 was touching gaming at all it was toxic okay when you're making video game content there's always a fear that the audience will be ugly nerds which is why I decided to start us with a skateboarding game because I figured maybe just maybe you know that would be cool enough to sort of push away the losers but I mean back in 2009 weird nerds were not the only ones watching like gaming content I mean I it was inspired Myself by watching hours upon hours of Call of Duty montages so you know as a Trailblazer we really didn't have a path to follow so our first strategy was to brainstorm and we we just thought what would make something great what's gonna get views now my initial idea for the setup was to actually have the camera on the ground pointed up at us but it just didn't work for multiple reasons so what I ultimately settled on was putting the camera uh in the corner which at the time was revolutionary okay but where do you want the camera I don't [\u00a0__\u00a0] care it was perfect because it was about us as much as it was about the game right and we could show us playing the game but then also people could see the game and we could put them on the screen at the same time so when you're like watching it and your glasses are falling down your bumpy nose okay you're gonna be enjoying yourself because it like looks cool and you can see them both at the same time before we ever hit record we had to solve the issue of how to record now this is before game capture was everywhere we didn't have Elgato we didn't have these streaming devices it wasn't that easy we didn't know how like to basically make the video of the gameplay how to put game in video I was like let's just draw it she just said over and over again maybe it would be easier to draw it and no one knew what that meant and when we asked her she could not elaborate at all the most difficult part I think was figuring out how to record but James figured out a method where he would simply stop and start the camera with each joke this basically meant that every few seconds I was hopping out of my chair to hit stop on the recorder only to hit start again and then jump back in hoping no one would notice that I was out for a frame or two he called it claymation reality people don't realize that the rules for making claymation are basically the same rules for everything else the gameplay wasn't all smooth sailing though we actually ran into a lot of friction during the recording we kind of got into an argument about who the best black eyed pea was I just got two words for you pump it I just remember there being like this weird tension between James and Patrick and they were just like beat on their chest each other and it would go on forever it would never stop they would like go in circles they would be jumping off up and down off the couches like rolling around on each other like when you put two Silverbacks in the same enclosure at a certain point you're gonna you're gonna run into trouble A lot of times Patrick and I would be talking over each other racing to make the same joke at the same time it actually there was one moment too where I was about to say something funny and he he landed a blow to the back of my neck that just shook me and and then he finished the punch line which is honestly what hurt me more let me start by saying uh there was always mutual respect there and that doesn't mean that there wasn't conflict it's true we talked over each other and would often try to race to the punchline but the way I remember it is I was just wrapping up a joke and approaching the punchline when he actually picked me up over his head and threw me as hard as he could into a pillar in the middle of the room and actually broke my back in two places I mean when you look at fun house now it's obvious that I'm the funniest and have been for years but back then it wasn't always the case I was young I was fresh I was honestly a little nervous luckily Jacob senior was there that guy was funny Jacob senior and I think people forget this incredible when it came to timely humor whether he was making cracks about Obama being sworn in or swine flu everything was a banger it's who I says whose Jewels I gotta juggle to get some cream around here but for me Bar None the funniest joke that he made and maybe the funniest joke I've ever heard was about how Slovakia had recently adopted the Euro I mean the amount of jokes this guy told about that and every single one of them hit talk about Slovakia boom another hit they're down in the lowlands along the river Danube and his tributaries boom another one right out of left field and he just they kept coming I gotta say Slovakia King of the dacians stop some of the slovakians uh you probably would not be able to say that no but back then oh he was just so cheeky what not nothing it's a good joke [Music] so we post the gameplay online and then we wait but we don't have to wait very long because almost immediately we notice this is getting some traction people are watching this thing so we're sitting there staring at the views and that number keeps going up 50 60 70 1 million it just kept getting bigger and bigger and like I didn't even know that there were a million people alive at a certain point I had to stop and grab Lindsay and explain to her how numbers work I I know how numbers work it's like two four 15. I had never seen that many zeros in my life we're talking millions and millions of views and only in a few short hours this is our first day oh man after that one single video blew up we we moved immediately out from our uh the duplex we were in into a huge house gay community we had a pool with a diving board there was a trampoline women were mailing Jacob senior their used panties and men were mailing him their used condoms and we had a robo Butler that was the craziest thing who I think would just take over all the fatherly duties when my dad was off trying to make more videos for that one fleeting moment though we were gods of an industry we had endorsements coming in left and right now I know what you're thinking you were living in a storage container at the Wharf beforehand uh and suddenly this video blows up well I've always been wealthy even when I was living in the storage container that was a choice that I made so the money really was nothing for me there's never been anything I couldn't buy it felt weird to be recognized for sure and I remember going down Hollywood Boulevard and there were people in shitty costume versions of me and I was like this is weird and then I had to pay them two dollars to get a picture with myself without a doubt we were Pioneers in our field and so we said this is a media hole we can fill and I think knowing that everyone appreciated that and was willing to take that risk meant that we were going to hit a big home run little did we know that home run was going to become a foul ball we tried to post other videos hundreds of them thousands but they just didn't catch on and the truth of the matter is I'm not sure we knew how we made the first one so you have to understand we started at the top right and then we just couldn't seem to recapture the magic the views never quite got to that level of the first video we just kept trying to do the same thing you know follow the same recipe make something amazing that everybody would love but I guess you can only make one joke about Slovakia and then it's like not funny anymore Jacob senior took it the hardest because he was old and he didn't have that much time to keep trying he'd come home he'd come home Angry and frustrated more and more frustrated every single day and I'd asked Papa what's wrong and he would just stare off in the distance and say that's a goddamn slovakians and eventually you know we just bought him a single ticket on a Disney family cruise never saw him again I heard he died at sea with a butt full of I shouldn't say anymore it was the next day that we shut the channel down for good ultimately we decided we had to call it quits 6 p.m and they were cutting the power to the building so you can imagine my surprise when Funhouse started and suddenly I'm reunited with all my old co-workers and Friends well some of them working with my dad's old co-workers um yeah I try not to think about it too much there have been a few times where I've tried the brochure subject because they worked with them and I figured maybe I could learn some tips from the old man but they always just kind of shut down I saw Patrick's eyes water once I've never seen that before like tears were welling up and yeah it's rough I think it's maybe he was a dad to all of us or none of us despite the highs and the lows I would never trade those moments for anything in some ways it was the greatest time of my life way better than now we're celebrating 20 years of Rooster Teeth Gus so that's a lot of years that's a long time click here somewhere to watch more exclusive 20th anniversary content is that the longest you've gone without being fired yes it is me too high five yeah"

existence really hard to continue my quest it's still a ways but what exactly are you looking for Kind part to explain piece of a crystal and it's really important that I find it hopefully a shallow will be able to help you she's the smartest woman I know who's inshallah she leads the people I live with does she know it's making animals sick no one does not even the wildlife researchers they say this could destroy our whole ecosystem if we don't do something I used to work in an animal shelter I wonder if I could help right now we're looking for a miracle we better move faster some will be setting soon what happens when the sun sets the animal s some are very dangerous and unpredictable because of the sickness oh no the Sun is going down don't worry I'll be okay I wasn't kidding Aisha we're in danger [Music] thank you [Music] Tanya you know better than to be out after Nightfall I'm sorry inshallah I was tracking that lion and she ended up rescuing me I'm Aisha and I apologize if I caused any problems let me take a look at you why it is as if I was looking at my own reflection 50 years ago I remember my mom telling me about my grade on a shower do you think yes it is a sign you are home [Music] Tanya told me about the animals this is a dark time for us the animals represent our future when they cease to exist so shall we that is why you have come to learn to reach your potential to Deliver Us from this great time of struggle you are the chosen one but I would say I will send questify [Music] my personal Talisman when I am unsure I give it to you now in hopes that you will stay [Music] this is what I was in here to find we were told that there would be a time when it would save us perhaps that day is here [Music] I don't know about this yes we are we have to go back where Tanya originally found me beware it [Music] say Journey little one so we're done I'm getting a signal through the time hole it's Aisha who's that with her she has the crystal prepare for transmission and teleportation it's time to bring Aisha home what if I don't fit in what if they don't want me they'll love you as much as I do Aisha do you have the crystal in your possession is that Zordon Jordan This is Tanya I'm sending her back with my crystal I have to stay here with my knowledge of animals in my experience as a Power Ranger I know I can help find a cure for this plague my instincts told me this would happen with one of you we accomplishments I'm not gonna say goodbye you guys I love you and being a part of yours meant everything to me we all feel the same about you Aisha your decision to remain has altered the course of your family's history and you will find that they have joined you when the world is returned to the Future yes I knew I was making the right choice somehow I feel this is where I belong this is the answer to my quest are you ready I'm a little nervous yeah me too you need not be frightened Tanya know that the power will protect you bye I'll make you proud you already have the student I've selected is Aisha Campbell wow I'm so excited that is so great congratulations most power prevention is common sense this morning we're going to talk about the hazards of overloading electrical circuits [Music] never plug too many things into one Outlet like if you're gonna blow dry your hair and you want to use a curling iron also but you want to put on gel first but you know you gotta blow dry it out then you want to use your curling iron again just on the ends wait you put gel on before you curl well girl I do but you can gel after you curl ladies can we get back to the fire safety lecture sorry that looks really dangerous [Music] [Applause] all right Class come back to your seats remember everyone water and electricity don't miss well that should just about do it did you put a penny in the hallway not yet we can't afford to leave anywhere out now when it comes to something as important as fire safety okay okay sorry we'll do that yeah um listen I gotta go to the park and meet the guys for a run so well if you're going by the mall could you put some flyers up yeah no problem Oh and at the library also in the gas station and the video Arcane thanks come on everybody let's see how the kitchen looks thank you listen I think I used to take this thing a little too seriously yeah I agree no come on you guys it's a very good opportunity for it I think she's doing a very good job well how did I do pretty good I only found a couple of problems they're good these are minor things I'll get them fixed by next week there's no such thing as minor problems when it comes to fire safety next week could be too late I guess you're right Aisha I'll get on it right now great Ernie [Music] well Ernie seems genuinely concerned I'm responsible for the safety of everyone here I can't afford to take any chance of chances yeah we never made it to the mall well you better get going if you're gonna go to the library also are those exercised properly posted you guys stay here with Alpha and find some kind of way to defeat this horrible monster uh no actually Aisha I think all of us need to go help Tommy Rocky and Adam please guys this is my responsibility Aisha let me help you we need to get back to the park the monster could burn down the whole city Aisha I let you go to the park so you can learn an important lesson many times in life situations arise that require clear thinking and to be brave enough to seek the help of others so then I'm responsible I agreed to be fire safety Captain you accepted that position under ordinary circumstances but now you must realize that we are in great danger it is your responsibility as a Power Ranger to understand that teamwork is the only way to defeat the forces of evil that's right there's no I in the word team yeah you know what we're there for each other always I guess I got a lot to learn about being a Power Ranger we can create energy barriers to turn back the flame I can't believe that's great do you see my name I guess not hey you should wear that you know what this has got to be a mistake because Angel Girls Club is for people who are dedicated to their community and you have perfect for it apparently some people don't think so Veronica okay Kimberly is okay not that important see you later she hates me I don't know what I've done but Veronica flat out hits me and that's why I didn't make a club why would Veronica hate you as far as the club is concerned I have no idea why you didn't get in but you know what I'm gonna find out okay because my family's not rich enough and here I thought we were doing great we've got a nice house I don't need anything oh no it's ridiculous I just wanted to be honest with you I can't believe there are people who think money makes you a better person it's disgusting anyway that's why I quit the club I did judging people no matter what the reason is just totally uncool you didn't have to do that I know thanks that means a lot where you going home my grandmother's in town remember oh yeah I want to meet her I promise to spend some time with her it'll give me a chance to think things over well just remember that your real friends love and accept you for who you are I know thanks okay Bye Bye Bye Hello darling it's so glad to see you my have a seat let me see what you are Aisha what's wrong it's nothing Grandma Aisha it's just this club at school they didn't let me in because Mom and Dad don't make the required amount of money do you really want to be part of something that treats people that way honey no but it just hurt my feelings kind of made me mad you've got to be strong and confident inside and Rise Above It All you understand some people have very small minds this is for you [Music] Grandma it's beautiful thank you thank you that's been in our family for Generations whenever you feel down you'll have this to remind you how much I love you and remember love conquers all [Music] what was that um it was my alarm there's a meeting I forgot about okay darling we can visit some more later so I know what's up more Zen's hate master has poisoned the minds of the other rangers they now believe they hate each other well maybe I can talk to them and break it when the hate master has you under a spell you've got to snap out of this trance can you mind your own business please yeah who invited you here anyway yeah you're a joke just like the rest of you what's going on last thing I remember is fighting tangas the one off we gotta move fast hate matches oh man I'm sick tired of being sauron's little puppet Tommy all of you please just listen to me now I don't understand why I'm unaffected by this but you guys are under hate Master spell um can you stop whining please because I'm getting really sick and tired of listening to you I'm getting tired of listening to all of them talk to Zordon he'll explain yeah we'll talk tomorrow right chest stand in line big man zordon's a joke um like the rest of you guys you guys don't know what you're saying hey Master's done we must find what it is that kept Aisha immune from hate Masters hate dust I'll have you found anything yet not so far Aisha it's nothing it's coming from Aisha's necklace it's a it's emitting some kind of strong energy wave my grandmother gave me this necklace according to my readings this Stone has been absorbing the energy waves of those who have handled it yes its energy appears to be made up of Love generosity and caring those powerful energies must have acted as a shield against us we've lost all power swordon's gone we've lost the backup generators too what's happening it's no use I can't restore power to the main generator or to any of the backups and that means no Zordon could have caused this not what who there's only one person who's familiar with our entire command system Billy he knows everything about these computers doesn't he yes and that makes him dangerous to us all the Power Rangers are potential threats now unless we can find an alternate power source I'll be unable to transport anyone in or out we'll be trapped here forever Lord Zed's really done at this time hasn't he probably what he wants I wish to hate him but but wait a minute that's it what's it Alpha how much power would it take to teleport me out of here a minimal amount and if I got out of here I could find I was blocking the power and I could shut it down but Aisha we don't even have the amount of power to teleport you out oh yes we do you of course I'll connect my circuitry into the main computer and use my power to get it operating excellent I'm ready here goes [Music] oh okay it's working yeah yeah and now I'm able to pinpoint the source of the power blockage it's coming from the juice bar get me there and I'll shut it down but Aisha I don't have enough power to get you all the way to the youth center we'll teleport me to the park and I'll make it from there here take this without your necklace you will no longer be protected from the hate Masters evil particles if I'm able to restore the power to the command center you're gonna need my necklace in order to block the hate Master spell on the Rangers you're a real Power Ranger Aisha teleporting now please [Music] [Music] never done this stuff [Music] hey where you going [Music] what's going on around here hey yellow ranger we finally meet my unfriendly tinga got the stuff from your feet the Earth that you touch I needed collected so the heat that the maid couldn't be perfected I wrote it in my hands to get the right dose not everything you love you see you'll really be gross breaking you down is part of the production join your Ranger friends on the path of self-destruction no come on Yellow Ranger you can't resist your feet surrender right now and give in to the hate give into the hate I won't listen to you there's no reason to continue your persistence the sounds that you are the cracks in your resistance it's not too late you learn to hate I'm in rap give in you've got to be strong and confident inside and rise above it all and remember love conquers off the concrete song how could this be what's happening to me well let Hey control me my grandmother taught me better than that will you stop are you harping I need to go rest I need to recharge see you later power passed doesn't prove anything you guys are great athletes with awesome skills but those skills should not be used to hurt each other or anyone else it's a gift and should be used only in sport with honor and dignity you guys are friends we all are why should we hate each other such a waste Aisha yeah guys guess what what Diana from the club asked me if I wanted to join what yeah when they found out I didn't make the list Diana and the other girls launched an investigation and they found out that Veronica was rejecting a lot of other girls based solely on their family's income so they asked her to resign oh that's great so you're gonna do it or what well only if my best friend will join with me honor acceptance and service and standing by your friends is what the angel Girls Club is about and Kimberly's definitely that I would love to"

      "corpus": "hello everybody my name is Markiplier and I'm here to tell you that we're finally done filming iron lung this has been a very long journey and it's a journey that has taken way more time than I ever thought it could but we are finally done and that means that I can finally get back to making videos I've been missing it a lot I've been missing it a lot more than I ever thought I would um just the regular routine of making videos getting interrupted by going out and filming something even bigger technically still making a video just one very big intense video but I'm finally done and it's great to be able to commit yourself to something so fully and I can't wait to tell you more about it and I know you have so many questions about it and I'm unfortunately not going to be able to answer a lot of them but I can tell you I am incredibly proud of what we are making here I still have to edit it there's still post-production there's still time in between now and when it finally gets released but this was a new one this was another level this was just crazy if you've been watching my channel long enough you know that I often go off and I make these crazy projects and then I release them and then you can see them and all the hard work that goes into them is insane and for some reason I convinced myself that this one wouldn't be nearly as much effort as say in space with markiplier or heist with markiplier or any of the other things that I've done but honestly it was so much more in a good way and in a bad way but mostly in a good way in a bad way because I wasn't able to tell you guys anything I wasn't able to keep up with content I wasn't able to paint the picture of the story of what is going on behind the scenes but I'll tell you that I am incredibly proud of the stuff that we're making I'm incredibly proud to be able to bring this game to life in a movie like such an incredibly rewarding experience but my God has had taken a lot of my time there were so many crazy things that went into these past few months that I can't even put it into words not that I could tell you right now because a lot of it would be a big fat spoiler but in addition to just filming the movie so many other things landed in these two months I talked about that in the other update videos but it's just insane that it all happened now like the Spotify thing distractible go the brand deal with this like Creator clash and on top of that the various other things and the movie like I've wanted to record videos so badly but I I literally woke up went to go film got back home planned for the next day and then went to bed that is my entire life that was my entire life for the duration of filming this movie and now it's done like I can't even believe it's done I can't wait to get back home and I can't wait to get back in recording videos again I can't wait for the uh just this simple routine of making videos on YouTube and making videos for you guys because I'm making this for you guys obviously I mean you know that this movie is just another project that I want to push myself on and learn new things and I have learned so many new things and I've opened up my eyes to so many new possibilities of other things that I can make the the educational experience and the kind of inspirational experiences Ben is is I don't know I just it's awesome to be able to work with such a good crew it's awesome to be able to translate this game into another version so that you guys can enjoy it it's it's great to be able to push myself it was great to be able to release that teaser trailer and if you don't know what I'm talking about I released a teaser trailer for iron lung last week and you guys I mean you guys went nuts you guys guys but in a good way I know that you guys are usually going ape for one thing or another but it was really really cool to see the response to this one it was like and and Beyond just you guys Beyond just normal uh YouTube hype there were articles written about this the teaser trailer the fact that I was making this movie the fact that this was getting put into a movie in the first place like there were actual articles from news organizations and like 30 different Publications made a story about it and it got to the top of the movie subreddit like it was talked about and people were making wild conjectures about what the movie could possibly be and I can tell you that even even in my wildest imaginations of what it would be as I was writing it it is it is so much more I can't wait for all this I've never been more excited about making things I've never been more excited about getting back and doing videos again I've never been more excited about making these kinds of bigger projects it was hard it was extremely hard but it was also extremely rewarding which is my favorite it's my favorite Crossroads of those two things something that is very difficult and challenging but is incredibly fulfilling and rewarding and that's all I've ever wanted out of making stuff on the internet that's all I've ever wanted about making stuff in general it's all I've ever wanted out of my life is to have something that was tough but rewarding and like I just really truly appreciate the opportunity to do it and I know that you guys are eager and you want to know more about it and you want me to answer all your questions and you have so many questions but just be patient wait a second the answers will be there soon and you'll get all you need to know very very soon but for now I need to get back home and I need to work on the edit because I am editing it there's a lot of post-production to do David the developer of the game he has been involved every step of the way Andrew holshold who is an incredible composer is going to make the soundtrack and he made the the piece of music that was in the teaser trailer just this incredible haunting piece then just I wanted to make sure that that teaser trailer was something special that would not only showcase yes we're turning the game into the movie but also to Showcase it's going to sound incredible because this movie is based in sound obviously there's visuals components to it um the story and everything but rest assured it is going to sound unbelievable the amount of people that have dedicated their time and their efforts and their skills into this project is like more than I ever could have hoped for and it's all to make a better movie for you guys to enjoy you guys will be able to see later this year I'm gonna edit it as soon as I get home I'm gonna get started on the edit then post-production you know visual effects sound music all of it's going to come together and then you guys are gonna see it on a big screen that's kind of crazy I wanna I wanna set a standard you know I want to set a standard for myself I only ever want to set new standards for myself to send goals to uh Chase to explore new ideas new things I've never tried before I've learned so much about myself and doing these things and I still have so much left to learn and that's both scary and exciting but I know I said I was going to keep

need to cut the apples do you know what we can use to cut the apples um it really is like Dora the Explorer I don't think we're supposed to do that by ourselves why it's always good too you're by yourself what to a certain degree uh don't do that that's not good that doesn't seem safe you're right woolly oh we have almost everything we need did they cut the apples they look fully put together still the neighbor's house ah um okay there's a picture of a pie on the fridge so maybe it's stuck if you want to help me girl you need instructions on where to store Sugar I thought she was saying an option to find the sugars in the oven when the whole time the cabinet was right here cinnamon I wish it's great okay it's time to bake a pie all right let's bake it preheat the oven I'm not sure Lily 425. preheat the oven to 400. don't forget that number all right easy put it in the oven for 40 minutes for 40 minutes 4 25 for 40 minutes bye all right so I did see an oven and a timer so what if we bro that oven was not there earlier we have to remember how to make this pie so we're going to turn on the oven it was four 25. we're gonna cook it for 40 minutes gotta get oh that's a strawberry we want apples we're gonna cut the apple and put it in there do we just literally put this flimsy Apple in here we're gonna see what happens that's not how you make a pie guys I think we're missing some ingredients oh whoa that was cool all right Aunt Kathy or whatever your name is I'm doing this for you [Music] you introduced yourself earlier what am I supposed to answer okay I like that there are so many friends in my neighborhood today I want to send something special to my friend all right you know where the store is so all of these are stores but I guess we're gonna buy the card at the corner store thank you what kind of card should I send them a sad card or now you're happy so now you're happy so she's happy now it's not their birthday oh oh oh that's that's right I found the perfect card my big brain for the next time do nice things it's important to think with bread I want to get my friend only a loaf of bread hopefully where can I buy a treat from my friend we're just gonna eat our feelings get some bread tree everything smells so good Chef has seen better days I want to buy my friends some cookies can you show me where the cookies are why did it glitch like that and everything looked really creepy all of a sudden I mean this is a cookie so tasty oh my gosh the package is ready for my friend they live pretty far from me oh we need to send it wow it's getting late most of the stores are closed we probably can't send that now I have to send this to my friend you can make it to your friend to go to the Post Office guys sorry your name is don't remember that's a bad friend do you help me we can come back tomorrow why would I know your friend's name send that now no I have to send this to my friend I don't know who your friend is package need to go to uh Dora no that's not my friend's name why would I know your friend's name Sarah you have to know their name how Jessica um what's another name that starts is it a boy or a girl I Jess I y'all I didn't type whatever just showed up on the screen I'm not kidding I I really don't know what just was typed on my computer okay guys so I noticed something and I made a weird like when I noticed it there were bolded letters on each store in that little tape we just washed it was c b and F so that's gotta be what this is for right [Music] nice oh no accidents why is the tape named that that makes me feel uncomfortable all right Amanda do your best to make us happy [Music] what happened oh Lily had an accident that's why it's called that accident is when something bad happens [Music] just tell me what happened it can happen in your house at school at the playground yeah you can get her almost everywhere we were playing tripped and fell oh no look like he got her his knee excited about that help when you are hurting me doctor I'm shocked I got that right which room [Music] I don't know if you know this about me but before I was a YouTuber I was an emergency room nurse so I've got this I know what it looks like when you break a book give Willy let's do it it hurts 's injury hold on the heart monitor the X-ray machine or at the scale Amanda just told bully there's not a doctor around that they're not there so I'm getting mixed signals also guys I'm gonna write this down so at the beginning of this she said they were playing at 3 45 I believe and that's when he woolly hurt his knee and then I wrote down 22.50 because I feel like that could be important we have a heart monitor scale and we're going to want to use the X-ray machine here yes let's see the bones wait that's all I wanted to do more medical stuff please hit that subscription button and we can help save wooly because I don't think he's in a good situation now we have a clock I knew this would happen so we have a couple options here we're gonna try 345 as our first option do any of you if you could still time anymore I feel like it's only on like phones and stuff so when I was little you would actually have to learn how to do this but I don't feel like you'll probably do anymore 345. yes mission in this game or I was wrong and it's just alarming there's more to this puzzle all right here's a clock I did write down 22.50 which is technically 10.50 there all right let's retrace our steps there was one place there was a clock that we didn't mention it was right in front of the doors with the bones the heart and the mouth so it's gotta be that time which I believe was we'll see that sounds right satisfying here we go yes that's gotta be the last clock right there's no way there's more clocks help things are off the cork board that were there when we first started tick tock tick tock catching up with Sam wait Sam I don't know who you are but you're a beautiful man I have a key do I just shove it in here ah that didn't seem correct um stab it that thing's evil all right so I actually don't know that this is a key it kind of looks like a dagger or part of a clock were any of the clocks around us missing hand oh there is another clock all right well we've replaced that I noticed this clock over here had change times this is not the time we had said what like 10 50 or something on this before but now it says 5 15 so I'm assuming that is the last code we need for the next tape gotta be this clock reminds me of when I was little we used to have one of these house all right yes guys we have big brains look at what we have done together safe eight to six don't forget that eight two six safe [Music] I love you wooly that's me huh what's your favorite food to eat at a picnic I'm assuming it's apples I don't like that at all wait you liked apple pie what's that smell ew I've never smelled anything like that that doesn't sound good I don't know Willie what yeah oh what do you think is making that bad smell well wooly is a sheep so maybe you know he just smells like a sheep like an animal that's not his fault be you oh we have to point at something there's apples cupcakes and this what is this is that a diaper thank you this tree stump is body too oh cool they are not alive anymore why is she talking about this uh wooly I'm looking at you looking at me looking at you looking at me and I don't feel good about saying this opposite of alive is that that's right yep that's right it's dead dead and opposite of alive this is what happened to our aunts that's never good thank you wooly please distract her [Music] body I can't do this what do you think guys I don't if you don't know me at all I have the biggest heart for animals and I hate this so much he's by the bush I'm just gonna say the berries okay we're just gonna click and not look at stuff it wasn't that oh my head it's funny you did Amanda woolly I don't think it was you 'd be nice if he could tell us yeah bring him back to life I'm missing something the berries oh this didn't even know what got him until it was too late I don't like that Amanda this is going too far thank you talk some sense into her yeah we did sandwich [Music] Mr buff this is the worst picnic I've ever been to in my entire life why Amanda get some water it feels far away oh [Music] no what do you mean plastic answer my question you don't have to no not everything rots uh wait what would I say to this do you think everything rots no and yes do not fit in these bars no see everything is fine here that I didn't say what they wanted everything's fine wooly is not fine okay now we're moving and I'm not doing anything we're looking at scary doll what was that it's siren head a demigorgon I'm I'm done for I'm gonna get eaten I know we died but we're back and look this Dilly bobber's back remember we got a code 826 to open a lock box but at that point it was still a cardboard box I don't really understand how this happened and who has been how about this yes what do we have here oh all right a note red orange blue but wait there was a paper over here on the bulletin board with those weird symbols on it can we join it on okay so it's some sort of color code and also it says potato and potato is not a color but you should put a potato Emoji in the comments [Music] um what is this a jelly bean this is a medicine this goes to a clock wait there was part of the TV kind of sparking I wonder if this is like a cap see the little Sparks here plug oh wait it's the pause button okay now we can pause these crazy videos maybe we can can find something we weren't noticing before here let's watch the video see if there's anything new now that we have respawned I think we played through all the first challenges today we're going to make an apple pie all right first we need to cut the Apple let's cut some apples do you know what we can use to cut the apples guys pause pause that oven was not like that before it is burning hot with a pause button over it so I think that means we need to go turn on the oven we have paused the game we're going to turn the oven on to what was it 425 right all right I turn the oven on the tape moved yo this is not where we paused what is happening there was not a fire before what I'm what that's all we got okay oh okay the oven moved there's now cheese and meat pie meat that's vague what kind of meat are we talking we need a potato a mushroom and meat preheat the oven to 525 in a pie tin mix with meat potato and mushroom bake for 50 minutes and enjoy all right let's preheat 525 right uh so I mean we have the cheese put that in the pan so we just need meat and a mushroom oh the mushroom was over here all right we have cheese we have mushroom now we

candy then yes okay this one this one guts okay guys we have a new word to use with some sort of lock it's guts and then it says cut off of doll's head that's disturbing let's just try to find a lock this one Maybe no those are numbers so we need guts Sarah what about this one hey u t guts oh [Music] so this is disturbing at the end of that little beautiful page here it has scissors with that doll being killed so unfortunately I know the doll is right over here well had been y'all that that doll had just been right over here right am I crazy what is in here all right let's see what this says we have scissors and a new tape there we go what do we have hi friends [Music] because he is a sheep wow can you make a sound like a sheep wow yeah sound just like me severe thunderstorm warning emergency alert system there are lots of animals here to pet and play with wait hold on there's just some sort of tornado alert should we be worried I spin meal was not here before did the alarm go off literally for this thunderstorm or tornado I I don't know I guess we're gonna click it and find out is that bad um we've got a thunderstorm what happens now okay so I spun the wheel and got a big thunderstorm so hopefully that'll protect us I don't know it's fun to spend time with animals they are very different from people it's true they look different and they don't talk like people Amanda true I'm an animal dumb talk silly rude look at these signs let's make sounds like the animals oh no are you ready I'm ready beautiful a chicken says you can get Chuckles from freemers.com [Music] okay I don't think I needed to click off there that just scared me do you have a family animals have families I think I should tell her let's go see one of the animal family I want to see the chicken

you know what the daddy is called a dad chicken dad daddy chick oh oh tornado warning guys pause I think we need to to spin the wheel again and make sure we get a thunderstorm that's the only thing I know to do I think whenever it says a tornado is coming yep that helped save us pretty sure now that we got thunderstorm instead of tornado I think we can watch again sure [Music] thank you Amanda eat their babies okay well that was messed up why is the barn breathing it's time to visit the Sheep guys I don't know wooly looks concerned I love wooly so we're gonna go towards snakes I don't want to see those they're scary well you're bullying wooly oh fine then we'll go see spiders flooding warning okay we're gonna pause again I feel like we need to spin the wheel again you're gonna spin the wheel I don't know what's gonna happen is it gonna make the flood go away hopefully that prevented the flood I don't know okay slowly family they're so cute yeah he's back to normal oh no [Music] pause recommends that you remain calm and don't um I think we just have to keep making sure oh it was still on thunderstorm I think we would have been okay am I a little kitten where is your family love on him it looks like this kitten is all by herself how do you think she feels [Music] sad alone [Music] of course I will yes what is that face for what is happening back there [Music] guys are facial expression I just got chills I was asked to save a kitten I said yes then all the Sheep started making noise and everything paused okay guys I think I missed something I think we're gonna have to re-watch this pause it and spin the wheel anytime an alarm pops up essentially okay severe thunderstorm warning so now that that's there so I'm Gonna Roll this it didn't do that last time that was creepy all right now it's on tornado okay so now we're gonna play this again and then pause it next alert that comes up funny films no that's not what they're called try pause we have a tornado warning so now it's time to spin the wheel I think this is looking good so far a tornado goes to creepy so we should only need one more spin I think yeah whatever that is I guess a blizzard I think it's time to visit the Sheep no okay no I'm on woolly side and he doesn't want us to we're not going to do this to wooly flood warning one last roll hopefully this will do it ladies and gents I'll do it are we gonna be lucky oh a spider crawled out of that that was creepy but we got a tape there we go everything rots we're on to this one hi again I'm woolly [Music] you think is making that bad smell I don't know is it is it you Amanda it's you oh that looks fine I pointed to you what about these are you doing this on purpose no Amanda are you doing this on purpose it is making that that's you oh whoa whoa whoa that looks like a heart in like an intestine or something well it did not look like this before did you see that you know what the opposite of alive is you're look at the tree some if it's not alive what is it no you're that oh when an animal dies it rots too it looks like this kitten is in big trouble we'll save him die before anyone wait no for real I hate that yes that actually legit bothers me yes guys guys yo save the cat did I save the cat I clicked on the cat did I save the cat what's this something moved I think the trap doors open oh this doesn't look good I don't think I'm supposed to be here I'm not a piece of me am I a piece of meat currently I literally think I turned into like brisket or something this happened before I think there's only one more round until we can fully suss this out okay so like the other times we have died we have come back but some things have changed what I'm gonna first do is look in this toolbox see if there's still a tape in it um what was this good I think there open cool so we still have the tape but we didn't use the scissors last time so I'm wondering oh yeah because we're gonna use it like on the doll like the the little book showed us to do but the doll was gone now it's back oh that felt weird I'm sorry doll that's just what I was instructed to do okay that's what I was supposed to do okay there's no way that we're supposed to do that for nothing I mean is there something to me oh she had AAA batteries in her head there's a few things around here we haven't used like this robot who I don't think had power oh well where do I put the batteries in the back there we go I knew it that's it I am yeah yeah it's gonna be really fun okay two two I don't know talk to me robot maybe another time what's that mean I remember there was a code in the neighborhood earlier and I never wrote it down because I didn't think we would need it but I think we may it was in the convenience store let's play it 1503 and 25 cents try 15 oh three two five lift off send my condolences to Kate Katie wait why is this this is only being told I feel oh is the TV broken let's watch it let's see if something changed I don't want to play anymore right now oh that's it all right okay a cake this is beautiful is it happy birthday is this for woolly remember it's supposed to be wooley's birthday congratulations you're one year older wishing you the bestest year yet there's a Code zero eight one or it's zero eight eight two or it's zero eight one eight two one maybe we put it in the robot again zero eight one okay oh [Music] yes sir so we're gonna put this big cake in this oven so 325 oops 325 for 30 minutes wait what am I what am I putting in there maybe just use it as a timer oh whoa it spits something out it's bit out a candle and it spit out may your year be filled with many blessings love blabot okay one times four five minus one oh all right so we have to do some math so 1 times 4 is 4. 5 minus one is four one times one plus one equals two one divided by one is one one plus one plus one is three um and then one minus one is zero I hope I did the math right [Music] what what's in the card is on the cake the candle I feel like we need this candle right what's in the card is on the cake we put the candle there I'm thinking two candles are on the cake so that means this candle icon is two here two times four which is eight five minus two which is three two times two which is four plus one which is five two divided by two which is one right two plus two is four plus two is six and then two minus one is one I hope this is right math c c d c c d c f e c c d c f e yes I got another candle oh it's melting [Music] the cake is totally melting another there's another tape I literally have chills okay so that person turned three whoever that was congratulations I'm gonna take this oh no accidents tape and watch it because it just came out of the cake I don't have much time oh you trust me yes yes [Music] when a friend has an accident sometimes nobody can help them but we can try I'm fine see look at me is good oh our Lily is so confused we need to help him well he's fine we have to know what is wrong nothing his knee was hurt earlier yeah you could be wrong um his head Lily's head is broken all right prepare Amanda no he doesn't need your help no don't drink it I don't know Amanda no don't do it just pretend isn't it Lily oh no he's gonna die no wooly you should have known I need to operate immediately my goodness none of them I just like really don't want to do any of this um we're gonna use this that might be but there's only two other choices we're this one things could get really messy if we use that okay but it won't if we use a hammer [Music] Amanda we know you're crazy don't hurt him oh geez no I'm not helping you Amanda I will help Lily no what am I supposed to do help wooly you're not going to help me no I chose wooly oh okay well that was horrible it's time to watch another tape wait what's it say Riley's fun movies I think is what it says I don't feel good about this this is creepy okay well that didn't really do anything did it there's a tape on the trap door was he here before I am afraid to walk too close to it yeah I'm allergic to Apple yes whoa mushrooms how many this is creepy am I supposed to get information out of this so those are the four numbers we need to open this dresser that's gotta be it so how many chairs one okay I wrote it down chairs mushrooms fruit lights mushrooms there are now one two three four five six seven eight so one eight fruits one two three four five one eight five and then lights how many lights are there one two two all right okay I have to have this wrong so I said one for chair but maybe a sofa is a chair so it'd be two two eight five two what about the fruit I feel like I missed a fruit I said five the earlier there was a hidden fruit one two three four five yep there's a hidden fruit so it's six two eight six two yes oh that felt so satisfying so we have another tape some jackets and a bucket I'm gonna take the tape first home movies we're so close I can feel it you whoa whoa I just experienced so much just now I think this has got to be the last tape there's like 27 cryptic messages in there I think Amanda just told us to die and Woolly he's not doing well the code she said was four zero one two five eight it's what guys okay so I think this robot just said there's treasure in this chest and that it's not on the outside but the inside that matters which I could see in in this situation why he's he's saying that but I think the robot is keeping us from getting in the chest right now the only thing we haven't used is the bucket do you want the bucket oh no that's not how do I use this bucket oh scoop up some water in the bucket yeah did I get some water in the bucket there we go fill it up a little bit all right we obviously have to use this water bucket at some point right and if the robot the robot is preventing us from getting the treasure and he knows it always I will do anything please okay I'm sorry I just have to do it please do not forget me I won't you're a nice robot I just had to I'm sorry whoa the key guys does this mean I get the treasure don't step on the trap door I feel like something's gonna ooga boogers what and Oh I thought it was going to be like gold or something it's books in another tape that's not exactly the treasure I was expecting but all right we can share is what the tape I think said [Music] where's woolly [Music]

missing and authorities still have no leads Colton is the creator of Amanda the adventurer the public access children's educational program that became a huge hit among area children but with Colton's disappearance the future of the show remains unclear huh last year Hamlin entertainment purchased rights to the live action program starring Colton's daughter Rebecca as budget and production value increased Hamlin reimagined the show as an animated series planning to Syndicate the program nationally Hamlin's acquisition of the program and Colton's recent disappearance have raised some eyebrows and to further fuel these concerns new episodes of Amanda the adventurer have had subject matter that has left local parents uncomfortable about the program my kids are still really into that show but it has changed I mean I walked in the other day and Amanda was talking about how mommies and daddies aren't always right I mean what is that it's not something you tell impressionable kids that's not the worst of the channel I just told the kids that the TV was acting up it's not yet clear how Colton's disappearance will affect the involvement of his daughter Rebecca the show's young star we reached out to Hamlin entertainment for an interview while Representatives declined to comment they did release a written statement we at Hamlin have concerns surrounding the nature of Sam Colton's abandonment of both our program and his daughter we cannot speculate on his reasons for leaving we do ask that the community respect the privacy of Rebecca Colton as she needs time out of the spotlight to process these disturbing events for the time being Rebecca's local appearances have been canceled including the kensdale public library fundraiser woolley's readathon this Saturday evening rest assured that Amanda is not going anywhere Hamlin entertainment remains committed to our vision for this cherished program despite this statement authorities have not drawn any conclusions about the nature of Sam Colton's disappearance we will share any future updates as the story develops when we return we'll check in with zappo The Talking gerbil there is to know about Zappo your friend Skip and with me as always is my trusty Dog chip oh thank God I thought that I was going to keep going and I was I was not ready for something like that so did Amanda just kill him then because he was going to do uh a live action version of Amanda the adventurer with his daughter and then Amanda was probably like ah you're not doing this at all without me I'm killing you and I'm well the daughter's still alive apparently and stuff is I don't trust it I think the daughter's gone also I didn't even realize that the letters I spelled out um when I played the song Last Time I don't know if those are the exact sequence that I played them in but they let her spell out facade um and I didn't pick that up last time either see that's why you guys are here that's why the comments are here to hold me accountable because if you're not here to tell me what's going on and what's not going on my brain will just run loose and do whatever the heck it wants um so now we've three out of six okay let's look for more by which I mean let me look it up because how in God's name am I supposed to figure these out on my own how did you guys figure them out I think I actually have to continue the sequence no um I think it was 40 minutes yeah I think I have to continue going to get to certain parts of the game now what episode is this um I forget where you go in the corner store randomly myself just I don't know why the name Kate came to my brain I just wrote it in and apparently I guessed it by accident but Kate was on the letters that I read on the board earlier maybe it's stuck in my subconscious sometimes my brain does not think that way I just managed to guess miraculously yeah what what does it say about Kate uh yeah Catherine perk that's pretty cool that it's all connected hi and Kate thank you so much for the roller skates dad and I went skating in the lake yesterday did any of this stuff mean anything more to me now don't be a stranger I'm your neighbor new blabet only and yeah and I need needed the numbers for that okay um can I spell out facade now [Applause] [Music] no oh now this makes so much more sense the newspaper clipping that was on this board then talks about Sam Colton it's expected to be a father to a town icon but last summer it became clear that his Public Access series amenity Venture and his Title Character were something very special for the self-professed struggling writer it all started with his adopted daughter and a new outlook on life recently I caught up with Sam over a stack of sunflower diners famous strawberry banana pancakes which added about the value of imagination every day adventures and what future may have in store for Amanda Lacey Sam not a date goes by when my kiddos are talking about Amanda and her adventures did you even dream that this little show would be a big hit little show is right isn't it but I think there's something elegant in Simplicity uh we may not have the budget for a big production but I truly believe there's a soul that transcends that I'm probably the way this town has uh that the town has embraced my baby I really am so much of the show is about following your imagination what inspired you to make shows focused on getting our kids that's interesting now it's all starting to fall into place a bit more the lore is actually starting to make sense I still don't know what Amanda is or where she came from or how she came to be but seeing that the show sort of became self-aware and sentient is interesting I forget what the code for this is you have to tell me [\u00a0__\u00a0] off don't you want to be my friend please answer my question I don't know what the question was because I was skipping through but that was cool I think it might be too late wow ah we're about to get devoured no Amanda please don't do it is Amanda even aware that she's a monster I like how her face is basically just evil Mickey Mouse as well ha it's pretty cool hold on apparently if you type in nobody so woolly hurt his knee but if you type in nobody instead of a doctor you're probably right and then new tape a green tape uh let's see if Amanda has more to say though [Laughter] little face oh he's so cute Amanda's like could you believe what happened to my friend it's like a YouTube thumbnail um okay oh wait there's a tape in there I need to finish this one out [Music] boom Molly's all fixed Wally's Not Gonna Die keeps talking about oh Amanda's sentient Amanda can like interact with the kids that are watching the show but nobody talks about the fact that woolly is able to do the exact same thing well he's like hey you gotta help me she knows too much get off the screen coffee break with Sadie Capper or captain welcome to coffee break today I'm talking with Sam Colton the creator of the hit kids show Amanda the adventurer the demon maker a fantastic studio neighbor thanks for having me on the show Sadie you're a pretty good Studio neighbor yourself I am going to gain 50 pounds if you keep stocking the kitchen with those delicious homemade cookies you can't have a coffee break without cookies Sam last year you started producing Amanda the adventurer right here in the studio the whole town loves it did you even imagine that would be such a big sensation honestly Sadie no it was a total surprise I mean it's Scrappy at yeah we have a big idea there is no liquid in that cup I don't know if I know what you're talking about kids don't really care about that though I see the heart boy does your show have a big heart you know I really have to thank our local librarian Miss Kate for being such a champion of the project Kate I think she's talked about it at every single story time I think it's just so rare nowadays for kids shows to be so much fun but also really teach kids something isn't it what inspired you to create Amanda I wanted to create a show that teaches children that our world is a magical place that there are Little Adventures waiting around every corner in their very own neighborhood the show is a celebration of kids imaginations but really it's all Rebecca as soon as I met my beautiful daughter the inspiration was there you know she was so young when I adopted her and despite what she's gone through she's always seen the world with such kindness and joy she's the light of my life and it makes me so happy to share that light with our community she really is something special watching her perform is simply the way I mean the whole show is just so cute thank you Sadie do you see big things happening with Amanda the adventurer I've actually had some people approach me about it turn Amanda into a cartoon I can't really talk about it yet but it's exciting it feels like a dream the idea of welcoming even more kids into this wild creative world it feels like my little show could really have a big impact that's incredible Sam thanks so much for having a coffee break with me today our community is so lucky to have you and Rebecca on our next coffee break four arrangements for All Occasions featuring the newest addition to our neighborhood Rose Matthews of rose's bouquet until then may your coffee always be steaming and the conversation sparkling wait did I have it backwards then [Music] cookies [Music] talking about the cookies again did I have it backwards um I was like oh they created a cartoon and then they wanted to make it live action because that's usually how things go these days and then uh Amanda didn't like that but is it the other way around where they had Rebecca first and then that was that was like the initial show and then they turned it into the cartoon that I'm watching the tapes of Lake Hamlin just decided to make the show anyway because he said that his favorite or he was talking about the cookies and the librarian show or the librarian and Kate works there as she's talked about the show in every single story time so it's like Amanda's just taking on information from the outside world and jamming it into the show because she was talking about Aunt Kate with the cookies interesting okay this should be another one I think a family is nice I see a mommy chicken and baby chickens and I see I see a daddy chicken look at the chicken chicken know what the daddy is called so apparently I'm supposed to put in Sam here because Sam is Rebecca's dad who is the creator of the show wait what did you did you say where should we whoa is there a new tape yeah purple tape there's nobody to love her I don't care about that Amanda we've already done that let's see what's on the tape what Mysteries Rebecca that was great let's move on to the next one uh yeah bye bye pie man Hi man Thai man [Music] what is she reading reverse this script is specifically tuned to train the Technology's Dynamic voice reaction the what I want this to stop so why don't you take a walk for a few minutes we've only got a few more of these I don't like to do that Rebecca what's wrong who are you talking to Merlin the headphones is going too far let's go for five Rebecca come on out and uh so they were recording her interacting with the thing to like basically like an AI to train it oh that was creepy she was saying buy yell pie man hail payment that's at the the end of hereditary maybe it is payment bile sounds like a demon as well doesn't it bio there you go perfectly right at home um maybe she should have been saying like azazo I don't know what that means though buy yell pie man what was the last one they were saying I can't remember okay on to the last tape but something I want to do before I do that that I hope it lets me trigger it people were very upset that I threw the water on blabbit way too quickly he said there has to be a better way okay keep going I am in love with you please have mercy on me Jesus do not hurt me please I am begging you please have mercy on me oh is this a I think it's just repeating now I wish that you remember combinations well people were very upset because I just came over and did that and killed him immediately without hearing that I love you oh that would have made it way harder to kill you but um thankfully I uh don't have a conscience oh there's only five tapes that's all the tapes but there's a sixth slot huh this says there are a total of five Hidden Lore tapes and they each require a different puzzle to get ah man so I did it already that kind of stinks I wanted more so on further inspection of everything um there is no sixth tape people that say there's a secret tape in the game file so let me see uh in a second if I can figure out that and see what that sex tape is but some other observations are that she is saying hymen um pie man is pieman and bye by yell is byel which is another demon I knew that sounded familiar and then the last one was balam which fits in with woolly which is also a demon balam is a demon's name as well and there's there's some interesting theories going on about woolly too people wondering who woolly is and should you actually trust Wally in the whole like wolf and sheep's clothing thing and Amanda's like design when it's the creature and comes after you there's wool over her eyes I thought it was like a bunch of eyes apparently that's wool over her eye so like pulling the wall over your eyes like fooling someone wolf and sheep's clothing woolly being a sheep maybe woolly isn't to be trusted that's a very interesting sort of interpretation of it as well maybe a man does not the bad one after all but we also got the tape of her signing over something which is like signing your soul away to the devil sort of stuff so there's a lot of talk about just demons in general and Amanda herself in the cartoon being a demon and breaking the fourth wall but also yeah woolly being able to break the fourth wall and talk directly to you also is kind of sauce to me um I don't know if they're planning on adding more to this it would be really cool to add more to this lore I'm really interested in what's going on in this and I love the way they've decided to sort of put it out there having it be like a kids show that kids interact with because kids are always interacting with shows every time like Dora the Explorers are she's like can you say boots and then the kids say boots it's like training and algorithm it's like training an AI if it's able to listen to you it's like a chat GPT thing where it's all about knowledge the more you feed into it the more it gets so she talks about like cookies and Aunt Kate and she's just accruing Knowledge from the outside world and it's just maybe she's lonely and sad and doesn't really know what she is and it's like a self-aware AI with a demon in it that kind of doesn't know why it exists and is trying to figure out the world and exists only through these tapes and it's like taking kids it's fascinating I think it's really cool I love the Lord that's going on in this game and I love the way it's presented and the way it's pieced together it's very fun to interact with so this is apparently the secret sixth tape I've seen people like go into the unity Explorer and get the tape that way so you can't you can't just go into the game files and get it it's encrypted into or it's like packaged for Unity so you need Unity to do it and I don't have that but somebody named omnipie uploaded it and it's called herd of mouth with wooly the Sheep it's like a talk show with them [Applause] is this it oh my God it's nine minutes long it's just woolly sitting there so it's okay so they knew people would go searching for a secret tape and it's nothing it's just woolly sitting at a table maybe there's something at the very end uh hmm that evil after all baby Wooly's actually just a sweetheart and the greatest character in the entire game all right all right it's like one or two little scenes that I've missed or a couple of references here and there to certain things that I've missed but overall I'm glad that I got more tapes to explain more of what was going on because that's what I said at the end of the last episode that I didn't know anything about Amanda I didn't know where she came from I didn't know what the whole point of it was and it was in the game I just didn't find it I don't know how anybody found these things uh I don't know what the hints to them are other than like woolly saying he likes peach pie I guess you make a peach pie then that way I don't know but I'm glad I did it I'm glad that there's more to it and we got to figure out more about it but overall that's going to do it for me what a great game I hope they add more to it or create a sequel or just keep that lore going because it's one of the few sort of uh we're in a big uh scene right now where people are making like kids shows or kids things into horror games and we have stuff like the garden of ban ban that does it kind of poorly I think stuff like poppy playtime that does it a bit better but then I I'd consider Amanda to be doing it pretty good as well and it's such a unique way of doing the game that is actually relevant to like an actual kids show in real life and I think that that's really cool I think there's so much room to do so much more with it and I'm excited to see what they do but for now that's going to do it for me thank you guys so much for watching bye bye"

      "corpus": "ah what is that [Music] it's time to make something you enjoyed as a kid a horror game again welcome to Amanda the adventurer now I've played this on the live Channel there was plenty of demos for this and I kind of played both of the most recent versions in one but it was very short it only gave a little kind of snippet of the game whereas this right here is the full version now as I understand it it's like a kids Saturday morning cartoon but they've changed it a little bit dark shall we say so let's just hit stop and let's get straight into it uh dear Riley if you're reading this it means you won't see me again this is starting off real chirpy and happy right I wish I could have told you everything I don't know how much time I have and there is still so much I have to do before I'm gone this letter serves two purposes to say goodbye and to bequeath you my house in kensdale the queen is such a weird word bequeath just makes me feel uneasy I don't know why it even looks uneasy what's going on there this next part may be a mistake and gods forgive me if it is when you settle in there's something in the attic I need you to pass on look for a tape but know that once you watch it there's no turning back stay safe my dear with you always Aunt Kate thank you Kate I love the Aesthetics of this game like the VHS kind of style probably because I grew up with it because I'm old most of you watching this probably uh don't even own I've never owned a VHS tape oh God this feels so fast what okay I remember this attic this attic has a few new things though I don't remember this robot being here I remember the piano I remember the alarm clock let's just go straight ahead and pop this in Amanda in the kitchen this is the uh this is the video I Remember I like the themes

going to make an apple pie okay great we need to cut the apples hmm do you know what we can use to cut the apples oh I see okay yeah this we played this little bit in the um in the demo I kind of know what's going on here we're gonna use a nif yeah I think we're supposed to do that by ourselves we'll eat the voice of reason oh it's good to be brave when you're by yourself whoa whoa put that down disarm the lady doesn't seem safe oh my God [Music] it doesn't look like you cut them to be honest sugar hmm do you know where we keep the sugar the refrigerator or the sink is that what a pantry is is that a an American Wood I'm so confused there is a pie on the fridge but I think it's over here thank you Willie thank you I saw that was quick yep yep okay it's time to bake a pie let's reheat the oven I don't think we should be using the oven by ourselves we should always ask a parent to help I'm not sure I'm sure Willie's voices changed first preheat the oven to 425 degrees got it in my login [Music] for 40 minutes 40 minutes four through five 40 minutes oh wait you've done it already see it seems all like innocent and stuff apart from the The Stance she had with the knife that was quite aggressive this is quite aggressive to VHS play You're Just spitting at me or something unbelievable were you there oh I'm hearing I'm hearing creeping too y'all what were you were you here the whole time watching this with me well we got mold up here it's not looking good actually this is the asthate's go it's looking a little bit um questionable okay so we need to do four to five I remember this bit but we didn't really get too much past this for 40 minutes grab some apples pop that in no in there there we go we ain't chopped him at all and we could barely throw it there we go so that's that done and it turns into a tape that's it in your neighborhood that says we got to this but then it got super weird and cut off it's funny I say cut off actually because I think that's what happens to woolly let's find out though I swear you weren't there before anyway let's see what happens in your neighborhood episode two hi friends and I'm woolly CBF why is your neighborhood [Music] um I like that there are so many friends in my neighborhood I want to send something special to my friend okay we haven't done this before we need to go to the store to buy them hold on hold on you know where the store is I do know where the store is but can we just talk about the the lines the dead body lines can we talk about those just one second Amanda you're staring almost at them Wooly's not looking he's like no it wasn't anything to do with me okay let's go to the store good job she scares me she genuinely scares me so I don't want to get it wrong let's pick out a card my friend helped me oh

your child she's a child from previous experience in the demos she just makes me uneasy all right I'm gonna abide by the rules okay yo woolly does not look happy by the way I hope she likes the cookies [Music] that wasn't a nice ending at all [Music] odds on that being like an acronym that's right I don't know the word actually okay that wasn't helpful at all was it that was creepy that was a moment in the bakery where things got super weird what do you think I didn't think you'd say anything okay tune [Music] well this is on the top of the piano nothing in there can we make other pies there's a code on here I kind of wish I'd paid more attention to the robot because it was like fifth oh wait 15. see if I remember 1535 wasn't it guess not okay okay let's have a look we've got the unknown Pokemon right here there's definitely there's something flitting around on my screen I don't like it hi Aunt Kate thank you so much for the roller skates dad and I went skating at the lake yesterday he fell down but don't tell him I told you that I can't wait to see you at summer vacation love Riley so we're Riley I guess Dear Mrs Park I know it's been a long time since you've seen me I swear the library was sometimes the only place I felt safe I always be grateful to you for that why can't I read for being someone I knew I could trust I need that again to trust two years ago my little brother Jordan disappeared poof gone my parents were never the same and now they're gone too they just didn't get over the grief it broke their hearts and eventually it killed them wow um nice the police figured someone snatched Jordan off the street that some crazy guy lured him away a freak occurrence you know a regular old suburban tragedy but I know there's something more to it and I know you know it too I thought I was alone nobody believed me when I tried bringing bringing it up but I heard about the kind of research you do the kind that normal people don't do I don't know maybe it's just a rumor but here I am he used to watch that show you know it was really sweet at first I remember that you even used to tell families with younger kids to watch it it was I don't know wholesome I guess and then it just got weird I'd find Jordan standing in front of the TV like he was in a trance and it was like that little girl was talking to him he said some really weird stuff it's like when you go onto the weird section of YouTube kids because that exists there's some anomalies on that YouTube kids app I knew most of the people around here don't believe in the kind of work you do not the library the other kind of work they just don't want to face the truth that something really evil was here can we meet and talk I don't know what to write here anymore I feel like someone is watching me sincerely Joanne cook okay so are we like a novice investigator or something I feel like the only lead we've got is the robot and it's definitely 15 wait let's cross it first 15

the hand isn't here do I have to do this whole thing again I've got an apple put the Apple in here no I don't know what you're looking at either you need to help me out here well I do have to do this over again okay I guess if that's what needs to be done that's what needs to be done okay chill out man all right I forgot to do this there we go is that what you wanted yes it was okay sweet okay open sesame 826 where's I get eight nine five from I need a test or something what was that boy I've just noticed as well this has the code for the plant pots on the code that was on there do you remember and we got this one back the code is eight two six eight two six see the safe has been replaced in this one that's what's going on okay let me just uh load this up and let's get to the bit where we're supposed to say no I guess let's see what happens I mean this is pretty dark man that was it this made me feel uneasy okay so this is where we say no see see everything is fine here don't eat me no don't kill me please don't kill me oh my God he's gonna kill me again oh Escape me again how I'm gonna go I want to go [Music] that is shape by the way I thought twice eight two six eight two six come on dummy dumb open the safe eight two six what's inside oh what's this was that like a pause button hmm let's put this down here for now we've got the other half of this code red orange blue beige potato lilac yellow purple pale pink ah what is the color for though oh wait there's a pot down here this has got a trident on it okay what does the trident mean pink oh that's the flower color maybe it's like a type of flower which type of flowers inside them let me put this pause button is that a pause it'll be a pause or an equals it looks like it's for him but also also kind of doesn't oh this needs batteries that's why he's not working okay that makes sense so we need batteries as well and do not get him wet I'm gonna try and do that straight away first bucket of water I get that's going all over you sir what if we try and unplug this definitely cannot be done hey there's a flower in your hair does that mean something is there yellow on here there is oh yo we dripping it's created flour is this something is there something to do with you I knew the flower thing was weird I can't see the notes now but this has grown a flower there's one that grew a potato which seemed really out of uh like super random this one's grown as well oh that's because we got it from the water yo this is weird Okay that's nice but that's blue okay still nothing weird with you what if I grow or if I give you this thank you but that's not my favorite flower oh sorry my bad okay um so I have oh this is the old one is this why one can I not see the old tapes again because I've kind of gone forward in the process and now we're on everything rots I feel like I need to go back to the beginning again um so this is the one which gives me five letters the only thing I can think is maybe I've just noticed there's a sticker up there the sticker was ripped off before but now it's actually the head of the thing that kills me that's weird I tried yes I tried no I've tried did I try maybe I think I did right maybe you answer my question let's see what happens if I just say like maybe over and over no [Music] my friend please oh it's saying I need to put oh that's weird it said something else it said something different okay so what do we have because we're always gonna get killed again we have the pause button I don't know what we need to do with the pause button that's a cool monster I like the monster look he's added the sticker those are ripped off before so there's maybe two other things that can kill me great hi hello Amanda and Woolly we are back I'm gonna look through the tapes if there's any more clues I was gonna do the I'm gonna do the safety favorite kind of pie my favorite kind of pie is there anything else I could see here but hey I didn't get to type it Amanda today we're gonna put potatoes a knife good job oh we can use a sharp knife pause button okay so there's something we can use the button for has this changed oh no the safe is still there right pause button you can use the pause button on this it definitely had pause on it though yeah let's set it to five yeah five seven five seems to be the hottest what if I just put can I put the button in here no that didn't work it was like a pause with the Flames so I need to set something on fire oh my dumb wait a second I was here the whole time was on the TV how did I not think that oh my God right okay let's see if we can do anything different with this yeah we got a pause button now unbelievable so uh Pate wouldn't let me type never mind okay so I'm gonna pause it when the thing comes up knife I don't like the way you look at me with that knife okay so this says to put the heat up really high so I'm gonna do that quickly I was kind of on the right track but the pause really threw me off let's put this really high and then come oh it's changes change has changed we said we sell fire wait oh my God yo my bad my bad was I supposed to oh wait oh it's changed there's cheese here uh potato mushroom and meat reheat the oven to 525 in a pie tin mix meat potato and mushroom bake for 50 minutes and enjoy cheese so cheese is gonna be I thought it's gonna be ingredient but there's a mouse trap over here so let's bung this on yo I'm getting you Mouse I looked away for two seconds you're going into the pie that's right it didn't specify the meat oh God that's grim little mouse in there I didn't look at the mouse I was trying to bad mouth it I was like yeah come here didn't work it died I didn't get to see it be killed that's slightly strange right mushrooms are over here for sure let's grab one of those this is gonna be a freaky pie I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to use these kind of mushrooms in cooking but looks kind of crazy and then we need potato so now that we've got this going on we need the moon see it's all making sense now where's the Moon that ain't a moon no no no moon okay let's go over here grow this this should give us a spud we can pick the Spud and then we're good to go right grow my pretty yeah show me oh look at that maybe I just put this in like this let's see what happens that is that is a scuffed pie okay uh preet ovens five to five there we go uh 50 mins no creaking please don't even come out through there I've worked hard for this 50 mins let's get cooking that's right that ain't a meat pie in your neighborhood oh wait

fine so we need the one with like a weird marking on it it's the yellow one oh she has it in her hair already though yeah that's the yellow one there and it's already in her hair so maybe just double yellows wait didn't we do the yellow one already or was that in a previous go through oh wait there's a red padlock guts red padlock guts red padlock guts is that which one's the red padlock is it this one yeah what's gonna be in here oh my oh What's it gonna be yeah crayon cutter oh another tape and oh you want me to snip you want me to snip her dude that's dark I'm gonna put these right here so now we know that if we die we can go back to the beginning where the doll is yeah yeah here we go what's a family oh my God this is creepy man just where you got Amanda hello can you make a sound like a sheep that's great yo he looks shocked he sounds just like Willie oh severe thunderstorm it can buy him for any potential there are a lot of animals here [Music] spend time with animals they are very different from people true look different and they don't talk like people this is getting bored Amanda [Music] of them talk silly oh it looks so defeated he's angry actually wow are you ready oh ready [Music] also jump scared by a pig I don't believe it jump scared by a pig yeah animals have family let's go see one of the animal family I want to see the chicken can you show me where the chickens are oh just this way why do you look so worried oh what is wrong with that bomb it's eyes he needs to go to sleep or something [Music] hey hen and a is it cockroach how do you spell that is that what Daddy chicken is called [Music] rooster I'm dumb tornado warning oh God wait tornado and a thunderstorm at the same time uh rooster I don't know [Music] that's not what happens Amanda now Bond looks ready to blow look at him what is he doing [Music] what's this what's that spiders scary is that a snake are you okay Bond are you right oh no he's saying no he's saying no why only sheep is his family oh no what have we done oh it's wooly blizzard as well okay things are getting pretty outrageous over here oh hi a little kitten where is your family it looks like this kitten is what are you gonna do to the cat man how do you think she feels uh scare scoff why is I type scarf she feels upset oh I didn't type that I swear I didn't type that I was typing upset I will take it away from you yes sir wait that was something in the background I missed it [Music] I'm looking I've got all eyes I'm all eyes like the barn Amanda Amanda Amanda what is this oh it's a weather machine oh that's the thing from the box uh where's the Box you came from just want to check it real quick nothing inside huh I'm hearing Rumblings lots of Rumblings okay let's just press let's see what happens what are we gonna get Thunder nothing happened keep spinning The Wheel of Fortune I'll get this one at the top we want this what are you broke are you busted oh man okay so maybe we need to do a pause when it comes up I think that's what it's gonna be isn't it when that comes up we need to pause it okay oh pause pause it's on thunderstorm already I mean let's see what happens storm goes I wonder what's he doing now what's he doing now oh okay this is good that we did this yeah lizards yeah why is have I missed one let's see what happens where's tornado lost yeah I need the tornado one wait what have I missed it I missed it how hey there we go okay so I needed to get it wrong I think I just replicate what I did before last time when I went through it I said the right answer straight away now it's gonna be the top one there we go this should come up straight away because we saw all three at the beginning yep there it is what is gonna happen to me though let's find out what's that because this one's scratched out I'm about to die yo nothing to say nothing to it nothing to say is it wrong what else could I pause it on it's all scratched at the top as well where's that spider webs oh wait there's something behind it that looks like a blizzard to me but maybe I'm cutting these cobwebs up snip snip there's definitely something behind it it looks like a blizzard but maybe I need to get rid of the cobwebs first I just I don't know how I'm gonna do that I could no what can I do to get rid of it because I don't want to watch the whole thing again how do I get rid of that the only thing I haven't tried is any wrong answers uh specifically the cat at the end so let me skip all the way to chickens rooster and sheep [Music] she's a cat so you say alone but then I immediately said yes because I'm a kind person no no no more again oh my god what have I done what is happening to the sheep's head the um that I'm dead I'm dead I've awakened the beast I'm sorry oh the the doll is back though there she is all mad and stuff I might get my second sticker though give me a sticker oh I kind of expected to die I think we need a sticker wait if you're gonna kill me like that you'll give me the sticker I think what we need to do is use the scissors hello didn't give me one so we need to go and open the red chest with the word guts and then it will work from there I think so here's guts and then we grab whatever is in here so it's this and I got a snip snip snip I am so sorry yo you didn't need to scream a little bats let's go some batteries and stick these in here no let's put these in here let's go hey blabber yeah yeah it's gonna be great 50 50 oh 3 26. okay one one five zero three I don't know oh that was it on a tape where did I find that am I supposed to know a number for that I grab your head oh I can grab your head uh have this what do I do with the head I think I was gonna do the flower first no because the flowers changing her hair and I need a yellow one let me see what happens if I throw this and see if it changes a color no because she's dead now fantastic okay might have messed this up I mean it also says not to get him wet right if I open this that's got to be a clue as well oh over there I can pick up this water here oh God I'm so sorry that I just cut your head off I feel awful I'm gonna try getting more things wrong oh that was weird your Wooly's face okay I'm gonna try and get more of these wrong and see what happens let's do rooster what's the next choice this one let's go see some snakes I don't want to go near oh flooding warning oh I need to do this one again man I need to do this whole bit again blabu don't get it wet this is dual making sense to me now all right we got the machine let's get these working okay thunderstorm warning is here so that's the first one we need to do oh kind of terrifying right next one next one's with the rooster so I think we can skip this bit do this wrong sir do that we've got a tornado up next which still doesn't make sense oh there's waves no way we go tornado time this one he does there we've got a flooding warning is this actually gonna do something that I'm kind of scared let's let's see I am worried oh that was a spider I knew it oh wait this is everything rots again this is the only one that has like a yellowy green kind of label to it it's weird it's creepy I don't like it there we go done that one and now we pop this one in and see what happens hello oh God it's Amanda he's making that bad smell okay uh I want to see if there's anything else I think it's this big stinks oh yeah this is the weird one it's dead we know the answer to this [Music] good job [Music] oh this one's alive it looks like this kid oh please please oh my God yes I can't look look at woolly wooly is so terrified this has happened to him before yes am I about to be disturbed oh God it's making me uneasy what do I do why is it is there anything I can do here don't do it Amanda please oh do I need to click something oh I do I click the cat it swallowed my tape what is uh oh oh [Music] oh did you here comes I want the meat one I was sick wait are these were endings I think we got a secret ending waxing you know oh that's cool okay so who was who was on The Chopping Block there was that me was that woolly was that the cat am I gonna have to say no because we still got to try and get the robot wet we still need to do something with the doll as well look for her yellow flower oh we still need to open this as well green there's still quite a few things to do but I don't feel like that ending was a good one we escaped down the hatchet and got turned into food oh and there's this as well we haven't unlocked this man there is so much to do still right let's start with what we do know we know so this Peach is suspicious I don't know what to do with it though so what we do know is a code for this doesn't quite work not to get it wet either I think it's a weird clue that we need to do the flower here but we need to find the right plant pot is there a plant pot in the save if I can remember it's a eight two six there's something in here right what was it right there was a plan put in something oh yeah that's empty right have you got your batteries in you do I feel like you're the closest thing we have 1503 25. the code was in one of these wonder if it means because we've got the pause button uh uh lamb 's delicious oh I was just messing around Lamy I'm sorry I was just messing around I swear oh it's not let me skip now what have I done cut the apples yo did I mess up what did I do okay I hope I just didn't get you killed buddy guys we need this and then we can do we need the next tape so we need to do whatever this is what is it um there we go I remember there was it 14425 right in your neighborhood I feel like it's in the shop in here isn't it let's pick out so that's where it is 1503.25 let's see if this works [Music] oh so my condolences to Kate oh now it's gone fuzzed up on K on Kate are you in the room are you here what is going on I'm so I actually feel bad yo what the this looks stunning oh my God congratulations you're one year older wishing you the bestest year yet oh eight one eight two one is that right numbers again I'm gonna take this with me there was something we haven't unlocked yet oh wait oh wait 1821 08 18 21. [Music] three two five thirty oh what this B25 30. [Music] oh my God what is happening oh what is happening what's going on candle may your year be filled with blessings love from blabber a blabber respect man thank you five times minus one is four one times one plus two is two so four four two what is one divided by one one or zero I don't know so it's four four two something three zero I need to write this down this game has got me tripping one times four two I think one divided by one is one my basic math skills are awful [Music] what's in the card is on the cake blabbit you're being weird right now buddy wait did I do one or zero let's do this again um [Music] zero three zero okay it's not that so we know that one divided by one is one I'm learning things today what's on the cake is in the card is it two then what's on the cake is in the card I can't do anything with the cake though there's candles what's on the card is in the cake my initial thought was to change all the candle icons to two and I didn't try that so let's let's try it uh two times four is eight five take two is three two times two plus one two times two is four plus one so five and then I think it's there's still one two four six one [Music] ccdcfe c c d c f e c c d c f e c happy birthday okay so you're three you're not two at all pop s yo be quiet oh it's the special version of the accidents one oh God that's one of the creepiest ones give me oh it's actually giving me another vacation as well oh my God it's always scary when the old achievements come up okay that was right see I had it right this whole time I didn't even try it I tried I swear I said that at the beginning we're still missing two stickers right now oh God trust me yes uh yes sir I didn't get time Amanda an accident when a friend has an accident sometimes nobody can help them but we can try hello Amanda I'm fine I I just uh well our Lily is so confused I feel so good about this I really have to help him first we have to know what part of I mean maybe his thought isn't

man because that's not another tape is it hey did I survive oh I'm out there somewhere it's creepy though the end is that good ending good ending good ending all right we still have more to look at though because we've got extra codes which I think is going to go into the robot bro that was uh that was an adventure okay oh yeah we got the song sticker there's still one sticker missing which I'm guessing is to do with the code we got in that creepy tape however I don't know if we will now have yeah it's locked again it's reset the beginning oh I Blame You and where's your yellow flower I need it but guys you know what I feel like I'm gonna end this here however if you guys want to see another video following up doing the secret endings I'm really intrigued to see if there's other ones I'm pretty sure there is because there's hidden steam achievements which usually means hidden endings but hey let me know if you want to see that then leave a like that'd be awesome the more likes this gets the more likely I am to do it I really want to though because this is an interesting game nothing like I played before so thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed if you did leave a like

obstacle course while dodging the sabotager who's gonna win I think it's gonna be me you're gonna have to watch till the end to find out jellystore.com face to face with traffic face them face with wait what wait no it says wait who's there at the back of the traffic wait it's a sabotage here in the traffic Jenny go go far oh there he is all right so I don't know where it starts but it's gonna start soon somewhere Josh why are we going round around what I don't know oh my God I see it wait do you see that Josh wait where do we go I don't know help me get out of the way I'm confused oh yeah you guys are probably going the right direction try that yeah keep that up you are something special Josh wow such a little liar how how guys stop it what is this map are you still gonna help me make it up there I think clearly we're supposed to do it as a jump okay it's not rocket science all right [Music] I feel like cars aren't built for this you've never clearly never driven a car before clearly oh my God what is this I can't believe the sabotage what is this is this is the most oh let's go I think it's about to start here Josh oh wow all right now I just got to make sure you fall off before you get that checkpoint you're not gonna get it you realize that we have a dedicated wait it does it literally starts here you haven't even made the checkpoint yet ah can you stop I should I just keep going could you stop should I just keep going it's not much face to face when you're not here maybe you can face to face someone else how about you make it yeah I did why is it nearly why is the sun going down who set this up huh uh the sabotager did and he's trying to where is this why am I in first I was behind I was waiting for you man I thought you were gonna struggle for like 10 minutes you were waiting for me okay here we go yeah I was back on that Merry-Go-Round are we one ticket please oh my goodness what did you just say I was waiting for you Josh you were really having a hard time with that and so was the sabotager which clearly means the temperature is absolutely worse well it looks like I've got a big Angry truck coming up so um no you better start your apologies all right come and get me then mate well you're about to feel many things in your body looks like I know you might be in first but it ain't gonna last Josh it ain't gonna last it's a sabotager ever going to get here like I know right I don't think the sabotager understands his job sabotage or be struggling sabotage is literally about to get pushed off the map by me wait but bye-bye no no no no no no no no no no no no no no that's an unfortunate scenario for you oh oh but what's unfortunate for you is that there's two wedge trucks on its way to slaughter no but I see I have what you don't which is skill where's the sabotager it's the sabotager okay can I just go around oh my God I hate these stop signs I'm gonna go left these side signs are the absolute worst there are 36 checkpoints I'm not doing 36 checkpoints of this mess it's all for good fun I'm not having fun are you having fun I I mean it depends depends on my it depends if I make this because uh sabotage is kind of camping all right I think I just helped you there okay sabotage is up ahead he looks like he's doing some level of acrobatics come on I shouldn't laugh too early there's a barrier here oh no oh my God the barrier stopped him thank you barrier all right look who just caught up what have you switched into then a ramp car yep oh you are so lucky Josh you are so lucky he's cool at luck but come on let's be honest no it's luck sorry okay hit me yes Craig Oh what now I've got a a rather large truck that I what's gonna happen with it yeah that's usually what happens this is terrible Josh we're doing 36 checkpoints of this gonna take half an hour yeah but I have a feeling it's not gonna be back and forth the entire time sabotage is actually behind me and I don't think I'm gonna make this sabotage her in the wedger I feel like having a sabotager in this was a little Overkill sabotaging can we maybe switch to like a wedger maybe could we like like a a ramp car maybe something what does it get now you know he's got the pointy car that's the wedger drop yeah I said the ramp car I meant to say the ramp car okay just oh my God I dodged it I don't know how he's on his way to the switcher Rooney to be fair the ramp call would make this a bit more interesting I agree all right jelly I am on my way yeah this vehicle's a bit long for what yeah I know this is terrible the Turning angle is terrible hey can't wait there's not enough room to wait are you dead you're gonna have to do it oh I'm actually fine you're actually fine I don't know how it looked like the missiles like temporarily disconnected uh but hey we're good hey let's go oh my God stop you know I hate that this thing is like depends on who's like client like no I agree I agree yeah yeah yeah it might be different from mine ah it's our glued vehicle yeah these are glued to the road Josh oh seriously and we're off your wheels are a little bit off the front nose is replacing eight laps minimum me all right there we go I am changing into an aqua vehicle what's this gonna be no not this thing does that mean that we can go are we gonna go into the water I hope so continuing I enjoy water I like swimming do you like swimming sometimes I pretend I'm a fish I do that in the bathtub what Josh um I did that so racing Vehicles sabotage oh my God which is going to be not ideal Josh I'm not sure these water cars can fly like they can get a water and they can drive but did he go into the water I don't know maybe you should know that the ramp card doesn't swim we're gonna talk to him again confused them I dodged them again such a pro in this as well of all things yeah right are you gonna be able to Dodge I definitely didn't dodge him but luckily this thing is pretty heavy oh no that's that's probably yourself knew you're gonna say that jelly all right and um I've got the rocket card next I'm gonna try to take the ramp you let me is it not gonna slow you down but yeah but I gotta Rock like speed it up right right so that's all right so I will be in the rocket vehicle next actually you know what I could do I'm gonna get the sabotage oh my God that worked really well sabotage or ramp me I'm gonna fly to the end okay it's gonna be oh my god do you respawn ready let's go let's go dude what a Pro Gamer move that was that was such a Pro Gamer move Josh you need to take the ramp car and you make it halfway you skip all these I did not make it very well oh I guess you're not a Pro Gamer oh we'll find out who the real Pro Gamer is because I've got the longest vehicle in the game and I'm not sure I'm gonna make it through those wedger things okay apparently uh I'm getting ramped again okay take the rap myself this time oh my okay you can do it go away sabotage you you're useless we already knew that didn't we go somewhere else sabotager doesn't have any friends are we being too rude to Mr Savo I think we're being a little bit too we're too rude to the person that is dedicated to us why did I fall through the one hole oh my God seriously versus The Buzz is not exactly a great combination just leave me alone that's good I need speed for this too far we're going too far oh my God [Music] oh I got it I got it I absolutely lost so much time from that and it was a complete what did you do I can't believe I made it through this with the bus the bus is really difficult oh my God oh my God the ramp girl hit me really bad who decided it was a good idea to drive a bus on this map I know that's what I've been complaining about I got a little bit of work to do to catch I think yeah yeah and I just made it to the end with the bus so I'm gonna get something a little bit easier we're almost halfway by the way five more checkpoints well I just oh oh I go from the biggest vehicle in the game to the smallest what are you in a go-kart a go-kart yep Josh who's gonna win if I like go-kart versus bus like if I hit you what do you think will happen are you actually asking me what do you think will happen what do I think will happen go-kart vs bus yeah do you want to say that again but slower it wasn't an issue you literally just drove over me like I was a piece of paper I didn't say it was gonna be an issue but I don't think you were gonna make an issue for me either oh my God Ram cars by me oh this thing's very agile I like it the gold card's actually pretty decent but the sabotager is really trying his best to hit me but I'm not letting him last stop for bus uh slow go actually it says Downtown is the last stop Josh so you're kind of inaccurate that's my my um that's my stage oh you thought you thought the bus wasn't was bad we got this missile thing again Josh well I'm in this go-kart this isn't even this is like smaller than like a standard go-kart this is like um to know you know like the go-karts have the barriers on them this one's oh yeah this is the bear go-kart listen I'm just I'm not trying to give the sabotager any ideas but if he gets a bus he can just block us it sounds like you're trying to give this Avatar ideas no I'm not landed if he gets the bus we wouldn't be in such such a big issue I think the missile I think the missile thing would be just as good yeah sabotage you're clearly not doing much so maybe switch up on your vehicle Choice oh my God I didn't die jeez yeah well when you get crushed by things yeah I know I flew off the map and then actually kind of landed it somehow don't worry about it Josh I'm not particularly enjoying driving this missile truck I'm just saying I'm surprised she caught up like uh like you did though I thought you would struggle more with the bus yeah I mean I did get absolutely crushed in it but it worked out okay rev course see you later no I'm not even gonna try that I'm in a ram car you're not gonna enjoy it the missile thing just like does not get affected by the ramp card really I thought like barely I thought I could try to hit you up you could try he would try although this is probably yeah see just like a little hot it's just a little hard to jump I mean it doesn't even make sense that it hops even like I think it's probably like 20 000 tons yeah 21 with you driving them all right did you respawn oh he got rid of the round blocking the pack he said what is he in the idea would you hear us and so Josh how I don't know should we be worried about that he hacked us all right he's literally doing what I said I don't want him to do okay well what are you with now what's the level this is called the Pantone uh okay okay so now you are gonna enjoy my ramp card oh no wait no you know the Fiat what's it called uh small car that will do all right you ready to fly nah nah I'm in the water well that works for me yeah see that means you caught up just like that all right go for another fly jelly all right big one okay I'll land this look at you guys I didn't land it I do everything P jelly I help you and make you go fly fly you're changing um so yeah it looks like we're getting blocked up here just you I could actually just fit like I could when he slammed against the wall I can still think he doesn't have enough right yeah yeah and now we got the auction someone should get him a torch what he said he hasn't got a torch no he doesn't have enough torque I think it's bright enough outside I don't think it's a problem come on let's go jelly oh I hit the sign oh that's nice all right well where we're at in the race right now it's starting to get quite important to pry and make up some time well the sabotager is nine minutes behind so yeah but I don't think this Avatar is too worried about their position that's true he's dnf'd every single time he played with him I mean I realized that yeah because his one goal is to make us sad leave me alone sadness he feeds off leave me alone why don't I have a red one doing great jelly oh whoa oh he's going around he's trying to trick you yes [Music] all right we are past the halfway mark this is the longest race I've ever done in my life Josh this is one hell of a head-to-head right here does this work like a ram car you think what what do you mean like if we hit him I don't think so okay don't drop speed at all come on Full Speed Ahead full speed full speed so I think are we cycling through different vehicles I think we are right so that's what I guess is this your stuff first time you realize that we can start predicting what we're gonna get soon I think [Music] 16 inch how is that gonna help anyone very lucky I might be Josh to answer your question that helps me because now I'm in first thank you for answering my question I was very curious how bad is this against the the missile trouble he missed me he's too slow and I think yeah I think we're kind of a thing I'm going to be driving literally into all right I'm already I'm already halfway man let's go let's go this ain't too bad what was the next vehicle for the sabotage or after the big military truck I don't even I don't I think there may be something and then the aqua machine oh I nearly got and you got aqua tank I don't know man what do you call that who made it to the end yeah almost I just did it's like an APC isn't it or is that something else uh that's a good question right later okay so good to know that I'm gonna get a rocket car next there's no like place to do a jump like from this side yeah no there's not unless I make a jump card he's he's got the Formula One car it was after the formula I can't keep up Jenny I can't either oh well rocket car because we just got the rocket no we just had the wedger no we had to oh wait he's gonna get one okay well that's going to be a bit problematic for us he gets the wedger we're we're done not the wedge of what is it a wedger no yeah is that the actual I've got the I have a I have a go-karting I don't know I think it's called The Wedge truck the wedge truck well we're definitely getting through the checkpoints quite quick I mean we're closing in towards the end now the sabotage is gonna have to find something decent to stop us and this will better not go up yeah it did that for me and it takes forever this is probably the most annoying thing in head-to-head yeah balls that just randomly go up they yep they hurt my feelings more than anything more than me oh God he's got he's got that water tank but he's got nothing against us nothing you can't stop the go-kart you simply can't you definitely can do no you can't because I think you definitely can all right try me then try driving to the Sea and see how long you last all right what do we get then what's the upgrade from the okay bus time so the bus is the thing that can I think can truly what's your goal here asking it you are you know we're dealing with a sabotage someone that their entire goal is just to Simply ruin our day and you're going you know what I'm also going to do that to Josh like that is cross my mind oh my God I just saw I just saw a flying rocket car land in the city very distracting when I'm trying to make a point in this is a car flying into the sea oh you saw that too that's good okay so we know now that the sabotage is not that far away from getting a um dude we're bullying the Sabbath actually at this point yeah maybe he should never have switched away from a ramp call that was maybe his biggest mistake he's probably just trying to figure out how to get back you literally could take the ramp ramp car I mean rocket car oh talking about Ram cars hey uh if you could not ramp me that would be I mean I'm driving really slow so oh I might have helped you there did I help you no you died no you just didn't help me oh stop don't claim because I thought I thought maybe I sent you over that barrier that would be fine I'm telling you these vehicles there's definitely like a random element to it otherwise I think that the sabotager definitely would have had something more aggressive I agree I mean maybe he does have something I don't know have you seen him recently he's got the bus you know everyone will always asks dude you gotta ramp anyone else he's trying to block the ramp car he doesn't understand what Ram cars do does he safely does it hello Jelly hey Josh how's life I see the sabotage is chilling oh he's in the bus alert the bus has entered the chat uh it's not typing no so we got to figure out where oh my God I'm doing really well right I just watch the sabotage you just get completely crushed it might be going well for them all right I'm gonna checkpoint 26 we have 10 more checkpoints to go Josh what is the next vehicle jelly what's the next vehicle rocket car I'm gonna do the same thing I did before and let's use the Ram oh all right good luck with that you know you could just reverse jelly and they won't come on that'll help all right land it land it land it yes okay I'm such a pro nobody Landed It But Me nobody Landed It But Me let's go didn't even fail man didn't even fail how good am I okay oh Josh Josh oh no there's a different type of checkpoint up ahead I am letting you know there's a different type of checkpoint up ahead I don't know what that means but I'll let you know I flew off the map so that's what I why Josh I am just about to get a different type of checkpoint what does this mean for me please I'm not in a hole please yes my God Josh wait what's happening I think you might be in trouble I am switching between a lot of vehicles wait I'm at checkpoint there was a gap there I am a checkpoint 32 oh oh Josh serious Josh I'll let you get here come on then come on men Josh come on then I'm about to I'm about to end this well that depends if there's a sabotage that's gonna try and end my day I mean he's trying to end my day really but wait what is he doing he's hitting me with the bus but I mean he's a bus oh it's kind of his fault for being in a bus all right I've just saw in the lap jelly I'll be there soon all right all right I should have to go back and forth a couple of times good luck you're gonna dnf actually you can't lost don't catching off dnf in second place yeah that's too bad Josh look at this pathetic little sabotage you're in a little it's a little gold card I don't even think he is that's it Josh let's go end it with a bang but you got second place you lost thanks for watching click and watch another video do it now"

the hardest building to take back in this game and Casey is just in the godspot candy snakes if I'm if I'm if I'm looking at live Vegas odds right now I'm throwing a million dollars on Casey bro Casey wants me to coach him Casey it's very simple you don't leave this building you win is it boring yes effective to get this W yes Crimson is two percent okay so Crimson is two percent so that means Diamond one has got to be like top ten percent right gotta be I've coached people before all right it's seven percent okay two percent of players in the world if you really think about it that way he's a ranked player right so he's top seven percent in ranked let's see if he can secure a war zone win shall we I mean like I said hey this is boring bro but it's effective about having the rpk out although I'm pretty sure those pistols are ass so that literally might be oh my God Casey there's no way you're losing this bro there's no way no one can kill you up here as long as you're not a bot and your top seven percent it's pretty crazy to think that he's top seven percent in ranked play and he has two kills in Warzone never expandable Mega wolf yeah Casey just keep snaking bro we got this man we're gonna win this whoa whoa whoa where'd that come from make it on your left okay I don't want to distract you you did he's right there he saw his gun through the wall that was a good win Casey you're a literal [\u00a0__\u00a0] bullet though do you see his health bottom left someone else coming in that was the door I don't think I have to tell you that nuke skin here we go how did he get another plane on that fast who's hey you're taught your top seven percent in the world bro I remember that [\u00a0__\u00a0] foreign oh God this is kind of a gamble playing this wall is probably a good call but someone could technically hop above him is he gonna be able to bring this home for the ranked players or is Warzone gonna win find out next time on Dragon Ball Z I love this rotation with those shots I don't know about this Precision I would have saved it for the rotation that's just me personally 1v1v1 you know one's kind of near the tower I wish we saved the Precision Tower guy we have a gold gas mask how's it going to play it this is good this is good actually are we putting that on Casey it was a great rotation he just honest to God the reason he loses that is the reload glitch it's more of a game mechanic right Call of Duty reload though if I've ever seen one but I I probably wouldn't I you know you know what I I don't know if we put that on Casey man that was a good that was a good run that was a good run for Casey very well I mean top seven percent player in the world technically right if he's Diamond one top seven percent in ranked play but listen to a t-tv in Warzone so you know it is what it is"

of course I've got to be Darth Maul it is time to become one with the force oh my God there's so many players everywhere oh my gosh everyone's over here oh got myself a rifle [Music] hello mannequin goodbye and again [Music] oh my gosh there's so many people and look at this yes perfect Anakin Skywalker Force pull and force jump yes please we are learning our first responsibilities whilst taking people down I never thought I'd be playing fortnite as Darth Maul with an Ali-A back bling learning new abilities we can now double jump an awesome Force pull as well of course lightsabers are back in the game look at these things and not pickaxes still probably never will be despite how much we always ask for them and yes new abilities like being able to double jump Force pull Force push all of these are now available there's also a new rifle this is the dc-15 Blaster rifle and I mean honestly this one kind of destroyed everyone that came up against me just there whoa whoa you just not take full damage yeah so if you have a lightsaber you can't double jump unless you're using the lightsaber even if you zoom in let's say I just use my forces on this whoa destroy objects oh my gosh I have got to try and hit someone with these new abilities now obviously I got pretty damn lucky at the start of this game to get one of the Star Wars characters literally spawning in front of me but throughout the game you'll see them on your map spawning in and you've got to be the first one to go up to them to get the lightsaber to get the abilities so it is definitely a bit of a rush but oh my gosh when you've got it dude it is so worth it oh everyone's trying to take me down but no way Darth Vader is not going down that easily happens if I use the force on a chicken let's have a look chicken I just drew it in oh my gosh oh we've got some enemies over here if we can do anything with it come here oh my dude I use the Ability so well on him as well are you kidding me okay so the force pull ability may not have gone too well but I've now got the force push ability okay you that's got to be a joke NPC come join me because you're one of a Star Wars quests to get hired let's try this again whoa whoa oh my God the miles away as well but guess if you're in a tricky situation and you want to send the enemy away properly eat them with this one there's also rumors the Bush Warrior forecast and first assault augments may be back in the game again we know that this season's augments have been awful so I really hope that this is true if not they've at least been added back into the files again which is great news we need better augments this season I want to find someone I can just absolutely ye off of like a building here in mega City what happens if I just push this guy off oh my gosh he's fuming at me God bro his ability is sick I do that from here okay no I think he was a little bit better than mine mate he's launching rocks at me oh hello there ignore the fact that did kind of nothing to him but be there for a second mate whoa everybody's pushing back into the storm there's people everywhere I gotta get out of here all of these force abilities are driving people crazy year later I'm on the hunt the third and final force ability that I've yet to use we've used Push Pull we've not used throw yet and honestly the story sounds like the best one of all of them I'm so excited to get this one and of course it's gonna be learned from Darth Maul who else gonna be learned by I'm keeping an eye on the mini map we've got to look for a red MPC drop come on I found it I found it the Sith Apprentice lightsaber wait if you just pick up the lightsaber you don't get the ability ah so you actually have to be the one to learn it wow there I was thinking I'd taken down the person that had done it and I'd get it myself but you don't whichever portal or riftgate you go into to learn the different Star Wars forces are the forces that you're locked into for the rest of the game so you may not want to rush straight into it if you see a green icon on the map that is Obi-Wan's Force push if you see a red icon it's Darth Maul's Force bro which is the one we're still trying to get of course the blue one is Anakin's horse oh there we go there is one on the map gotta rush over though because everyone else is going for it hopefully we can get there quick enough it's not too far there it is there it is there it is yes Darth Maul teach me horse throwing Force jump yes yes yes yes yes yes I've already got the lightsabers can be the ability oh my gosh let's go oh I didn't need the second lightsaber so I'll leave that to someone else because I'm a nice guy that now means we can super super we can super jump and we can oh throw that has to be the best one guys let's not Overlook the fact that the rift gates are back in the game we've not seen riftgates today bringing Hunters into the game back in what chapter two leakers have also found a rift gate that has an image which includes an outline a very brief glimpse of the chapter one map we don't know much more about this Rift gate than that with today's update being such a major one it has been tons of files and information regarding what's becoming next season which is getting closer and closer and I'm gonna be gapping all of that information for a big video coming soon we have got four new augments that can potentially spawn in we've got tracker's Armory which will give you the flare gun and Shadow tracker really good we got desperate reload where pistols will reload faster when the clip is fully emptied steady hands with a marksman rifles have reduced recoil I think they're trying to make their marksman rifles more usable an SMG sign up for the last three bullets of your SMG will deal even more damage I think by far my favorite thing of these updates is just the mini battle pass the three Cosmetics the awesome Cosmetics what the hell you guys see that fortnite's slightly bugging out there I'd love to know out of all the mini battle passes and big collaborations that we've had recently Dragon Ball my hero Academia of course now Star Wars what do you rate this one I've gotta definitely rate this one up there with the rift portals returning the new Star Wars abilities the lightsabers I think this is the best Star Wars collab in fortnite we've had and we've had lots of them of course but this one's just been done so well to ignore the fact that every time I've used one of the abilities it has got me killed I actually think these abilities will be a lot better in build mode but you can destroy builds and do a lot more with it I mean look like it's just so fun destroying stuff I'm just seeing all these incredible Star Wars skins in-game is awesome and guess what I returned to build mode for the first time in one year see how I get on and if I can get a win click on screen here this Star Wars update is awesome I hope you've enjoyed see you on another video"

      "corpus": "Honestly, I don't even know where to start. On\u00a0 the surface you\u2019ve got this perfectly normal\u00a0\u00a0 family. Young girl, grandmother. You know,\u00a0 apple pie America kind of stuff. But I knew\u00a0\u00a0 better. I'd seen this kind of innocence\u00a0 too many times. So I did what I do best,\u00a0\u00a0 I dug deeper. But apparently in the\u00a0 process, I struck a nerve. Because\u00a0\u00a0 that's when this showed up on my doorstep. And\u00a0 that was the moment when everything changed. Hello Internet! Welcome to Game Theory and\u00a0 the first ever four way Theorist crossover\u00a0\u00a0 weekend. I've been looking forward to this day\u00a0 ever since we launched Style Theory. Now we've\u00a0\u00a0 done this kind of thing before. KFC Week, Pokemon\u00a0 Week and our most infamous cross channel event:\u00a0\u00a0 Cannibalism Week. A theme so nice we\u00a0 actually decided to do it twice. But today,\u00a0\u00a0 ladies and gentlemen, we're doing you one better. Welcome, my friends, to Mystery Meat Weekend. Yep,\u00a0\u00a0 it sounds gross. And believe me, kinda is. Over\u00a0 on Film Theory we're dissecting the living meat\u00a0\u00a0 monsters of Vita Carnis. Food Theory is carving\u00a0 into some meatballs made out of cloned mammoth\u00a0\u00a0 meat, and Style Theory is being the most sensible\u00a0 of the bunch by looking into how many people you\u00a0\u00a0 can feed using a dress made of pure beef. So go get yourself a heaping helping of\u00a0\u00a0 protein by checking those out after you've\u00a0 finished over here. It is a weekend full of\u00a0\u00a0 content that would make the Liver King proud. Not\u00a0 that that's anything I am actively striving for. How then are we celebrating Mystery\u00a0 Meat Weekend here on Game Theory? Well,\u00a0\u00a0 what I've got cooking for you is\u00a0 fresh, juicy and hot out of the oven.\u00a0 We're heading back to the world of Merge Mansion\u00a0 to take another look at the mysterious pies cooked\u00a0\u00a0 by the one and only Grandma Ursula. If you're\u00a0 not sure what I'm talking about, let me catch\u00a0\u00a0 you up. Over a year ago, we started looking into\u00a0 the mystery of Merge Mansion, an item matching\u00a0\u00a0 mobile game that caught everyone's attention\u00a0 with their series of bizarrely dramatic ads. Houses set on fire, hidden basements\u00a0 full of money, sheds full of knives.\u00a0 And of course, your sweet loving\u00a0 grandma arrested with one of three\u00a0\u00a0 mysterious quotes written on her\u00a0 hand as she's driven away by the\u00a0\u00a0 paddy wagon. Some of these things even got\u00a0 freaking Kathy Bates to star as Grandma.\u00a0 Grandma! When you get an Oscar\u00a0\u00a0 winning actress to start giving titty twisters\u00a0 to statues in order to hawk your mobile game,\u00a0\u00a0 you know you've got cash to spare. Anyway, using those ads, I was able to\u00a0\u00a0 put together a timeline of events and answer the\u00a0 question that smeared across all of them. What\u00a0\u00a0 is Grandma hiding? The answer, if you've been\u00a0 watching this channel long enough, was obvious:\u00a0\u00a0 Murder! I suspected that Grandma Ursula\u00a0 was involved in an elaborate murder plot,\u00a0\u00a0 killing people off and then hiding the dead\u00a0 bodies in her famous pies, Sweeney Todd style.\u00a0 She was then training up her granddaughter Maddie,\u00a0 to take over the family business and her iconic\u00a0\u00a0 secret recipe. Hence why we're here today for\u00a0 Mystery Meat Weekend. And that's honestly where\u00a0\u00a0 I left my investigation. Merge Mansion went back\u00a0 to releasing their normal CG ads, which didn't\u00a0\u00a0 really add anything to the lore. And I went back\u00a0 to doing what I do best, failing to solve FNAF.\u00a0 But little did I suspect what the\u00a0 developers of this game had cooking. A challenge; an invite to the mansion\u00a0 to get hands on and search for clues to\u00a0\u00a0 put the Grandma Ursula mystery to rest.\u00a0 But before I entered the garden gates,\u00a0\u00a0 they also sent through plenty\u00a0 of pre reading materials. And there, buried in all that paperwork was\u00a0 where I'd find the most shocking reveal to date. That's right. Grandma was a unit! Osteoporosis aint got nothing on those bones. But apparently I wasn't the only detective\u00a0 headed there that afternoon. Pedro Pascal,\u00a0\u00a0 fresh off the heels of the last of us,\u00a0 would also be there at the mansion as\u00a0\u00a0 part of this mystery event. In fact,\u00a0 he had just been tapped to play the\u00a0\u00a0 detective solving the mystery of Grandma\u00a0 Ursula in a brand new series of ads that\u00a0\u00a0 they had released literally the same day. And so, as you'd expect, the Internet was\u00a0\u00a0 going nuts. Danny Gonzalez literally dropped\u00a0 everything to make a reaction video to this. But to me, those ads just seemed\u00a0 to once again confirm everything\u00a0\u00a0 that I talked about in my past theories. Like Pedro, my guy, just look over\u00a0 here. I got two videos with all the\u00a0\u00a0 evidence that you need. I literally\u00a0 did your job for you a year ago.\u00a0 Unless, of course, there's something else going on\u00a0 here. Looking through Pedro's trailers. There was\u00a0\u00a0 something new that I noticed. Someone who kept\u00a0 getting an unusual amount of screen time. This\u00a0\u00a0 guy. They show wedding photos, family portraits\u00a0 and other characters talk about a missing body. This was clearly the mystery that the guys at\u00a0 Merge Mansion wanted me to solve. Who is this\u00a0\u00a0 man? What happened to him? And how did it all\u00a0 relate to my visit to the mansion? We were about\u00a0\u00a0 to find out. After arriving at the mansion, one\u00a0 thing became crystal clear. Lore was everywhere:\u00a0\u00a0 Conspiracy boards, props, pictures\u00a0 and postcards. They went hard on this\u00a0\u00a0 thing. And through it all, only one\u00a0 thing kept running through my mind. Yes, yes, it was. We were told that we'd be entering the mansion\u00a0\u00a0 in small groups and that Pedro would be doing the\u00a0 whole thing solo later that day. And with that,\u00a0\u00a0 my dreams of recreating my Grogu fan fiction\u00a0 with him were canceled\u2026 Temporarily. Anyway,\u00a0\u00a0 it was time to finally enter the house. The event\u00a0 was probably best described as an escape room the\u00a0\u00a0 size of a mansion, all set in the Hollywood Hills. It took us from the library to a hidden kitchen in\u00a0\u00a0 the basement, even up to a secret security\u00a0 office hidden through the fireplace. Before eventually coming full circle back\u00a0 to the main floor and grandma's dining hall,\u00a0\u00a0 where she set up a little bait and\u00a0 switch for us. Distracting us with\u00a0\u00a0 a mannequin while she slipped\u00a0 out the back. So even though\u00a0\u00a0 Grandma Ursula ultimately eluded our\u00a0 grasp, the whole thing wasn't a bust.\u00a0 First, the box that was sent to me at the\u00a0 beginning of the event confirmed that of\u00a0\u00a0 the three hand messages that we saw in those\u00a0 Merge Mansion ads, one of them was Canonical. \u201cHe is alive\u201d. So who then is \u201che\u201d? Well,\u00a0 all along the path, throughout the mansion\u00a0\u00a0 there was one name that kept coming up\u00a0 over and over again: Grandpa Charlie. In both the Pedro Pascal ads and the live action\u00a0 event, Grandpa Charlie appears to be the lynchpin,\u00a0\u00a0 the secret, unspoken character that has Easter\u00a0 eggs about him littered everywhere. Now,\u00a0\u00a0 I initially wrote him off in our earlier theories\u00a0 just because he seemed like nothing more than\u00a0\u00a0 a passing mention. And whenever anyone did bring\u00a0 him up, it seemed to be implying that he was dead.\u00a0 Little did I realize, though, that that's kind\u00a0 of the point. They want you to think that he's\u00a0\u00a0 dead. He's the only character that would make\u00a0 sense in this family photo from the new ads. I don\u2019t know what you're complaining about here\u00a0 Pedro, this detective work is easy. But okay,\u00a0\u00a0 we have our victim, now we need\u00a0 to figure out what happened.\u00a0 As I said, initially I dismissed Charlie because\u00a0 he seemed to be dead in the game's dialog,\u00a0\u00a0 so checking back in on the game felt like a\u00a0 good place to start. And let me just say this\u00a0\u00a0 is not the same game that I researched a year\u00a0 ago. The game itself is still the same. You're\u00a0\u00a0 still merging items together to form new ones, and\u00a0 you're still trying to fix up the mansion grounds.\u00a0 But the story and character dialog has received\u00a0 a massive update. Old scenes are no longer there\u00a0\u00a0 and new ones have been put in their places,\u00a0 ones that focus very specifically on the\u00a0\u00a0 mystery of what happened to Grandpa Charlie.\u00a0 From the get go, Maddie is trying to figure\u00a0\u00a0 out what happened to her parents, but also\u00a0 Grandpa Charlie. Eventually we learn that\u00a0\u00a0 Charlie never set foot in the mansion. He was from a poor family, he was not\u00a0\u00a0 interested in wealth and he was loved by many.\u00a0 All of which are fine little details but they're\u00a0\u00a0 not really helping us get to the bottom of the\u00a0 mystery. The closest thing we get to that is a\u00a0\u00a0 gold watch that Maddie finds that once belonged to\u00a0 Grandpa Charlie, given to him by Grandma Ursula.\u00a0 Ursula wants that thing thrown out, but Maddie\u00a0 keeps it and starts asking around town to see if\u00a0\u00a0 anyone has any other information. This, though,\u00a0 is what leads the police to use it as evidence\u00a0\u00a0 to arrest Ursula, leading to the iconic ad of\u00a0 Ursula in the back of the cop car. And that\u00a0\u00a0 right there, that's when it hit me. The recent CG videos that have been\u00a0\u00a0 put onto the Merge Mansion YouTube channel\u00a0 originally felt like a lot of nothing burgers,\u00a0\u00a0 or nothing pies I suppose. They were just\u00a0 Grandma Ursula being shady, but not that\u00a0\u00a0 I'm-actually-a-murderer kind of way. I didn't\u00a0 really know what to make of them. But thinking\u00a0\u00a0 about this now with the new understanding\u00a0 that her husband, Grandpa Charlie, is alive,\u00a0\u00a0 I think I've got an idea of what's going on. What if the reason Ursula's being shady is\u00a0\u00a0 because she knows where Grandpa Charlie is?\u00a0 In the video Left or Right?, we see Maddie\u00a0\u00a0 follow Ursula into a snow storm. But when she\u00a0 catches up, Ursula's footprints go one way and\u00a0\u00a0 the sledge of supplies that she was dragging\u00a0 go the opposite way, thereby implying that\u00a0\u00a0 someone else grabbed them and took them away. Charlie, it was all to see, and also help\u00a0\u00a0 Charlie. But why? Why would she want to keep\u00a0 him a secret? Sadly, this is where the trail\u00a0\u00a0 ran cold. I dug through so much in-game dialog,\u00a0 went frame by frame for every video ever released,\u00a0\u00a0 I even spent an unsettling amount of time doing\u00a0 the unthinkable and *gasp* playing the game to\u00a0\u00a0 see if there were any secrets in the item merging\u00a0 sections, but I ultimately came up empty handed.\u00a0 Much like Daddy Pascal\u2026 I mean Detective\u00a0 Pascal, I couldn't figure it out. Or at\u00a0\u00a0 least I couldn't until I reexamined all those\u00a0 papers that they sent to me in their challenge.\u00a0\u00a0 In the middle of all those files, blueprints,\u00a0 and newspaper clippings, there was one series\u00a0\u00a0 of documents that literally blew the case\u00a0 wide open, a series of journal entries. That right there? That isn't just chicken scratch.\u00a0 That is the diary of Grandpa Charlie himself.\u00a0\u00a0 This is him marrying Ursula, again highlighting\u00a0 their lack of finances with a small and simple\u00a0\u00a0 ceremony and money would actually become a\u00a0 running theme throughout all of the entries.\u00a0 They also get a whole lot harder to read, gotta be\u00a0 honest, I wasn't able to fully decipher them all,\u00a0\u00a0 but I think I have enough understanding as to\u00a0 what's going on. So here's my rough translation. This. This right here is the smoking gun loyal\u00a0 theorist. This tells us everything we need to\u00a0\u00a0 know. Not only was Charlie a poor man before\u00a0 he got married to Ursula, he continued to be a\u00a0\u00a0 poor man afterwards, they were struggling to make\u00a0 mortgage payments and any money that he did make,\u00a0\u00a0 he was thrown away on drinking and gambling,\u00a0 tale as old as time. What's interesting, though,\u00a0\u00a0 is we're also introduced to a character that\u00a0 we've never heard of before: Leonard Boulton,\u00a0\u00a0 Ursula's brother. And while we don't learn a whole\u00a0 lot about him, the main takeaway is that this guy\u00a0\u00a0 is wrapped up in some unsavory businesses. He's the kind of brother in law that always\u00a0\u00a0 has a get rich quick scheme going on. And sadly,\u00a0 the situation Charlie finds himself in means that\u00a0\u00a0 he has to go along with it. Unfortunately, it\u00a0 seems like the last scheme that these two pull\u00a0\u00a0 is ultimately their downfall. When I was looking\u00a0 at the Detective Cork Board from the live event\u00a0\u00a0 I noticed one very odd detail. There was\u00a0 a piece of paper pinned that was from an\u00a0\u00a0 official government document. More specifically,\u00a0 references to the foreign agricultural trade of\u00a0\u00a0 the United States. Weird, right? Something\u00a0 about it just felt out of place here. So\u00a0\u00a0 I spent my day doing the most fun thing on\u00a0 the planet, deciphering government financial\u00a0\u00a0 documents. Yeah, I definitely know how to party. I won't bore you with all the details here,\u00a0\u00a0 but basically these documents track the U.S\u2019s\u00a0 import and export of agricultural foods,\u00a0\u00a0 things like wheat, rice, vegetables, fruit,\u00a0 cotton, sugar, coffee. It keeps track of the\u00a0\u00a0 rise and fall of what other countries are\u00a0 buying and selling to us and whether the\u00a0\u00a0 market is good or bad. It's important data. But looking at the files from the dates on\u00a0\u00a0 the corkboard revealed something that started\u00a0 to explain Charlie's predicament. Generally,\u00a0\u00a0 agricultural prices continued to go down for\u00a0 that period, which if these two men were invested\u00a0\u00a0 in those trades, would have left them with\u00a0 less profits. And when you owe people money,\u00a0\u00a0 that's not going to be great. But\u00a0 there was one market in particular\u00a0\u00a0 that was most affected throughout those dates. Slowly but surely, throughout the 1980s, the\u00a0\u00a0 U.S. stopped sending freights full of agricultural\u00a0 stock to Russia. The Cold War was at its height,\u00a0\u00a0 and so the U.S. stopped selling and more\u00a0 importantly, buying from Russia. However, during\u00a0\u00a0 the seventies and eighties, the U.S. did increase\u00a0 the rates of immigration into the country,\u00a0\u00a0 specifically from Russia, which led to the rise\u00a0 of the Russian mafia in the U.S., a mafia that\u00a0\u00a0 would do what it could to smuggle goods to and\u00a0 from their homeland, which sounds like a pretty\u00a0\u00a0 good match for these unsavory characters that\u00a0 Charlie and Leonard find themselves indebted to.\u00a0 If they weren't making much from their usual\u00a0 agricultural sales or worse, weren't able to\u00a0\u00a0 keep up with their end of the debts by smuggling\u00a0 high value items in and out of the country,\u00a0\u00a0 then that would lead to a very bad ending for\u00a0 both of them. Which leads me to my conclusion\u00a0\u00a0 on all of this. Where's Grandpa Charlie now? Simple. He's on the run. He's in hiding. He\u00a0\u00a0 wasn't able to pay back the loan sharks, and so\u00a0 they came after him and he did the only thing\u00a0\u00a0 that he could. He ran. Leaving his wife and child\u00a0 behind in order to protect them. That's why we\u00a0\u00a0 see Ursula stealing and destroying evidence, she's\u00a0 trying to hide any sign of where Charlie might be.\u00a0 It's also why Ursula is willing to go to prison\u00a0 for him. She doesn't want anyone finding him\u00a0\u00a0 and killing him. So is Grandma Ursula a murderer?\u00a0 Doesn't really look like it. She's just a lady who\u00a0\u00a0 loves some bloody pie and has a passion for knife\u00a0 collection. Perhaps the true mystery meat in the\u00a0\u00a0 pies was that there was no meat all along. But hey, that's just a theory.\u00a0\u00a0 A GAME THEORY! Thanks for watching. And hey, if you wanted to cypher more random\u00a0\u00a0 lore about meat based products, click the video\u00a0 that you see on screen right now to see if you\u00a0\u00a0 can eat a dress made of meat. How many calories\u00a0 is that and how is it possible that it's still\u00a0\u00a0 in a museum to this very day? I don't know.\u00a0 Maybe they turned it to Jerky or something?\u00a0\u00a0 We're going to find out. As always, my friends,\u00a0 thanks for watching. I'll see you next week."

      "corpus": "(upbeat music) - Hi everyone. Welcome to Yoga With Adriene. I'm Adriene. Here's Benji. We're gonna jump right in with this five minute full body stretch. Take a deep breath in. And wherever you are as you exhale, relax the shoulders meaning wherever you are mentally, however you're feeling physically. Take another deep breath in. And exhale again. Relax your shoulders. Feel them dropping away down from the ears. And one more time, deep breath in. And this time draw the shoulder blades together, imagine them melting down the back as you lift the chest. Beautiful. We're gonna come to all fours for Cat-Cow, so nice and slow. See if you can keep up that nice slow deep breathing as we consciously stretch the body here. Inhale, drop the belly,  open the chest. Oh my gosh, Benji's so cute. Exhale, round through the spine. Move slow here. Really feeling the front body and the back body stretch it out as you breathe. Inhaling the belly drops and the crown of the head extends. And then exhale, round the spine, the chin comes to the chest and the navel really draws up towards the spine. One more time really exaggerating this movement, feeling this stretch. Nice, and then widen the knees  as wide as your yoga mat, send the hips back, stretch the fingertips forward. So really active arms here. Then lift the  center of your palm so just your fingerprints are pressing into the mat. Wrists are reaching up  towards the ceiling and then we'll slowly begin to melt the chest  and the shoulders, maybe the head down and you feel this  traction in the arms, in the shoulders and the upper back. Now breathe, feel the expansion as you inhale through all four sides of the torso. So expanding through all four sides. Good, and then exhale, hug the low ribs in and feel that stretch deepen. Lovely. Slowly come back up to all fours, Tabletop Position. On your next inhale, reach the right arm forward, the left foot, the left leg back. Now imagine someone's pulling your right wrist and pulling your left ankle. So we're really focusing on the stretch today. Hug those low ribs up and in, slight bend in your left elbow so it's not locked. Then drop your left hip in line with your right hip  as you breathe in. Good, exhale, round everything. Think Cat here. Good, inhale, extension, stretch it out. And exhale, rounding the spine, feeling that low back stretch as you hug the low ribs in. Good. One more inhale, reach. Spread the fingers, spread the toes. And exhale, round through. Good, release and switch. Left fingertips forward, right toes back, stretch it out. Deep breath from Benji. Nice, exhale, round it through. So again, we're focusing  on the stretch today. So stabilize  with your foundation and then really focus on reaching, reaching, reaching as you extend out. And then as you  hug it in, focus on bringing the low ribs up  towards the spine so you really feel that stretch in the back. You'll feel your  abs turn on too, bonus. Inhale, reach it forward. Exhale, bring it in. Good, walk both hands out now. Curl the toes under, take a deep breath in. Keep the knees bent as you peel the tailbone up towards the sky and then slowly drop the heels down towards the earth. Bend your right knee as you anchor the left heel. Feel the stretch in the back of that left leg. And then switch. Right heel comes down, bend the left knee. Stretching the right leg. Now both knees bend. Think about  bringing your hip points higher up towards the ceiling as you stretch,  stretch, stretch. Heart melts towards the knees here. And then both heels down. Breathe in. And slowly breathe out. Bring the knees back to the earth and come into a seat. Good, we're gonna end with a Forward Fold. So send your legs out in front. Inhale, reach for the sky. Exhale, feel free to bend the knees or you can keep 'em straight here as you come into Paschimottanasana. You can always work to build that length in the hamstring, rounding forward. Take a deep breath in. Stretching the calves as you flex the toes up towards your head. Feeling that stretch in the back of the knee, the hamstring. And if you're really tight in the low back, go ahead and bend those  knees for one more breath and feel that love in the  lower back as you breathe in. And to release. On a exhale, slowly roll up. We'll bring one ankle in and then the other. Draw the hands to the heart space. Inhale, bring the thumbs up to the third eye. May we continue to stretch throughout our day. Keeping an open mind and open heart. And I hope you feel good in your body. Thank you for being here today. Inhale in. Exhale to bow. Namaste. (upbeat music)"

every single week if y'all are wondering why I'm in a different location I just barely flew into Joshua Tree because Coachella is this weekend and I'm super excited but naturally I am just stressed out of my mind it's so crazy busy I literally just got here and sat down to film this video so if you think I look a little rough screw you I look great I think I look pretty good after a flight anyway this video is going to be a continuation of my Series where I answer your guys's skincare questions I've already covered acne scars eczema and now we are on to dry skin dry skin babes listen oh if you have had to go through the pain of extremely dry tight skin maybe even a little bit of flakiness you are entitled to financial conversation you guys have asked me so many questions about dry skin across YouTube Instagram Tick Tock and I am here to answer as many as I possibly can in one single video and before I jump into it if you have any questions about your skin concerns please comment them on my YouTube channel Instagram or Tick Tock because I will be using them in future videos in the continuation of this series so make sure you comment them and all the products that I'm going to talk about in today's video will be linked in the description box below if you do want to support me on my channel I make a small commission from those links but they're just there's a resource in case you do decide to do some shopping no pressure whatsoever as always so let's get into it so Teresa asks do you have any recommended skin products for dry skin my skin gets really dry so I started to apply Vicks on the dry spots which is on around my nose I put on moisturizer every day I use the Cetaphil one okay first up I definitely do not recommend to fix it contains really strong concentrations of fragrance and essential oil which will irritate your dry skin areas I would say opt for other petrolatum based products my personal favorites are the CeraVe healing ointments which has ceramides in it to replenish and hydrate this skin it's a similar feel and consistency to Vicks but without the risk of the irritation or sensitivity or if you want a really simple option that you can pretty much find anywhere Aquaphor healing ointment great one as well but as opposed to just using that on its own I recommend applying a moisturizer underneath because a petrolatum based product will only be a seal on the surface of your skin but it's not really going to moisturize your skin that's what a moisturizer is for and then the petrolatinum product will kind of serve as a force field protectant over the top to make sure you don't lose any additional water from your skin for affordable moisturizers for dry skin I recommend the bioma moisturizing Rich cream a really nice consistency that works well to really deeply nourish any dry areas you have or the elf happy hydration cream that one does have CBD in it to help calm any irritation or redness or if you do want to splurge on a really good moisturizer my personal favorite for dry skin is the skin fix triple lipid barrier peptide cream I just cannot sing enough phrases to that product it is the best of the best so or amazing for dry skin put Jesus first sorry that username makes me laugh but work put Jesus first what should we use to cleanse slash exfoliate I have dry slash very dry skin I also have sensitive skin and it has recently been reddish so I feel the struggle I struggle with dryness on my cheeks and also overall redness prone skin for exfoliating I really recommend ingredients like phas or mandelic acid both of which are humectants which will help to draw in moisture from the air into your skin which is great for dryness plus they're both really gentle but still effective to work ideally for dry skin and avoid scrubs like the plague oh my gosh I'm never a fan of Scrubs but if you have dry skin that is like one of the worst things you can do avoid them for phas I recommend the inky list PHA toner or if you want a combination of both phas and mandelic acid in one formula the selfless by Hiram mandelic acid serum has a bunch of good exfoliating ingredients to work for your skin but it really works amazingly for very sensitive or irritated skin it is still the only exfoliating product to this day that I can use on my very sensitive neck but it still gets the job done for exfoliation and then for a cleanser that reduces sensitivity I would look for anything that includes centella green tea or specifically matcha like the Crave Beauty matcha hemp hydrating cleanser so good for dry skin very gentle but has amazing ingredients to help reduce that redness and sensitivity you might be experiencing Ivy asked hi I'm a 13 year old girl and I've started skincare just over a year ago congratulations that's so awesome I'm so proud of you for starting so young your skin is going to look gorgeous throughout your life keep it up I have clear dry skin and the facial sunscreen I buy is so expensive for such a little portion do you have any good affordable sunscreens with at least 30 SPF thank you of course affordable sunscreens are my passion I would definitely recommend checking out my best sunscreens of 2022 video because I organize them all by skin type price point and each of the benefits but the main two that come to mind the beauty of joseon SPF 50 sunscreen wow is this formula incredible I've gotten so many people in my life addicted to this sunscreen because it's so good you can find it for 13 it lasts a long time and gives a little bit of a nice glow to it which is great for dry skin or the essential hyaluronic acid SPF 50 sunscreen as well this one has a cult following it's really really popular and I totally understand why and the hyaluronic acid in it will be great if your skin suffers from dehydration and you can find it under 20 but like I said definitely go check out my best sunscreens of 2022 because I have a lot more recommendations there Emma asked hi there I found your channel from Kendall's podcast oh my gosh thank you so much for watching if you guys don't listen to my podcast just position I highly recommend it I collaborate with a bunch of your favorite creators and one of them was the one and only Kendall Ray who was absolutely incredible so thank you so much for listening as someone who struggles to find a good sunscreen because my skin breaks out and hives with any SPF above 25 and has super dry skin do you have any recommendations I struggle to find any that are out or below SPF 25. so if you do find that you break out in hives or have a sensitive reaction to sunscreens I definitely recommend opting for mineral sunscreens particularly sunscreens that only have zinc oxide because compared to chemical sunscreens or even titanium dioxide zinc oxide has the lowest risk of making your skin freak out and I personally recommend the pipette SPF 50. it's a great affordable sunscreen and particularly good if you do have dry skin because it has a richer formula or the Sun by mineral SPF 30 sunscreen this has been one of my favorites for a while but I will say keep in mind if this concern continues and you notice yourself breaking out in hives with whatever sunscreen you use that's one I definitely recommend going to a dermatologist or a doctor to get that checked out because that could be signifying more severe skin allergens that you might have and that's something that only a dermatologist would be able to help out with so keep a close eye on your skin see how the recommendation works I'm sorry I wish there was more I could help with but sometimes you really just need a doctor to help you out with those kinds of things Tita asks can I use first aid coconut water cream for dry skin no no no no baby I mean here's the thing everyone's skin reacts differently to products but I will say first APD coconut water cream is one of my favorites for very very oily skin but if you have dry skin that's definitely not not going to be moisturizing enough and instead I would recommend the first aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream I have loved that moisturizer forever it's really good for dry skin dehydration definitely opt for that one because as much as I love the coconut water cream and it has been one of my top favorites for years it is definitely for the most oily of skin types not dry skin I'm sorry I hope you didn't buy the product already but could you please recommend something really simple and affordable with basic routine to follow for dry skin with acne all over the face yes of course that is one of the top questions I get asked about when it comes to dry skin what do I do if I have dry skin and I have acne it's a really tricky concern but here are the products I recommend first like I said before the Crave Beauty matcha hemp hydrating cleanser amazing for dry skin and reducing that sensitivity you might experience for a treatment I recommend the selfless mandelic acid serum because it has a blend of ingredients that are humectants to help with that dryness gently exfoliate the skin but not aggravate any sensitivity plus it has a little bit of salicylic acid to help with those acne and breakout concerns as well for a moisturizer the Aveeno eczema gel cream I recently discovered this one and it is so good I love it because the formula is really targeted at anyone who has severely dry skin but it's a gel cream so it's very lightweight and doesn't look super greasy super heavy on the skin and potentially contribute to the discomfort you may experience from acne and then finally for a sense screen I recommend the hero Cosmetics SPF 30 sunscreen this was listed as my top sunscreen of 2022 because it's just such a beautiful formula it has a slight green tint to offset any redness that you might experience from those breakouts it's a mineral formula it's affordable just a great product overall as always feel free to test out products see which ones work for your skin but those would be my main recommendations for anyone who is struggling with dry skin and breakouts nursage asks hi can anyone help me I have dry skin can I apply snail Essence snail mucin is such an underrated ingredient in my opinion and amazing if you have dry skin it sounds a little weird but the benefits for your skin are really incredible and it really helps with giving you very bouncy plump hydrated glowy skin oh it's amazing that's one of those ingredients where I sometimes wish my skin was a little bit more dry because of how beautiful it makes the skin look but with my oily areas it's just uh yeah that's not gonna happen if you have very dry skin I recommend the Kazar X snail mucin Essence that one is best for that really intense glowy appearance or if you want a little bit more of a lightweight serum the beauty of joseon ginseng and snail Essence is an awesome choice plus you get the benefits of ginseng with it either one those are my top two picks for snail music Essence it is such a great ingredient for dry skin Sora asked a good question if I have eczema do I have dry skin great question and I definitely recommend going and watching my video dedicated to answering your guys's questions about Eczema but here's the thing eczema is dry skin but dry skin is not eczema eczema is a skin condition that consists of a severely impaired moisture barrier flaky skin pain discomfort cracks in the skin and sometimes in extreme cases like what I've experienced bleeding eczema is brutal and if you want to learn more about that definitely go watch my video but if you don't experience those specific things then I would say you definitely have more dry skin while they seem similar they're definitely not the same thing anandita oh I love you guys names they're so cool asked what should someone with dry skin who lives in a dry climate be using IF hyaluronic acid isn't ideal super good question and a lot of people aren't aware of this hyaluronic acid is definitely praised as like the best skincare ingredient ever but in my opinion A lot of times it can be a little bit over hyped and if you are someone who lives in a dry environment who also has dry skin hyaluronic acid is definitely not ideal for you because the way that it works is that it attracts moisture from the air but if you're applying a hyaluronic acid serum on your face and there's really no moisture in the air like here in Joshua Tree for example the middle of the desert it will instead pull water from within your skin increasing that dehydration and dryness you are experiencing my alternative ingredient recommendations is first glycerin it is such an underrated ingredient and glycerin you can really find in so many different products thankfully but glycerin is great for addressing dryness without the possible concerns that hyaluronic acid has with it centellasiatica is another incredible ingredient for increasing the hydration within the skin you can find some teleasiatica and a bunch of Brands as well it's in selfless by Hiram products but you can also find it in a lot of Korean skincare products as well or another ingredient that a lot of people don't really know about polyglutamic acid amazing for deeply hydrating and nourishing the skin in a similar way to hyaluronic acid but in my opinion it is better than hyaluronic acid but yeah this would be my alternative ingredients and then finally Taylor asks I'm really starting to think that there is something wrong with my skin I live in Florida my home is usually around 50 to 60 percent humidity and I use a steamer and then later on at least three moisturizing products after and I still have dry skin what should I do so I could sit here and give you product recommendations I could give you skin care hacks but I think given the amount of effort that you are putting in to ensure your skin has as much moisture and hydration in your environment as possible and you're still experiencing skin dryness I would definitely recommend going to a dermatologist with these concerns because that definitely signifies that something is just not adding up in your skin it's not quite making sense because for most other people you would definitely see an increase of moisture on your skin but if you're still not I think a Derma dermatologist can really be helpful in helping you with those concerns the only thing I would add on is to try slugging slugging is one of the best solutions for helping to ensure that your skin doesn't lose water throughout the day or night and you just use the petrolatum based product like CeraVe healing ointment or Aquaphor all over your face at night that will help to seal water into your skin which sometimes moisturizes on their own just aren't able to do but if that still doesn't work definitely go to a dermatologist because your skin should be seeing an increase in moisture and hydration and if you are concerned about the price point of a dermatologist I would say check out services like dramatica or curology they're able to give you some Dermatology advice for a much lower price point than say going to a traditional dermatologist but yeah that would be my best recommendation I know it's not ideal and it can be pricey but let me tell you it will save you a lot of expenses of having to buy so many different products for dry skin down the road okay and those are all the questions I am going to finish with this video because it is almost dark outside and once it is dark uh yeah the filming stops but thank you guys so much for asking these questions there were a whole lot more but they were basically all asking the same type of things as what I covered in this video but if you do have any additional questions or concerns please comment them down below I would love to respond or include them in future videos be sure to check out my other videos in this series as well and if you don't see your specific skin concern included please comment yours because I would love to make a dedicated video to it in the future like I said before all the products that I've talked about in today's video are listed in the description box below if you do want to do some shopping and if you guys haven't already be sure to subscribe to my channel and hit the notification Bell so you can see

      "corpus": "I literally do not understand someone could create so much tyranny and destruction in a house for four days what's up guys it's Ava welcome back to my channel okay today we're doing a video that I did not expect to be filming whatsoever this is not a video I plan to do I wasn't planning on doing like a I rented my house out for Coachella on Airbnb type video but because of the circumstances I feel like I need to make this video because I'm living in this real time and as a historical archive on my life I just feel like this video has to be made because what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is going on um also I'm currently wearing a bikini which I know some of y'all in the comments are gonna be like why is Ava always naked she's always in a bikini shut the [\u00a0__\u00a0] up it's hot as [\u00a0__\u00a0] okay I'm here it's hot to give you a perspective on how hot it is I went out to lunch like four hours ago and I have been asleep since I got home from lunch because it was so hot outside the heat just like knocked me out and to be completely honest with you I just woke up from that nap about 20 minutes ago and this bikini is really the only thing keeping me alive right now okay so we'll start with like the basic details we'll just get them out of the way if you guys don't know I bought a house in Palm Springs a year ago last summer and since I bought this house I've been working on it and renovating it and pouring every inch of my damn body and soul and mental health into this house finally just finished the house last month and was able to live out my dream of moving to New York so if you guys haven't seen that Vlog that was a vlog that I posted a couple days ago of me moving and since moving to New York a huge weight has just been lifted off my shoulders because when I tell you I worked so hard on this house like it definitely took a toll on my mental health but getting the house done has been the proudest feeling and being able to look around and see like like this sofa everything about the sofa behind me I built from scratch I built this chair that you see behind me like I built that everything in this house means a lot to me the point of buying this house was a couple different things the number one thing being I didn't want to live in California however California is my home state I do want Roots here even though I don't necessarily want to be here full time I had never lived outside California in my life and so moving to New York was scary because it was like I don't know how long I'm gonna want to be there I don't know if I'm gonna end up in New York for the next five years and then I started thinking about what the cost of homes are going to be in five years a lot of you guys know I owned a house in La I sold that house to find something else in my search of buying my second house I looked in New York I looked in Washington I looked in La so many places and for many many reasons some of which are very sentimental my heart landed on Palm Springs so that's why I have a house here obviously it's a real estate investment I didn't want to have all the money that I spent on my first home not be invest did in something Palm Springs was just the perfect place for me to feel comfortable having an investment in California in a place that I'm very familiar with I love vacationing in Palm Springs it just made sense and I love Palm Springs I love this house I love this house so this is where things get interesting okay we had our first guest in early April and it honestly went amazing it was a family with two kids and a dog they respected the house they loved the house we learned a ton from that experience and they left us this amazing review which made me honestly want to cry I didn't cry because I stopped myself but like I honestly wanted to cry because it was like that was the first moment I realized all of my hard work was worth it because it's different when you hear it from like your friends and your family where they're like oh my gosh congrats the house is done you did such a great job but to hear it from someone that doesn't owe you anything and could honestly be like the house was like all right to get that review validated a lot of things in me so here we come into our second booking Coachella weekend one and I want a high I'm like [\u00a0__\u00a0] yes our first review was amazing we're gonna get a second review it's gonna be awesome we're gonna crush it we're gonna be the best guest in a building okay so basically so we get a booking for Coachella weekend one and this is how much our house costed did for Coachella weekend one I believe for Coachella weekend one the house was going for a little over a thousand dollars I think it was like thirteen hundred dollars a night now whoa whoa okay I I hear you you're probably thinking that's a lot of money for a booking for Coachella most houses in Palm Springs for Coachella go for around fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars a night especially the houses that have four bedrooms they're more Uncommon in Palm Springs my house is a luxury house it's filled with luxury Furniture we have four bedrooms tons of amenities but that's how much we charge and it was booked when we get the booking okay I get this email from Airbnb and it's like hey we haven't been able to verify let's just call her Alaska we're gonna call her Alaska okay the girl that books this Airbnb okay so I get an email immediately after Alaska books my house and it goes hey um we're having some trouble processing Alaska's payment so this reservation isn't confirmed yet until we process Alaska's payment method the email to be honest it felt a little bit suspicious it felt kind of like Airbnb was like we don't know if this person's legit or not if it's like actually a human if it's a bot like it just sounded like Airbnb was a little bit sketched out by Alaska but I'm over here thinking like please Alaska please be a real human please do not be a bot because I would really like to have my house booked for Coachella and I would really really like to have a second review that's really really good meanwhile Alaska starts messaging me from a second Airbnb account I didn't even realize that it was a second Airbnb account at first because it was coming from the same name and it was the same dates so I just figured it was all flowing but basically I started messaging with Alaska she's like hey I'm coming for Coachella we have four people I figure out all the details with Alaska and I'm excited to host her for Coachella because honestly it sounds stupid but like it it has been a dream of mine to be able to host someone for Coachella in my own house in Palm Springs it's cool like coming from a person that goes to the festival looks at airbnbs during Coachella gets excited to find a place to go with all your friends being on the other side of that and giving that good experience to someone else when you host people that are like families all the time it's obviously cool but being able to host someone in your same age group that's just like coming with their friends it's special to me so I get the email that Alaska's reservation has gone through I get the email from Airbnb they're like hey we processed that payment never mind go ahead and book Alaska she's good on our end she's good to go there we have it we have the house booked for Coachella weekend one so we get the house ready we buy some snacks for Alaska's friends we give her the gate code she wants an early check-in because some of her friends were landing at 10 A.M even though check-ins at 3 P.M so we accommodate a faster check-in for her and here we [\u00a0__\u00a0] go okay Alaska's in the house now the whole Coachella booking I'm in New York and at my house I have a ring security camera and I have a keypad door lock and let me just be straight with you guys I do not watch anyone on my camera the camera is purely to see if anyone steals my damn packages that's it but I have on my phone I have like notifications whenever someone opens my door or like locks my door which is purely for safety because I want to know if someone is like randomly unlocking my door in the middle of the night when you own a house and you're 3000 miles away and you don't know what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is going on there so it's been good to have some sort of security notification to know what's going on in my house but let me tell you the day that Alaska shows up at my house when I tell you I was getting door notifications I probably got 70 door notifications a day which is an absurd amount of door notifications for four people looked like all of the people in the house were fully on their own [\u00a0__\u00a0] program because it would be like door locks door unlocked five minutes later door locked door unlocked 20 minutes later door locked door unlocked five minutes later door locked door unlocked two hours later door locked door unlocked door locked door unlocked locked unlocked locked unlocked five in the morning door unlocked unlocked unlocked I was like what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] going on here but I was like you know what you know what you know what they're at Coachella they're at a festival you know there's a lot of things going on throughout the day maybe they needed to go pick up breakfast someone else wanted to go somewhere else I don't know maybe they all got home at different times at Coachella they all went in different groups I guess I don't know but it was like it was confusing to me as someone that's gone to Coachella every single person in the house was coming home at different hours of the night it was like but I digress okay I digress point is it's like the third day of Coachella okay it's Sunday weekend one I wake up at eight in the morning and I get this email by Airbnb they emailed this email at 4 35 in the morning and it reads hi Ava I hope this message finds you well my name is edwig from the 24-hour safety support line unfortunately due to time zone differences I'm unable to call you at this time so we'll be proceeding via message for now I'm reaching out to inform you that Airbnb has determined we are unable to support reservation blah blah blah with Alaska and we are moving forward with canceling it the reservation will not be reinstated if your guest has already arrived please make sure that checkout occurs as soon as possible so here I am okay in New York with a group of four people staying at my home going in and out 70 times a day and Airbnb is now telling me I need to forcibly remove them like I need to call them and kick them out of my house and I have no idea why I have no idea what they did I have no idea what I did I have no idea what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is going on I don't know if these people are criminals in my house I don't know if they're freaking robbers thank you I don't know if I have like [\u00a0__\u00a0] ax murderers at my house I don't know if a murder went on I don't know what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is going on like truly it could have been anything I just remember seeing one Tick Tock of someone saying that this happened to them but as a guest where Airbnb messaged them and just said like you need to get out immediately but they didn't tell them why and now here I am in that position but from the homeowner perspective where I'm getting an email from Airbnb saying whoever's in your house needs to [\u00a0__\u00a0] leave right now if they're still in your house which of course they are why would they not be they need to leave immediately well first I email back Airbnb and I say what's going on her group is at my home currently I haven't received any messages from her no response from Airbnb for hours so I go and I message Alaska and I'm like hey I just got an email from Airbnb it's really confusing do you know anything about this before we call them and try to figure it out no response from Alaska okay zero she goes radio [\u00a0__\u00a0] silent so I have my assistant call Airbnb that morning and just try to figure out what's going on she gets on the phone with Airbnb and Airbnb goes yeah I don't know what's happening we don't have a cancellation on our end must be an accident that email must have just been sent as an accident false alarm and I'm just like how do you send that email as an accident so at this point it's like 1pm we go and we message Alaska we say hey we talked to Airbnb turns out it was a false alarm I don't know what's going on but like continue to be at the house what else am I supposed to do to which then also let's talk about the fact that Alaska didn't even respond to that message so she just stops responding at this point I see her going in and out of my house on the freaking locks so then [\u00a0__\u00a0] so then at four o'clock in the afternoon I get another email from Airbnb that reads hi Ava I'm Ben with Airbnb I just attempted to reach you by phone but was unable to make contact with you I'm reaching out to inform you that Alaska's reservation will be canceled because Airbnb determined it could not be supported the reservation will not be reinstated if your guest is still the listing make sure checkout occurs as soon as possible okay so now it's 4 P.M I call Airbnb at this point and I'm just like Hey I what is going on by now I've called twice you guys keep saying on the phone that this is an accident that the email should be disregarded the guest is still in my house right now she hasn't responded to me all day I don't know what's going on like I what is what is happening the Airbnb representative on the phone informs me that this actually is a [\u00a0__\u00a0] cancellation and this guest needs to leave immediately and they can't disclose details but she needs to go she needs to go so I said I can't get a hold of her but I know she's at a music festival if it's Coachella which I know it is she's not gonna be back in my house until four in the morning and she doesn't even have service at the festival also she's probably drunk as she freaking should be she's getting her dance on and like you know what's [\u00a0__\u00a0] up is like I don't know if this qualifies me as an empath but the whole time this is going on the whole time I'm getting the most like suspicious emails from Airbnb being like get this person out of your home I'm like feeling bad for her and I'm just like damn this poor girl is at a music festival partying her freaking time of her life she's probably waited for this for a long time she got off work she flew to California to go to this music festival and she has to deal with all this [\u00a0__\u00a0] I'm like on her side for some reason I'm like automatically on her side because the whole time I was trying to think like what could this be what could she have done and in my head I genuinely was like this is probably just a billing issue they probably just couldn't like secure payment details they probably something on like the Airbnb like interface just kind of [\u00a0__\u00a0] up and like it just ended up putting her in a bad situation I didn't think she was doing anything suspicious okay wait hold on now I have the responsibility to literally remove someone from my house that's literally my age probably my age while I'm in New York and she's at a festival and she's probably [\u00a0__\u00a0] lit so basically they said that they would reach out to her they would deal with getting her out of the Airbnb so that she wouldn't like hate me and like spray paint my walls basketball to the next day it is now 11 A.M and we still have not gotten any response from Alaska we haven't gotten any response from Airbnb if she's left my house we finally get the email that Alaska has left my house and when my assistant goes into the house as she does after every booking before the cleaning team comes in thank God we see how Alaska left the house [Music] when I tell you when I tell you all the furniture in the backyard was moved my dining chairs were stained my sofa was stained my rug was [\u00a0__\u00a0] broken I literally do not understand how someone could create so much tyranny and destruction in a house for four days actually no three days when the majority of the time that you should be [\u00a0__\u00a0] up you should be at a music festival [\u00a0__\u00a0] paintings were off the wall like paintings were off the wall I don't even like why would you even need to remove that what was the reason what was the reason Alaska stole pillows she stole like really nice pillows from the house she stole my pillows she broke my sliding glass door screen in two places she broke my new rug that rug was literally not even a month old like how do you do that it was honestly just a total mess and you know at the end of the day as much as it sucks to see my house blatantly disrespected like that um going into owning a house and putting it on Airbnb I already had to get rid of any attachment I had to anything in the house like I just you can't hold on I mean no let me let me be honest with you guys I'm not gonna lie there are things in the house that I do have sentimental attachment to but those are things that I strategically put in the house that are less likely to get [\u00a0__\u00a0] with you know a bed frame or you know like pictures like art that's a weird thing it's like art art you're gonna take the art off the walls okay so I'm editing the video right now and I just want to say when I was in the House filming the video I was noticing a bunch of stuff that was like off about the house but I didn't think anything of it I didn't feel like it was worth taking a picture of it like wasn't damaged or anything but now looking back I'm 100 certain that they had like a really bad shroom trip or like a bad LSD trip because everything is just pointing towards that one of the things that I thought was really odd about the house was in the backyard so there's like multiple areas to sit and hang out in the backyard there's the fire pit area with like comfortable couches there's a couch on the patio there's a couch facing the mountain there's four lounge chairs like there's plenty of seating in the backyard two dining tables so much seating there's even more than that and the seating is comfortable it's like soft couches one of the things that I thought was weird was the four chairs in the backyard like like upright iron kind of uncomfortable like wrought iron chairs they were like in this really weird seancy looking Circle and they were inside the bushes why would someone choose out of all the places in the house to comfortably sit with your friends why would they make a [\u00a0__\u00a0] witchcraft Circle where the chairs are so close together your knees are touching put the circle of chairs basically inside the bushes so you're getting your face is getting hit by like leave and at first I was like oh that's a really weird smoke circle like if they want to put the chairs together to like like smoke in a circle but then I'm like you have four people you could there's there's like full couches why would you why would you pick the like upright uncomfortable chairs and arrange them in that setting but anyway I thought that that was really weird and I feel like that's only someone that is on drugs would do that because you have nine seating you have nine couches and you choose like to put some chairs in a bush also all the art that was taken off the walls was like flower based but it's weird because in the house we have like a stone man statue with like a of a face and it's honestly kind of scary and we have this blue picture of this guy that's like honestly if you were on drugs it would be scary to look at and my mom and I decided that I think they were afraid to take it down I think they thought that it was watching them but the flowers they were okay to take down but they left like the faces I also thought that it was weird that they hid all of the lamps in the house like instead of just turning off the light they would like put lamps inside vases and like in the closets so gather without what you will yeah I mean at the end of the day my house was really disrespected and a rug being torn you know rugs can be replaced um food everywhere like that the house smelled like weed and this is the thing that I don't get the most okay I go to festivals I know how it is you know I get it like I've gotten blackout [\u00a0__\u00a0] drunk in a music festival I have taken way too many at a music festival I get it I get it I get doing your makeup in the bathroom and like being hungry because you haven't eaten all day so you're like simultaneously eating while doing your makeup like I I get it I respect it I'm here for it but here's the thing here's the thing the thing at least in my experience no matter how [\u00a0__\u00a0] up I get at a music festival no matter how cluttered and messy I make the bathrooms at the hotels that I stay at at the houses that I stay at when I'm getting ready no matter how much my makeup spreads across the counter no matter how Wild my life gets and my friend's life gets if we're staying at a house we respect it like it's not that hard is it really that hard to respect someone else's property is it really that difficult I did I wasn't aware that it was that difficult for people to just like how do you break a rug in three days all you have to do is just walk on it you just walk on it you just roll your suitcase over it how do you how do you break a rock I don't know what was going on there but [\u00a0__\u00a0] got crazy so anyway now I'm dealing with Airbnb trying to get reimbursed for all of the stuff that this girl broke in my house I'm trying to get reimbursed for the early check-in that she never paid for the pool heat that she never paid for all of which she agreed to in the messages um she never responded after she was kicked out of the house I never got in contact with her still to this day I don't know what got her kicked out of my house but this whole experience has been a learning experience I'm not going to say that I'm like traumatized by it I feel like you know this was bound to happen at some point it's just for it to be my second ever guest is pretty wild that I'm dealing with this but it comes with the territory like it comes with the territory okay so basically despite everything that happened Airbnb covered the booking so I still got paid for the reservation and at the end of the day Airbnb paid me around five thousand two hundred dollars for Alaska's booking I will keep you guys updated if I ever actually do get reimbursed for all the stuff that this chick broke in my house but yeah that is my Coachella Horror Story of Hosting my house on Airbnb would I do it again yes I will host my house on Airbnb next year I don't think this is going to ruin my perspective on hosting my house during festivals because at the end of the day I go to music festivals I know that I respect people's houses in people's hotels so hopefully I'll get a guess that's a little bit more like me next time but this isn't going to stop me from hosting my house to younger people which I know could stop a lot of older people from hosting their house to people my age this just gives people my age a bad reputation honestly but what can you do except for push on the moral of the story is not every guest is a good guest and I learned that and if Airbnb is a little sussed out by someone maybe I should be too also if you are putting your house on Airbnb please don't leave anything you have a personal sentimental attachment to in your house because you never know when you're gonna get a [\u00a0__\u00a0] Alaska who's gonna ruin everything I love you guys so much and I will see you guys next week for a new video bye [Music] thank you [Music]"

my Vlog Channel and you already know like the whole thing a lot of you guys on Instagram and all my Vlogs were like we need a slime warehouse and I was like you know what I think I'm gonna put this on my main Channel just because like I don't really upload that much on here anymore and I miss you guys and I was like let's just do a whole slime Warehouse tour girl I know some of you guys are thinking like because every time you guys come back to like this channel you stumble across my channel you're like hold on this girl's still making slime yes she is I will say you guys I don't know what happened from 2019 till today but slime is thriving more than ever right now I know that sounds crazy guys but you could ask any other slime shop they would tell you that right now the Slime shop world is doing incredible 2017-2016 around that time and I feel like that's when slime was like thriving like the viral videos online but right now with social media and just like Tick Tock slime has just came back stronger than ever in a different form we're just so so so grateful and thank you guys so much to everybody that has been supporting you guys are the best and you guys are the reason we are here today this is our homemade slime shop that we make like we're making this slime so thank you guys so much for tuning in and we're so excited we're so blessed and we're so happy that we're able to do this so without further Ado let's get in to show you the warehouse let's go [Music] so this room is really just like an office slash conference area Okay so this wall I just wanted to touch like a touch of color in the offices just because like how much can you really do like with offices especially like they're just like all white walls like they all kind of the same for this wall I actually ended up using Benjamin Moore which by the way thank you so much to Benjamin Moore for sponsoring this video I am so excited that I got to work with Benjamin Moore for this project because I was so excited to just decorate and paint and make this Warehouse hours first of all Benjamin Moore has over 3 500 Colors 3 500 colors girl and because they have their own formulas these colors cannot be replicated by other brands of paint we actually ended up testing out a few different colors we used this brand of Benjamin Moore this is the Color Rock Harbor Violet and I actually was leaning like towards a violet color because my daughter's middle name is Violetta which is violet in English I ended up testing different colors I wanted like pastel out colors but nothing too crazy since I couldn't decide I actually ended up ordering a few of their eight ounce samples from their e-store and the process was super simple and I received them in a few days which was perfect because we wanted to get this place up and running okay but seriously Benjamin Moore is the best paint I've ever used I don't paint a lot and it went out so so smooth I literally painted this wall almost myself Raul helped me set it up a little bit but because he was really busy with the rest of the warehouse and like organizing I literally painted this wall myself and it was so easy it only needed like not even like two full coats which most brands you would need several coats even but it covered it so freaking nicely I absolutely loved loved my Benjamin Moore I would highly highly recommend it to you guys so make sure that you guys check out Benjamin Moore's e-store to find your own paint samples and to find a local store near you on to the next room here is literally just a bathroom it's just about them that's it I took the bathroom it was also really important for me to have a space for my daughter Mia so that when she's here and when we're working that she feels like she is at home and not necessarily like at a warehouse so that's mostly why I wanted like some kind of office space it's a fun little area for the kids we actually like to hang out in here I want to put a TV in here like whenever we have like a break or something like maybe we want to come chill in here just like have a TV there's like a few things I want to add in this room but this is all we have going for now foreign okay inside the actual Warehouse in front of me right here we just have some shelving for slime so all these shows hold slime we actually just got a few more but we had most of these at the house it's crazy because they hold so much slime I mean a slime is about roughly this size so you can fit a lot seven slimes here just in this little corner I love these shelves because they're deep because they're pretty big in height like they're they have a lot of space they carry like so much weight and we're also thinking we're probably gonna add more depending on like if we see that we need more as you can see there is not many signs on the Shelf this is actually just slime that we usually leave aside we currently don't have anything in stock right now but for now they're empty basically to my left so there's more shows we got some supplies [Music] we have scents we have food coloring we have paint we have charms we have add-ins we have extras that we actually throw in orders sprinkles we have all kinds of add-ins I'll show you guys like the other side where like we have like more storage like where everything's kind of put away in boxes it just works you know we have the basics here but a lot of it is also like in boxed stored in boxes stored behind me are some like restaurant tables these are like the restaurant like uh metals or steel tables right yeah and these are perfect for slime if you see behind me this is the exciting part I can't wait to show you those back here you make the Slime and then up here you would bring the containers and we would pack it into actual like slime containers you know and having something like steel is good because it won't stick to the surface at all it's easy to clean and what I like underneath these they have like a shelf so that we could put the slime on there as well behind us we have a bunch of blue we just have these racks where we put glue gallons right next to the mixers so that we just grab them and their easy access right here these bad boys right here are industrial cake mixers people either use them for like baking people use them to make dough and people are usually fascinated with these just because like you're making slime and uh dough mixer and the reason we do that is because it would be so difficult by hand even making one gallon with your hands like it's a lot of kneading for the volume of slime that you need to make we definitely definitely need these cake mixers the mixers are an absolute need in the Slime shop this bad boy right here is our 140 quart mixer y'all this mixer alone holds more than all of those mixtures combined and that's all we had at the house this is what's gonna make us a lot of slime and I'm so excited because we would be like making slime night and day like all day in those and there was only so much you could physically make even if you're in the Slime room all day a huge reason why I want a warehouse as well is because this is like phase three like it takes up electricity that it didn't have at the house and that's why we needed like an industrial space that was like the one of the biggest reasons we got a warehouse because we needed industrial space to be able to have these big machines so these are the Slime makers to my right into my left we have some packing tables I got these packing tables we ended up getting four but we just combined two and two four people fit on these uh each so we could have eight people packing at once and I also have a bigger packing table that I'll show you guys over that one whether it's massive underneath there's space for boxes and like all the supplies that you need and honestly compared to what we were packing at home at home we were packing with like the regular like uh seven foot tables that were like low and like we were making it work with a few of those so these are gonna be great and I like how they're actually a little bit higher that way it's not like killing our back you know and to cool this Warehouse down follow me we have this big old fan y'all like it's it's pretty big we need it to be cool in here I read really great reviews about it and it should be cooling this space down perfectly so I'm so excited y'all because I freaking love it back here but it's hot this is the wall of shelves for storage but as you can see these are pretty tall like this is what's gonna hold a bunch of storage a bunch of containers extra glue extra supplies extra everything so we have everything lined up here if we need to get up on these stairs and get up here grab what you need and go more supplies this whole wand just has supplies and Behind These there is a whole other section like the other half to the warehouse basically and what I just showed you now is all the slime stuff like the Slime area behind us though my sister and I just launched a makeup line and that is also ran out of this Warehouse what are these called again powder Jack we got a pallet jack like for the pallets these are the palettes they're great to have when you have like all the orders you could just like stack them all up there and it's easier to transport them like to load them up also if we ever need to move something around you just put the palette down put a bunch of like product on it and then this guy right here will help you move it around the warehouse we have this packing table which is incredible this packing table right here is literally 12 feet wide and I don't know like what like four or five feet deep like it's so big this packing table literally is huge and I love it because you literally could fit like 12 people on just this packing table you can get four here easily like four to five four to five and in the corners as well you can literally fit like 10 people on just this table because it's so massive it also has wheels shout out to my friend Laura they were nice enough to sell me this table and I believe her dad made it so like it's extra big like they customized it you know it's like the biggest packing table I've ever seen it's amazing we just have more boxes there is also a bathroom back there [Music] and that is it for the warehouse you guys I think I showed you guys just about everything but a lot of you guys were asking for this tour so I hope you guys enjoyed I'm sorry if the lighting is like not the best this is the best site we can do like back here at the warehouse it's already night time as well we're gonna be restocking really soon follow me on Instagram I will update you guys on everything there thank you

like if I was meeting you in public and you're like hey I have a quick question uh how do you not paint your nails outside the line or how do you make your makeup not melt off your face like how do you how do you do these things like what do you do tati I wanted to know what interested you the most because I tend to have a lot of opinions about every single step of getting ready I've been doing this a very long time and you guys really went in and asked everything I was like wow I thought we were just gonna go with makeup but it's like all over the place in a really good way all right here we are I have some heartbreaking news for you guys first so let's just all take a deep breath okay let's collectively just be okay together all right one of the most reoccurring questions in this Roundup has to do with your sunglasses and how you don't get those little marks on your face and I'm going to toss the ball back to you honestly this happens to me even with my glasses if I put my glasses on in the morning for like 10 minutes I will have like the little dents like I am convinced from being a glasses wearer that I have like a misshapen nose or like it's like pinched a little up here like the bone is kind of weird from all of my many years from a little itty bitty baby like I literally was that baby that had like the the glasses that wrapped around the ear because she's been knocking into things for a long time I do not have great vision but anyway everyone was like Hey how do you wear sunglasses and not have it mess up your makeup and I'm like there is no no answer for this this is a dilemma that we are all stuck with I know that there are some people that are like you can put extra powder here or you can get like on Amazon like little cushion whatever thing no you cannot I've tried it it does not work if you have some secret you're holding back that we all need to know about leave it in the comments I want to know but I was laughing because like every five questions was that question and I'm like uh guys like how do I wake up with a full Glam done like you know like Mary Poppins wouldn't that be great right like a spoonful of sugar and she's like snapping and you're just like liner lips lashes okay you know this first question I'm just gonna go ahead and say thank you uh the question is coming from Krista b2396 she says how to be as beautiful as you when I get older you've just made my day I honestly have not had the best month as far as just like getting frustrated with like a breakout or um lines popping up and just like you know without all the lights and the makeup and all of it I deal with insecurities and you know all the same junk that many of us go through I'm gonna use this opportunity to plug a product of mine that is sitting right here right at the front of this video just because I don't talk about this enough and it really is an incredible formula this is the Sakura anti-aging booster from Halo Beauty we just dropped

Applause moment and also what a nice comment you know I was telling James the other day and I actually got really emotional and totally teary-eyed I was like I for years was not able to go in the comment section without someone kind of laying eyes first because it was so triggering to me and you can think what you want about that it was so bad for a while that I just couldn't do it because one comment telling me that I was you know XYZ would just put me in such a funk and it got so hard to get out of the funk and I have to say that now oh I'm in the comments all the time like right when the video goes live it is fun for me I am hearting things I'm replying to you guys and it's me it's not my I don't have an assistant it's me I don't have an assistant I'm the one responding to DMS and your comments so I see what you guys leave me and I just want to say you are the best and you make me feel very loved and confident to sit down and do what I do so thank you so much it really means the world um okay we're gonna get right into it the best way to tame frizzy hair staticky hair now this is an old school tip of mine but I think we need to bring it back I'm having a little bit of an issue myself hello humidity in Texas so my really off the wall tip for this is to go and buy fabric sheets I'm all about using the wool balls in my actual dryer so we're not going and picking them up for our clothes I find that film and the fragrance is a mess for me on my clothes my clothes just have been staying nicer longer with just like the wool balls to get rid of static on your clothes but if you're in a pinch if nothing is making the frizz go away and your hair is doing that like what kind of a thing I am telling you rub dryer sheets in the hair it will get rid of it in a snap Kerastase makes some that are formulated from whatever that means for the hair it's like the same thing except for you're gonna pay like forty dollars so no Bam Bam don't do that go to the dollar store get a cheap box of fabric softener sheets rub it on your hair and thank me later Emma hello 16. okay how to not have shaky eyeliner now I I'm assuming you're lit like we go oh my gosh we had coffee we had coffee danger danger I'm on a water kick right now I'm very proud of it okay so if you have the shaky hands for whatever reason what I recommend is anchoring what you want to do find a table you want to put your elbow down this sounds like a silly little tip but a lot of us will try to do winged liner like this like oh my gosh ah right no anchor here take your liner tilt and then because if you have your elbow on the table not moving your hand even if you're shaky is going to have a smoother follow through I also recommend do not go back and forth try your very best to go on the inner and glide and then go and add more and glide and anchor your elbow that also works for mascara application lash application lean into the mirror bam these are like maybe the dumbest tips ever but at least they'll be new and fresh for you guys right this is the stuff that I do okay how to best conceal scars I am going to link below one of my favorite heavy duty will cover a tattoo incredible concealers it is technically a foundation I did a video on it way back when the I'm not really proud of I don't think it looked good as Foundation but through the years I have kept it on hand it's by dermacol they have many different shades and it is like a pro concealer I would say if you have some kind of hyperpigmentation or something you really want to conceal go for that maximum almost professional concealer to keep on hand I love having a concealer the that matches my skin that matches my Foundation I have also gone to Great Lengths to match exactly my Foundation to concealer if you're going into Sephora if you're going even into the drugstore I will actually take like imagine this is an empty small container I will put my foundation in there so that I can actually see my Foundation next to whatever concealer I'm swatching and try to get the exact match that way you can do your foundation and keep it quite sheer if you choose to but if you have an area that needs that Precision concealing and you want a thicker formula you have the same shade and it's undetectable I love that technique I use dermacol for that technique Nars makes a great full coverage concealer that works well on the face in my opinion uh Makeup Forever has some nice ones as well someone says this might be silly but any beauty tips for feeling more beautiful in a bathing suit that's not silly at all I personally don't like how I look in a bathing suit I joke around about it all the time that I feel like I am just like a lifelong member of the pancake booty club I'm doing my Pilates and I am seeing some success which is like amazing but it's like not my strong part so I hear you we all want to look great in our swimsuit feel confident I have three things that always make me feel really beautiful when I'm gonna be out poolside one is some kind of a long like it doesn't have to be long but like a cute little cover-up like a chiffoni kind of get dramatic with it do some kind of it almost looks like a dressing gown kind of a Vibe I have a couple of them that I've picked up at Target they're my favorite things to kind of you know conceal the back of the legs if that's an insecure spot for you if not bless you but I always like kind of a little bit of like a see-through fabric I also think for some reason I don't know why but I Feel So Glamorous in a hat and I feel like it's also protecting my face a little bit from like squinting and like the sun you know obviously a Hat's not gonna be your SPF but I love like a fun floppy hat summertime and then do not underestimate the power of just caring for your skin head to toe and that's going to happen daily use a good moisturizer the texture of your skin is such like a sign of health and vibrancy and just like the elasticity and the bounciness of it and the plushness and juiciness of it just head to toe whatever your body shape is going to be more confidence boosting in my opinion than anything else so take care of your skin dry brush I will link below an ancient video on that I still do that for lymphatic drainage and to get dead skin off I just think it boosts circulation it feels really good and my skin is always so smooth afterward and then make sure that you are using lotion after every shower even if you really don't want to because hi I don't want to I feel like oh sticky greasy gross but I'm still on the notorium kick I love that lotion so much it's unscented and it leaves like I'm wearing it today I'm not wearing any body makeup like glowy anything and it just makes the skin kind of have this nice like shine um so find a lotion that you enjoy using be consistent with it try dry brushing throw on a hat throw on a cute little dressing gown swim cover up and go live your best what order to do skin care I love this question because I am so that person that I'm like step one to step 10 and like I will write it in my journal and I'm such a nerd like that so I'm gonna say double cleanse if you wear makeup like me if you got all this going on you need to take it off properly use a balm cleanser an oil cleanser that is step one step two cleanse whether you are then going in with a water cleanser micellar water or an actual double cleanser which is what I typically do that is step two step three you're going to want to do an essence if you're extra if you're extra do an Essence if you're not skip it but I do like at the end of the night that hole just Just Bounce some juiciness into the skin it's not a toner that you're like wiping off you're actually taking it in your hands okay so after an essence you can tone and then serum and then I like to do eye cream before I go in with a cream if I am feeling extra which I usually am I will then take an oil and I will slick it all in and I will wake up feeling Juiced hydrated ready for another day of makeup and that is my nighttime routine oh you know what else is good that I've been loving I've been loving this is like I don't know why they work because when I use these consistently my 11s They Don't disappear but they soften so much so I have been big time into tape talks and then I use it as a guide for my eyeliner eyeshadow and then another question on here is how do you remove glitter that has fallen from your eyeshadow off of your face now you want to not go in with like a brush that's really not going to do anything except for move around your other makeup and if you start picking with your nail you might Dent or scratch your makeup or irritate your skin I have an option if you don't have these guys you can use magic tape not regular Scotch tape if you have regular Scotch tape make sure you kind of Pat off some of the stickiness off the back of your hand first but what I have done and I did this like you know I with tati Beauty there was a lot of glitter and sometimes it would get in places I didn't want it and like ruin a shot so if you take any kind of tape sticker what have you and you literally just go like that the glitter will stick to the sticky part and problem is solved go back in with a little powder and you're good someone says how do you get rid of or prevent blackheads now I am crazy about my skin we know this I look in a magnifying mirror and I probably shouldn't I would say warning don't do what I do I get really geeked out when there are too many blackheads on my nose or on my cheeks and there are times where we just can't resist picking at our face which is not recommended and every dermatologist is like don't do that but if you're gonna do it make sure your face is clean your hands are clean and that uh perhaps you have come out of a steamy shower or you can steam your face that will help if you are trying to manually get rid of a blackhead but what I would recommend overall is at least you know twice a week maybe three times a week depending on how sensitive your skin is use some type of an exfoliant I have hopped on The Tick Tock train and I am into the Paula's Choice exfoliant toner and I feel like it is doing good things for my skin now to squeeze that into my nighttime routine that would be my step before serum so I would Essence let that really soak in and then my toner would be an exfoliating toner I don't use that every night it's a little bit of an intense product so you kind of have to gauge what is good for your skin they're also you know manual exfoliators are good of course you want to go with something gentle not like the apricot scrub or anything like that I also still love using an exfoliating cotton round I find like just the gentle exfoliation if I'm getting makeup off the side of the nose does help keep things really clear but also make sure you're properly removing your makeup I know that that sounds like a no-brainer but a lot of us we wash our face and we think we can go in for 20 seconds and the skin is clean no you really want to count to like 6 D and actually take your fingertips and really get in those areas where you're seeing clogged pores go on the chin for an extra second or two go on the side of the nose make sure everything is rinsed clean and that you don't have bacteria and makeup clogging up the pore with dead skin creating a potential issue recently I've been using those micro patches that have like it's not actual needles in the micro patch but there's something to them that actually I don't know what it is you wake up in the morning and like problem solved it kind of left me a little bit speechless um but yeah they're good someone says do you have a clean-ish body oil to recommend thanks tati uh go check out my Amazon must-haves Coco Solus is the brand this is like the coolest thing also this is like an oil balmy I don't even know what you would call this but it's like one of these you can put on the body I don't know it's like what is this this is hundred percent pure organic coconut oil but it also has a little bit of a bronze Mica situation in here and you can take a brush with it and just literally like are you kidding me it's beautiful I love this stuff I keep it on my vanity this brand as far as their body products they are a plus gorgeous really high quality organic ingredients and if you're looking for a clean Body Oil that's what I would recommend this one says Wing eyeliner I don't really know what that means use the guard um let's see here someone says how do you carve out a jawline correctly let me give you a brief re-education on this one now a lot of people they kind of go too high in my opinion where they put the Contour actually on the face no you know what I'm gonna just I'm just gonna go in and exaggerate the Contour so you guys can see all right I'm going in with my rcma you want the shadow to be underneath the jaw let's maybe do one side and compare to the other so what I do then is I kind of blend whatever I've put underneath my jawline down and I typically will do this before I do my foundation and then when you go in with your foundation get a little bit on the neck because we want the face and the neck to match and then just kind of go up a little bit you're going to cover up any harshness with that line but can you see I hope you can see this side just has a little more of a sharpness than this side so it's subtle which we want you don't want people to be like oh my gosh like look at those stripes underneath her jaw Contour is creating an optical illusion so you just want to give a little bit of an extra shadow that actually isn't there but you're kind of tricking the eye that there is that shadow giving that sharpness right here you know what I'm saying let me just finish up the other side let's even her out also another tip with this don't do that do you want to put the Contour how you actually hold your head so how you are actually going to look in real life because no one walks around with their chin up to the sky so what you want to do is see how you're actually going to look someone says how do you remove face hair I have a dermaplaner but honestly back in the day I would just use a razor and some caution um yeah it it happens to the best of us okay someone says tati how do you care for your nails what tools and products do you use not just polish I don't use anything super crazy I'm Still Loving Olive and June Picante this has been the longest wearing polish for me it's their fast dry formula I liked it because it matched well actually I picked out this shirt because it matched my nails sales so let's start there I have been into painting my own Nails you guys know I love the cutex dip to remove the Polish really quickly but the other thing that I really love is uh sashvi top coat that will make it's toxic let's we're gonna have to jump over that um that ledge whatever open a window when you use it it's crazy but in my mind I'm like better than sitting in the salon for two hours and spending tons of money and it's kind of like ah we're just gonna get over it sash meat is an amazing fast dry top coat it's so thick that it totally makes the nails look like you had a gel manicure so that is a must I love using a ridge filler for my base I'm really into the orally one right now or any kind of base coat I know that's a step that's not very fun and a lot of us are like skip it go straight in you will stain your nails and I think it's just good practice to do that base coat I usually have a YouTube video or something on at my desk and all I'll just watch and I'll give myself like five minutes and then I'll go in with that color coat and give it like a few minutes to dry go in again and then put that fast dry top coat on and it does dry super fast what I also love doing is the little cutex jars that I use to remove my nail polish I will actually take an angled brush now you can purchase an actual nail brush if you like you know I'm sure at Sally's Beauty Supply but you can get like cheapy little even disposable brushes I will link some below or you can take an old eyeliner brush you're not using it anymore just make sure you put it with your nail stuff so that you don't get confused but I love letting my nails completely dry and then going in and just over the cuticle area and any like spillage over the sides I will just dip into the remover and kind of clean up the edges the other thing that I still do you guys this was like a proud moment in the history three of my channel I really felt like a celebrity and like I had made it because my nail Beauty tip had made it into a lore magazine I still use this very beloved technique and it is to not paint your thumbs until the very last so if you're painting and you are like me and you're like oh gosh darn it and you like get outside the edges and you're just like having a meltdown over it keep the thumbs open clear because they're gonna be your sharp clean up the edges tool I dip into my cutex remover and I will go on the edge and just bam bam I will clean up those edges clean up those edges I will put a really cheesy tip Tuesday which is like two minutes or less I'll try to find that video and Link it but I'm telling you that is a game changing technique if you are like me and you are wobbly about um painting like the anchoring is not going to work for shaky hands with painting your nails but using your thumbs as the cleaner uppers does work and then you have to paint your thumbs really carefully you just like hold your breath or something oh you know what a lot of people were asking how to get rid of lines under the eyes all right yeah this is serious stuff how do we prevent creasing underneath the eyes if you are someone that has Fine Lines what you want to make sure first off is that you are using a good eye cream you don't want to be using a ton of powder on like terribly dry under eyes to begin with like that's just not it's not going to work so you want there to be enough emollient going on underneath the eyes I really enjoy using the Ula Henriksen either the CC Bright Stick which is this guy someone in the comments was like stop talking about Oola and I'm like never will never happen um or use the eye cream as kind of your primer for underneath the eye I do find that helps minimize creasing okay you're going in with your concealer less is more you don't need to completely paint away everything underneath the eye so you can layer more later if you need more add more but less is more go on the inner corner where that darkness is strongest and make sure you are patting your creases out before you go in with powder I always say that but if you're doing your foundation or you're smiling and talking and you have lines the last thing you want to do is go in with a powder and set a line because then game over it's going to be there there's no one doing that you've just set a line so what I always do and you see me in tutorials or get ready with me's I always kind of go like this I used to joke with Erica I'm like alien face and like we'd both be like um but we knew what we were doing like there was intention there and so I got this so attractive and Pat out those creases and then you go in with your powder now if you are high maintenance you have an event where you're like I need these under eyes to be perfect you don't want to look crinkly or wrinkly or lining you want it to be smooth and how you're going to get there is use a powder with some silica in it that tends to kind of fill in those lines and kind of somehow like Cinderella's glass slipper like you're going to wash your face those lines are going to be there but it will kind of give you a bit of a fill and then go in with your brightening powder don't just use a brightening powder and think that that's going to really have the ingredients all the time that are going to fill in the lines so you want something that is like poor blurring like look for that word on a powder pore blurring or like diffuses and just lightly go underneath the eye first after you've patted away your creases then use another brightener on top game changed and while your powder is kind of setting this is just a me thing I try to not emote too much until I'm done with my makeup and I've like sprayed and set and everything I want it to warm to the skin without me you know and like makeup's really while it's just warming up to the skin like sinking into the creases I don't know if there's anything to prove that that's helpful but that is what I do and then on the go do take like a little Powder Puff with you and whatever excess is on here is usually enough you don't even need to bring another powder with you and throughout the day if you see those creases if you have a line right here just kind of stretch it out no big deal no big deal we're good we're fresh and there you have it I think I have chatted your ear off I have answered a lot of questions if you guys want me to do a part two to this because there were so many questions like usually you guys when I ask about my life like it's a lot of the same questions but you guys like really went in and we could talk about liner and falsies and mascara and lipstick and just all the detail little tricks and tips so keep your questions coming let me know if you want more like this make sure you are subscribed and ring the bell before you leave go have a good one whatever you are doing I love you all so much and I will see you guys in my next video foreign"

being here [Music] all right [Music] it's very important small for Miami you need like that big buttons the most casual outfit I've been playing in a while yeah it's gonna be warm and uh might be cold all right one thousand one tractors here we go [Music] [Music] what's happening I'm seeing that Alan is getting sunburned he didn't want to put on the uh yeah he's gonna taste his own medicine oh it's very cool you're not burnt no in three times let's do it baby we're just gonna do it we're gonna do it right here I got microphone I know that you have an upcoming release and by the way by the time you guys watch this it might already be out I feel like that song kind of brings you back to your original sound a little bit right do you feel that way when you made it for me it's really important to kind of develop my sound but also stay true to myself like very very early on when I started making music my dad came to me and he was like hey you need to have like a signature sound that's what I did when I started off and I've been trying to integrate that in the newer songs keeping the Melodies there and having them like melancholic and uplifting and catchy okay yeah thank you we found a photo of you meeting Bill the owner of us yeah I run down and I was like 16 so 16 17. did they flew you over no if you came to Bergen how would we like to meet you I guess he saw the potential at that time already yeah I'm not sure I don't think he's doing that with every yard will fade for example he did everyone rejected it yeah well I had no idea how to pitch at the measure levels they're only like nearby like a like another level which was a significantly smaller something like a ballet bridged out and it was like yo we want to sign like Fade to NCS through Facebook yeah to just like uh I've been trying I tried to like reach out to NCS for a while but again with no success and then eventually they just reset to you and the crazy story nobody wanted to everybody yeah yeah that's the beauty of it though that was like my dream level it wasn't like my dream to go to like Sony Universal learner whatever it was like always empty us and why was it your dream because everybody else wanted to answer us and I saw like kids be potential like in growth of the songs on the Internet or like and I really really believe in in like letting YouTubers Catholic Critters streamers actually have permission to use the songs like rather than like a striking or using the songs because I think one of the main reasons why for example the Specter has one billion streams on YouTube is because we had it as a copyright free song and allowed people to use it on their videos absolutely we have a great record coming up where we could you know see the potential again right yeah of defining Rick to the creators in this community and why do you think that your records just blew up that heavily as in as they did compared to the young NCS records I don't know I think the Simplicity they're catching us on the sound I've always believed that like a song doesn't have to be complicated to be good and that's what I have been trying to implement in the songs that we've been doing now and also they're like like even though like it's maybe not the most trendy sound but like it's really it's a sound that fascinates with me and what I think 100 song over it puts close to your heart as well 93.5 FM yeah hi hi Alan I'm Stefano thanks for coming wow the radio station is uh really engaged into saving animals we rescue both of them and we do this kind of Activation so we try to stimulate the audience into this kind of uh Radio City no we are engaged with clean this beach up which is an association for the environment it's called clean this yeah yeah  or what are we cleaning here and don't don't use it again in this beach we're in Miami of course but CTS was already here yes David Guetta is here great amazing big artists from over across the group and I wish I could have told me more

   "Ne-Yo": {
      "name": "Ne-Yo",
      "corpus": "- I learned very early on that one of the more passionate genres of music was R&B. R&B is basically melodic passion. (upbeat music) I realized that it was gonna be music for me at nine years old. I grew up in a house with my mother, my sister, my grandmother, five aunts, and me. But my mom, you know, blue collar mom, just making sure that the kids was all right, she worked every casino, pretty much every position in the casino that you could work. Every night, she would bring home a different kind of music for me and her to sit around and listen to, you know? Initially, it was a lot of R&B, a lot of Motown and stuff like that, but then she started bringing home, like, Wayne Newton and the Rat Pack, Tom Jones and stuff like that. And that kind of fueled my love for melody as opposed to just music. I'm living in this house with all of these women, and I'm writing in a journal because initially, I was kind of an angry little kid. Dad wasn't around, uncles come and go real quick. As I'm growing up, becoming a young man, I don't really have anybody to bounce these emotions off of. I needed an outlet, and initially, I started doing really, really stupid stuff, breaking windows, just something to get it off me, whatever it was. My mom gave me the notebook, the red notebook, and she said, \"Write it down.\" And I said, \"Write what down?\" And she said, \"I don't care, just write it down. Whatever it is you're feeling, whatever it is going on in there, write it down there.\" The breaking point, I don't remember what I was upset about, but I was really, really mad at something, and I ran in my room and I slammed the door and I grabbed my notebook. Initially, I was writing words, but then after a while, it just kind of became (snarls). Just trying to get that off of me, you know? And what I realized after I was done is that I didn't feel those emotions anymore. Whatever it is that was bothering me, it wasn't bothering me anymore because it wasn't inside anymore, it was on a page now. From journal entries to poetry to songs, that was kind of the transition for me. In an R&B song, it was okay for a man to cry. In an R&B song, it was okay for a man to show weakness. Like, it was all right to be vulnerable in R&B if you did it right and if you did it from the heart. My five kings are Prince, Stevie, Marvin, Michael, Sammy David Jr. These five men are the five that, you know, if you can meld them into one person, that's what I've been trying to accomplish my whole career. It was actually a friend of mine in school that told me that music is something that you could actually do as a career. Like, you could grow up and be a guy that just does music and people give you money for it. And I was like, \"Word? Oh, okay, well I found my career. That's what I'm doing. Yeah, sign me up now. I'm in, I'm in.\" And I never looked back. Mario's \"Let Me Love You\" was my first number one. It's the first number one song that I had ever written. Which was weird for me because I had, like, the number one song on the radio, but nobody knew who the hell I was. Like, I could walk up down the street and not be bothered by anybody, which honestly, was kind of cool. You see cars rolling by and they blaring it loud, and I'm like, \"I wrote that, yeah, that's me.\" \u266a Baby, I just don't get it \u266a \u266a Do you enjoy being hurt \u266a \u266a I know you smell the perfume \u266a \u266a The makeup on his shirt \u266a \u266a You don't believe his stories \u266a \u266a You know that they're all lies \u266a \u266a Bad as you are, you stick around \u266a \u266a And I just don't know why \u266a - I dug that part of being a songwriter, the freedom to still be a regular person, while at the same time, music is still your profession. After that song came out and did what it did, for a long time, I didn't have a name. I was, \"Oh, yeah, you the kid that wrote the Mario song.\" That was my name. That's what everybody... \"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, the kid that wrote the Mario song. Hey, hey, go call the kid that wrote the Mario song.\" And I answered to it proudly, like, \"Yep, yep, that's me, I did that, that was me.\" That song got me the attention of a lot of different people, L.A. Reid and Jay-Z, for example, which would eventually become the record deal that would introduce Ne-Yo to the world. (gentle music) When we first started putting together my first album, at this point, I have the Mario record and everybody knows that I can write a hit for other people. So now the question became, can he do it for himself? So there was a little bit of pressure, but I say a little bit because I wasn't really letting it bother me. I was just so happy to be in the position that I was in. It's like, yo, I am really sitting in a room right now, surrounded by people that are dedicated to helping me produce my first album. This is a dream come true. This is what I've wanted since I was nine years old. Like, I'm here, and I was very much aware of what it was in the moment. We wasn't concerning ourselves with genre, we wasn't concerning ourselves with where we was gonna land, we was just jumping, just because we was just enjoying what we was doing. I genuinely feel like when you listen to that album, you can kind of hear the joy that everybody was feeling as we was putting these records together. Like, it just felt, everything just felt right. I don't know if you've ever been in that place in life where, and it doesn't have to be major, but where for whatever reason, everything just kind of fell in line on that day. Like, I had a, like, full four months of that. When I first met Stargate, if you know, you know. Two tall, lanky white dudes from Norway. And I must admit, I definitely walked in the room and judged a book by its cover. I was like, there's no R&B happening here. The very first track they ever played me was the music that we now know as \"So Sick\". (\"So Sick\") I let them get about 15 seconds through and I was like, \"Wait, wait, wait, wait, run that back.\" Played it again. \u266a Ding, ding, ding, ding \u266a Somebody got a pen? \u266a Ooh \u266a \u266a Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo \u266a \u266a Gotta change my answering machine \u266a \u266a Now that I'm alone \u266a \u266a 'Cause right now, it says that we \u266a \u266a Can't come to the phone \u266a \u266a And I know it makes no sense \u266a \u266a 'Cause you walked out the door \u266a \u266a But it's the only way I hear \u266a \"So Sick\" is about the first time that I ever truly, truly fell in love. At that point in my life, when the story took place, I maybe might have been 15, maybe 16, somewhere in there. I had said I love you before. Well, I'm not proud of it, we all grow from somewhere, but at one point, if that meant me getting what I want, I would say it. Just kind of was what it was. I know I'm not alone. Anyway. (laughs) \u266a Cryin' over you \u266a \u266a And I'm so sick of love songs \u266a \u266a So tired of tears \u266a \u266a So done with wishing \u266a With this particular girl in this particular time, it was real, I actually meant it, I really did love her. But the problem was, when it's a group of friends, one guy in the group gets a girlfriend, so now he's spending all the time with the girlfriend and not hanging out with the crew anymore. Yeah, I was that guy. My friends would call like, \"Hey, your girl gonna let you out the house tonight?\" You know, like stupid stuff like that. And me being just young and young minded, I let it get to me, I let that start bothering me to the point where I started treating her poorly. \u266a And your memory \u266a \u266a And how every song reminds me of what used to be \u266a She wasn't with that, she left, and I didn't realize the stupid thing that I had done until she was gone, which is kind of the way of all things. Like, you don't realize what you had until it's gone. I kid you not, at the time, no matter where I was at, no matter what station we put on on the radio, there was always a sad-ass slow song playing that would just take me back to the fact that you just lost somebody that you genuinely and truly cared about behind pride and ego. That song poured outta me in probably about three minutes. It might be the fastest song I've ever written. (\"Sexy Love\") \"Sexy Love\", kind of to a degree written about the same girl. She kind of had a hold on me. She did. I will admit, she kind of had a hold on me. I just remember that whenever she would breathe right here, that I would get, like, these chills, these goosebumps, and like, it would make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I listen to the track that they're playing and I just keep getting thrown back into these memories of that relationship, and you know, the good stuff when it was good, and the line just came to me. \u266a She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up \u266a \u266a Just one touch \u266a The day the album came out (laughs), I remember waking up and throwing up, like, right away, like (groans). When the first numbers came in and they told me I did, like, 370 first week, 370,000 copies first week, (sighs) okay, okay, they like it. We good. From my first album debuting at number one, moving on up the line in time to winning my first Grammy, meeting the president, performing at the White House multiple times, it took a good 10 years for me to, like, sit still long enough to realize what we had actually done. Once the ball started rolling, we didn't stop. We was on a roll for like two years straight at one point. Like, we just didn't stop. We didn't even really have the time to sit and celebrate and kind of bask in it in the moment because things just kept moving, and we liked it that way. \u266a I sit up all night thinkin' bout ya \u266a \u266a And I know it ain't right, baby, but I don't \u266a \u266a I don't think that I, don't think I can let go \u266a \u266a Don't think I can let you go \u266a There is power in music. There is world-changing, life-changing, lifesaving power in music, and when you realize that, you kind of can't look at it the way you did anymore, you can't unknow it. You have to kind of lock into that responsibility now. I've done everything in my power to maintain my normalcy because I've seen what happens when you allow yourself to buy all the way in to the smoke and mirrors and the glitz and glamour and the fantasy that is the music industry. And I told myself this at a very, very young age, very early in my career, no matter how big I get, I will always be a regular damn person. I have to lock into the truth, which is I'm no better than anybody else. If you can keep that right here as all of the fantasy and glitz and glamour is happening around you, you might be all right. If you ever lose sight of that, we've seen what can happen. Can't have that happen to me, especially now I got kids. I got people that's depending on me. I've circled the globe three, four times at this point. I've been a little bit everywhere, done a little bit of everything, and I can honestly say the most fulfilling thing that I've ever done is be a father. It is the greatest thing I've ever done. Being a parent will teach you patience. It'll teach you humility. It'll teach you the importance of time. If you haven't latched onto that yet, how valuable time is, spend 10 minutes with your kid just doing something silly. As long as he's laughing and having a good time, you've done your part as a parent. Like, don't beat yourself up because you don't get to spend all day with your kids. Who spends all day with their kids? Well, maybe now, 'cause this whole pandemic thing. I don't care about fame, none of that stuff means anything to me anymore. I want you to go get it because I need to feed my kids. That's why I want you to go get it now. That's the most important thing now. That is the focal point of life. (gentle music) (child babbling) - Cut, cut, baby girl. (gentle music) What it is to be a Black man in America is to be in a foot race with a bunch of other people, and for whatever reason, you have on a backpack full of bricks, shackles on both feet, handcuffs, and a person with a gun on your heels, and you gotta run this race same as everybody else with all of these things attached to you, with all of these things making it that much harder for you to get anywhere. You have to be that much better, that much smarter, that much faster, whatever the case may be. In order to get ahead in this life, you have to be excellent pretty much at all times. Your excellence has to hide the fact that you're Black to some of these people. Okay, he's Black, but he's really smart. Okay, yeah, he's Black, but damn, he can shoot that basketball. Yeah, he's Black, but ooh, did you hear that song? Black men are definitely a target. It's an accomplishment for a Black man to get old enough for somebody to call him old. Somebody called me old the other day and I said, \"Thank you.\" Damn right, 41. If 41 is old, then I'll be old all day long, because I know cats younger than me that ain't here no more. We say Black Lives Matter. We didn't say white lives don't matter. We didn't say Black Lives Matter more. We just said Black Lives Matter. That just means we matter too. George Floyd was not the first Black man to be killed by police on camera. What made this so special is that the world slowed down and everybody had no choice but to look and see what is happening here. You couldn't unsee that. You couldn't ignore that. \u266a How do I sing \u266a - I got the privilege to sing for the family at George Floyd's funeral. They asked me to sing. They didn't tell me what to sing. They said, \"Just choose something that you feel like is appropriate for the moment.\" So I got up there and I sang \"It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday.\" \u266a I thought we'd get to see forever \u266a \u266a But forever's gone away \u266a - As I was walking off stage, his brother stopped me and said, \"Bro, I don't know if you knew, that was one of George's favorite records. That was one of his favorite songs, period.\" \u266a And I'll take with me the memories \u266a \u266a To be my sunshine after the rain \u266a \u266a It's so hard to say goodbye \u266a \u266a To yesterday \u266a - The only way for you to fail is to just not do anything. (upbeat music) All the tools are right there in your face. You just gotta dedicate the time to it and be patient enough to let it happen the way it's gonna happen. I have been working on a brand new album that will be out this year. Concept of this album is basically just an escape from the screwy and crummy reality that is right now. I feel like we didn't need another record reminding us that things are fucked up right now. I don't need to remind you of that in a colorful song. I don't need to do that for you. You can turn on the TV and see that. You can look out your window and see that. What you do need is a moment to inhale and exhale. This album is an hour and 40 minutes roughly of breathe, get away from the stresses and dramas of your life for just this long, let it re-energize you so that you can walk back out into that storm and do what it is you gotta do. That's what this album is. Music is a part of who I am, literally, physically, it's part of who I am, so I will always do music that will always be, and any other mediums that I can lend myself to and do right by, you'll see me there too. So I'm gonna say what I always say, keep your eyes to the sky, ears to the ground, you will hear me, see me, I will be around always. \u266a Pure seduction in her eyes \u266a \u266a I've heard story after story, no surprise \u266a"

      "corpus": "got a warm welcome to this talk it's Sunday the 30th of April now today's studies really quite impressively uh interesting it's about cannabis now most of you will probably know in cannabis there's two main ingredients there's the THC the tetrahydrocannabine oh that's the bit that gets you high if you use this substance and there's the other one the CBD the cannabidiol which is very much none uh psychotropic it doesn't affect the brain at all now I'm going to give evidence today that the CBD the cannabidiol seems to have and there's pretty good evidence from this study and other studies antiviral properties now we'll be looking at evidence that it uh reduces the infection from SARS coronavirus too and helps with the illness and we'll be looking at evidence that it helps with another RNA virus hepatitis C now let me tell you what evidence I'm going to be considering and you can decide if you want to watch this video this is oral by the way it's not injections and in all cases it's been completely non-toxic at the doses that have been described now the first line of evidence that this works against SARS coronavirus 2 and probably other viruses but the researchers on SARS coronavirus too is in human lung cell cultures where it prevented infection when the cells were infected if they'd been exposed to the to the cannabidiol two hours before it essentially prevented all of the infection but it didn't work with THC so this means that if people are smoking cannabis or using cannabis products that are mixed with CBD and THC the ones that will get you high it won't work this is strictly the non-psychotropic version tetrahydrocan are being all inhibited the effect of the cannabidiol in terms of antiviral properties so that's the first one human cell cultures the second evidence is from mice so it actually works in animals infected mice they were given CBD cannabidiol twice a day for four days and they had 40 times less viral particles in their lungs really quite impressive and the third line of evidence is human now in the United States they managed to recruit 1221 people that are on cannabidiol to prevent epilepsy and they found that they were 50 less likely to get infected with SARS coronavirus II and they had no follow-up on whether they got sicker or not but it would be likely that these people didn't get uh sick as their counterparts may have done it especially with the early versions of SARS coronavirus too so three impressive lines of evidence we're going to look at probably works against appetite to see some evidence for that terrible disease hepatitis C could well work against colds flu Ebola mumps and measles the reason I'm saying that is purely because they're other RNA viruses we don't know but it could potentially work against that so I would certainly call for uh um immediate research to be done on this but of course hemp plants which is where this essentially comes from can be grown up by the hectare and uh hemp oil the cannabidiol can be produced for essentially nothing and it can be produced by anyone it's not a it's not a specific preparation so again because any producer who meets basic food manufacturing requirements could set up and produce this it's unlikely that big Pharma are going to do the clinical trials so this could be another one of those uh potentially brilliant treatments that's going to be completely lost to humanity because there's no money in it and I'm going to stop there otherwise I'll get crossed let's let's go back and look at the evidence now that's what this video is about so this is the original paper here cannabidiol inhibits SARS coronavirus II replication and promotes host innate immune response now this was a preprint so I did come across this I think last year but I decided not to take it up but now it's uh it's fully peer-reviewed so we now have the evidence in hand and well um it's taken me a while to read through this paper it really is quite an impressive piece of work very biochemical I had to look up a few other words I must confess um but so this is my understanding of the paper but I think I think I've got the the main points uh fairly accurately uh cannabidiol potential regulator of the host stress so this is the the way that the body responds or the cells respond to viral infection and it also looks like it is it um it uh it helps antiviral inflammatory responses now there was two things here first of all it helped the beneficial inflammatory response which is what you need as part of the immune response but also it inhibited the release of the cytokines which causes the cytokine storm so it looks like we're getting the benefits of the immunity but inhibiting the cytokine storm so it really is a win-win uh preparation according to the evidence cited in this study um kind of bedial class of natural products so it's a natural product natural products of course are great there's all sorts of natural products let's think of some for example opium is a natural product from opium poppies antibiotics are a natural product from molds the very the the a lot of the best Therapeutics come from natural products um others we could mention um it's a normal solution so that's good now hemp hemp plants contain less than 0.3 percent uh THC tetrahydrocannabino so um but we'll show that this preparation was actually uh fairly pure um CBD oral solution is already FDA approved so given that this is FDA approved and it exists um there's no reason why in theory doctors shouldn't be allowed to prescribe it it would be off license for this product because it's only licensed for epilepsy at the moment or various types of fitting and as I say the large-scale clinical trials probably won't be done but they should be done High purity CBD inhibits SARS coronavirus 2 replication in human lung epithelial cells so this is human cell lines that they're taking cells that were taken from humans have been bred up in cultures and they're able to do experiments on these in my view this is quite ethical research it's actually human cells taken from people who had lung cancer is where they got it from so the pre-treated human cells with CBD and these are with the ace receptor for two hours so the pre-treated with CBD for two hours CBD potentially inhibited viral replication under non-toxic conditions so the doses here that they used if you scaled this dose up to the uh the whole person that they were none toxic doses and CBD is a safe preparation anyway well safest you can never say it's completely safe but it's it's basically safe you can certainly buy it in supermarkets in the UK for example worked in other human cell lines so they tried another human cell lines they also tried it in Monkey kidney cells it also worked they tested it on the Wuhan strain and three other variants of concern and it also worked the ability to infect cells was comparable uh was comparably inhibited by cannabidiol so in all of these uh the Wuhan strain the three variants of concern all of them couldn't effectively or as effectively infect the cells treated with cannabidiol so it looks like it's working for all of the SARS coronavirus 2 viruses and as we say very likely to work for other viruses now um they tried quite a few they tried few a few preparations of cannabidiol to make sure it wasn't just the um um the particular preparation so here they add different suppliers um here they have the positivity of the spike protein and we see here that as the doses go up the numbers go down until up up in these doses here we essentially have no viral expression and as we say these are non-toxic doses that you could have used and they actually tested these with various methods to make sure that it was fairly pure cannabidial and they found out it was 97 to 100 percent uh pure cannabidiol because when you extract products from natural plants like the hemp plant you're going to get other alkaloids in there or as well other other cannabis products as well but they were sure it was the the CBD and one of its as we'll see one of its metabolites that was having the benefit so was it the other cannibaloids well no they checked so basically it wasn't the other cannibaloids 97 to 100 pure using quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance uh scanning don't pretend to give and know much about that at all but it is an industry standard way of measuring compounds in in plants and things like that so it is an accurate way to do it that is uh that is clear no toxicity was observed for any of the CBD preparations that the dose is used to inhibit viral replication no toxicity this was safe at the dose is used it could be scaled up to the whole human body and the CBD metabolite so it was CBD and its metabolite seven hydroxycannabidiol now what happens here is the um this is quite common for example if you take codeine for example the codeine itself isn't a very a very good painkiller but it goes to the liver and the liver converts it into morphine so the reason that um the the reason that codeine is an effective analgesic is it is the metabolite is morphine and in the same way here the CBD worked and one of its metabolites there's seven hydroxycanabadaric her cannibidiol also was anti-viral so two ways to win there the CBD probably working originally when you take it then some of that's broken down into this uh seven hydroxy cannabidiol and that goes on working for a period of time so uh and interestingly these are exactly the same molecules that are known to be effective in suppressing uh some forms of um seizures that people take cannabis for already or this particular CBD preparation for so both of these the CBD and its metabolites exhibited antiviral activity the other cannabis compounds did not work and combining CBD with tetrahydrocannabenol significantly suppressed CBD activity so taking taking the sort of cannabis that gets people high would not work that's important to stress taking the Cannabis that gets people who I would not work because it's it basically there's a competition between the THC and the CBD and that stops the CBD working and the CBD and its metabolites are the active and uh equipotent ingredient for the treatment of epilepsy so that's why it works so the same things that work in epilepsy are the same things that are hiring this newly discovered antiviral that's very impressive antiviral property so it's working by uh early steps after viral entry into cells it's reducing that CBD targets host cell processes uh CBD exhibits uh viral RNA expression and reverse virus induced changes in in the host genome so in other words the virus actually what the virus does is it changes quite a few things in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the cell to make it more hospitable for itself the CBD undoes those changes quite amazing really I mean I don't pretend to understand how it does this but uh they did identify quite a few mechanisms that uh that can work for that CBD effectively eradicated viral RNA expression in the host cells I mean wow they weren't getting the viral expression the virus just couldn't reproduce inside those cells um prevents changes in the cell produced by the virus to force the cell to produce new viral particles so the the virus has got all these mechanisms to take over the uh the CBD blocks those C produces in strong activation of genes associated with host stress response now the stress response is the way that the cell responds to the infection and the CBD initiates the activation of genes which help that response so if you like the CBD it's partly working by genetically upgrading the cell by stimulating the genes to to make more antiviral activity in the cell quite amazing but this is what the biochemistry shows direct quote from the paper together these results suggest that CBD acts to prevent viral protein translation and Associated cellular changes amazing induction of viral genes for Spike envelope and nucleocapsulin protein is reduced by 99 percent just incredible just incredible um so if this had been if this is demonstrated to be effective as it looks if if everyone in the uh Wuhan area or around the people that were first infected won't go into the story of that now but if they've been on CBD that could have been a firewall around about this virus and pandemic might have never occurred non-toxic simple cheap readily available by the Tongue nothing complicated no huge profits for anyone and uh of course if it had been eradicated at source we would have never have needed the vaccinations either because there would have been no pandemic uh cbgd uh induction of increased transcription of three defense genes as we've said and these affect the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell which I won't go into but it's part of the cell that's associated with the ribosomes which makes the the new viruses it stops those from working also CBG induces interferons we've talked about interferons before interferons are antiviral uh cytokines really antiviral uh um signal molecules that when when a cell is infected by a virus it can release interferon and that goes to the cells around about and tells them to prepare for the infection so it kind of puts a firewall around about the infection so stimulating interferons also very uh important part of protection against viral infection promotes degradation of viral RNA so it messes up the viral RNA SARS coronavirus 2 infection suppressing the interferon signaling Pathways so it so the SARS coronavirus 2 would interfere with the interferon activity this undoes the Damage Done by the SARS coronavirus 2 and allows the interferon to carry on and indeed stimulates the interferon CBD effectively lowers the viral Titus so the viruses aren't there to add their suppression to the interferon as well CBD effectively reverses viral induced cytokines that can lead to the deadly cytokine storm so if this was given to so this work is about early infection but it sounds like it's also um could have saved many many lives by preventing the cytokine storm which of course would kill people of course the acute respiratory distress syndrome really quite amazing look at this paper it really is quite quite a oppressive array of effects that you wouldn't have expected CBD treatment significantly inhibits SARS coronavirus 2 replication in mice so the mice were deliberately infected with a virus a viral challenge they were given CBD twice a day for four days and CBD treatment significantly inhibited viral replication in the lungs and in the noses at five days CBD lowered lower Dosa so the lower dose of CBD if they gave a lower dose of CBD it reduced the viral dose in the lungs by a 4.8 fold higher dose of 40 times Less Price than the lungs and you know for most people that will be the difference between getting sick and not getting sick this is really quite quite staggering and even the higher dose was a non-toxic dose it was not making the mice sick the mice did not stop eating they did not lose weight the mice did not get sick but they had 40 times less virus in their lungs looking like a very safe way of doing this during this period the mice showed no signs of clinical disease and didn't get sick from the drug the authors say these results established the pre-clinical efficacy of CBD as an antiviral drug for SARS coronavirus 2 in the early stages of infection but potentially in the later stages because of the um reduced cytokines now what about humans CBD is negatively associated with uh with the indications of SARS grown advice to infection in patients medical records now here what they did was they looked up these more than 1200 patients so they're on CBD already and found that they got less infection they didn't follow them up when they got sick unfortunately but it would be interesting because it would be likely that they got that they didn't get sick as much because they weren't getting infected as much and the viral lobe will be lower of course all these things should be done with full-scale clinical trials but as we said that's probably not going to happen um unfortunately given that high Purity CBD preparations are taken by large numbers of individuals we examine where the CBD prescriptions are associated with uh interactions of SARS coronavirus to infection now apparently people are taking all solutions of CBD at 100 micrograms a ml um often using the treatment of seizures they analyzed 1200 patients taking already they then made up a control group match for age sex all the variables uh they found that 75 patients um with CB uh six six point two percent of the patient 75 patients with CBD got infected at 8.9 for non-cbd patients now this doesn't sound like a big difference 6.2 um got infected with CBD 8.9 got infected without CBD but of course this is absolute risk for the whole population so this is a huge difference and it worked out it worked out so the odds ratio in other words um it was a 45 protection for people that were probably taking it but for people that were sure taking it it was a 52 the odds ratio of uh four 4.48 52 protection and again these results are very significant only six chances in a thousand that arose by chance so these people were not getting infected this was having about a 50 people taking the adequate dose or having a 50 protection um against against infection um it's it really is quite quite significant pity they didn't have follow-up data on if they got sick or not but um as we say that that work wasn't outside the scope of this study potential for the cannabidiol for treatment of viral hepatitis that's the study there it looking good here it was CBD inhibited hepatitis C viral replication by 86 percent didn't work hepatitis B now this is interesting hepatitis C is an RNA virus Hepatitis B is a DNA virus so it looks like the data we have that this is working for RNA viruses probably not for DNA viruses but if we could get rid of the RNA viruses effectively and I've had an effective treatment for RNA viruses that would help to put it mildly let's just look at some of these infections common colds whether it's rhinoviruses or um coronaviruses are RNA viruses influenza is an RNA virus SARS 1 and Middle East for spider syndrome Dengue terrible disease hepatitis c and e all RNA viruses Ebola rabies polio mumps measles all RNA viruses if this turns out to be an effective treatment for RNA viruses this would be a major massive step forward in medical practice so I think what we need to do is take these clinical trials out of the hands of big Pharma because as we say I don't think they're going to do it because you can't make money out of CBD but this is a drug which could be precious for Humanity therefore governments and other agencies need to take on This research and we need to know definitively if this works and if it does it could be a Wonder treatment for many conditions let's hope this is done the work we have so far is impressive I'm really quite impressed with this article as you can probably tell um we'll leave it there because that's as far as the data goes thank you for watching"

them off to school and then when I get back meetings I have with my team maybe going out to eat with a friend for lunch or something like that and my base and my safety by then it's like the day flies by and it's time to go pick up the kids didn't hear the crunching I grew up in a very religious conservative environment it wasn't until I got older that I realized how oppressive of a space that was and how much I shrank Who I Really Am to be who they told me I'm supposed to be I was trained to be a pastor for three years and then I pastored for a year growing up I wasn't allowed as a woman to be a leader a speaker or a pastor so even to become a pastor was seen as rebellious and wrong when I was in my late 20s I went to a church that allowed female preachers what a concept and very quickly loved speaking and teaching and preaching and yet the higher rows or climb that ladder the more I saw how women still weren't given as much privilege or payment as the men and I became pretty disillusioned and eventually walked away I came out in 2016 and that was a turning point in my life so I am queer and one thing you'll learn is that queer can mean many different things I identify as pansexual for me it just means I'm attracted to all genders I'm a very loving person I went my whole life thinking I was straight married a man had three kids with him never thought to question it and then it was in my mid early 30s that I realized oh my gosh I'm queer and that became a catalyst that changed my entire life I began examining everything I thought I knew about myself if I was wrong about my sexuality what else might I be wrong about I walked away from everything with no idea where I was headed I just knew I couldn't stay in the confines I had been raised in and needed to give myself permission to go past the line that was drawn for me and just see what was out there now I know that was the choice that led to my freedom I've been an adult content creator for three and a half years now and everything in my life has exploded for the better my freedom my autonomy my income when I learned about these online platforms where I could do adult content from the comfort of my own home I was excited because it was a way for me to honor how I'm wired do something I love and hopefully make some money at it I am now a millionaire due to my adult content creation oh that bounce is nice my career gives me so much freedom and flexibility it has made me a better mom not only am I not stressed like I used to be when we were on food stamps but I also have way more time and freedom to be with them what do you guys think Mommy does for her job my kids know that I'm a model so they know I'm a lingerie nude model they see all my lingerie they see my adult toys they see the different photographers and photo shoots at my house they know that that's part of what Mommy does do you think it's weird or cool that like I'm on the internet and kind of famous it's cool yeah we talk a lot about adult content my home in the sense of what's appropriate for kids what's appropriate for adults if they see something that they know is for an adult to come get me when they learn more specific details of what I do I think they'll actually be more prepared I do experience sometimes where my kids will have friends and then once their friends parents find out what I do they ghost us and they won't ever contact us again and it does it makes my heart incredibly sad for my children because my children are just pure beings of love it's hard to make friends as a mom in the adult industry I think I cause a lot of cognitive dissonance people see this like loving Suburban mom and our kids that get along and we get along and then as soon as they find out what they do it's like they freeze it's a little heartbreaking but I just understand the context with where we live that that would happen I think my mom's the coolest because she's the one who hacked me and loves me you're the best I'm the luckiest mom luckiest mom in the world I love you so much [Music] my bedroom's kind of my Haven my kids are in school full time so when they're at schools when they film most of my content when I do my one-on-one calls with my fans once my kids are home I'm here I'm engaged I'm present I've received so much hate I get a lot of messages about how I'm going to hell about how I'm a terrible mother the trauma I'm doing to my children and that really hurts I've had someone call me a child molester which to have that thrown at me is so vile courses like heartbreaking to read but I know at the end of the day they don't know who I am and so I just let them imagine the monster that I am knowing it's their imagination and not my reality the best comment is that I am the leader of the Illuminati which I didn't even know what that was until I got that comment I had to Google what is the Illuminati and then I died Michael oh hi yeah coffee amazing thank you so much yes you're so welcome I think that the hate that Nicole receives because of her career and her choices is unnecessary I mean who are we to judge people do you think about sexuality as a human species like that is the first thing that we know and understand ultimately I think that those people who hate are just your biggest fans and they don't know it yet I love that you said that because some of my biggest critics have become become my client and so this proof right there like the people who are actively campaigning against me on social media leaving hate comments have gone on to then hire me to be their life coach okay let me see you serious face serious face we probably grew up in homes where there's a lot of Secrets and I just never wanted that with my kids I wanted them to be aware and included and educated of course in age-appropriate ways I think that level of openness is probably a huge parameter of safety for a kid and so I think it's really beautiful that you do that I have no plan on quitting the adult industry it's been so fun so freeing so lucrative so supportive that I'll continue to stay in it for as long as I have interest in it I think a mom is allowed to do whatever she wants just because she becomes a mom doesn't mean she's now only allowed to do certain things with her life or her body I have two responses to haters one is like Fu and then part of me is just say when you look at my life and you spend five minutes in my world you see it's a really beautiful thing I have going on do the burritos have anything they'd like to say Don't eat me did you hear that"

success got reframed into crazy numbers like you had movies coming out 15 years ago it's like you know what's better than a million a billion like you know it all got weird I think people are confused out there what's success a million dollars 10 million dollars 100 million dollars it's a million dollars like you get to decide what success is what are some of the things that you sacrificed to get where you are today and do you think it's possible to reach a high level of business success without immense sacrifice of course it's a possibility if you decide to Define business success at a certain level I would argue that business that's living and breathing that is alive and growing that makes the founder eight hundred thousand dollars a year is an outrageously successful business the top one percent earners in America make 480 000 a year you're a top one percent success and at eight hundred thousand dollars a year take home from a small business one does not have to sacrifice in the way that the question was posed right at that level you don't have to work 19 hours a day you can have 60 hour work weeks 45 hour work weeks achieve that level of financial success and still have family time and still have your mental health I mean I don't think mental health has a number I know people that are struggling with mental health that have businesses that do forty thousand a year and I know people that have do not have mental health issues and have good you know um content happy peace of mind that run 300 million a year businesses so I don't think Mental Health has a direct attribute with guys and scale I think it goes back a little bit to self-esteem self-awareness I also think for by show of hands because I see most of you how many of you in this class intuitively believe like doing business or being an entrepreneur is as fun to you as like playing sports or watching TV or skiing or like like it's like the most fun raise your hand right so like you know for me that group is going to struggle to burn out if their literal favorite thing on earth and their Hobby and their fun is business building of course there's sacrifices but but I don't know if you know this there's a lot of people in this classroom Professor I don't know if you know this there's a lot of people you and I know who do not own businesses who are employees who sacrifice things too sacrifice is just a reality of life but you get to decide what success is right like what's success a million dollars 10 million dollars 100 million dollars trillion dollar like like you know to me why I love entrepreneurship for me success is being able to do what you want to do every day and living within the means of how much money you have so if you don't have tons and tons and tons of money well then you fly private everywhere anytime you want but having the freedom to create and do your thing well that doesn't take that much money um so you know I think this is a very complex question I think a lot of kids are and a lot of grown-ups are confused by this I I don't think you have to be unhappy like you know to like win you know like I think you can build an Empire on your terms and in your way I also think people lack patience I think people want money too fast I think that hurts them I think that's where I think people burn out or sacrifice because they're trying to win too fast to show everybody that they won I'm petrified of people thinking entrepreneurship is cool and like just doing it because they think it's cool it's hard when we were growing up if you've made a million dollars a year you you were big time now like if you told the majority of the most ambitious kids in this room that they're only going to make a million bucks a year Max in their career they would think like they up oh my God and so I think like success got reframed into crazy numbers like you had movies coming out saying like Justin Timberlake's I mean making a movie 15 years ago that's like you know what's better than a million a billion like like you know it all got weird and the separation of wealth and Society has gotten weird and too extreme and so like I think people are confused out there uh hi Gary so just relating to the concept of failing fast and learning from your past mistakes how can individuals reframe their perception of failure and um use as a tool for growth and progress a lot of you were of the generation where failure started to get demonized right back to me and Professor being older like there was no such thing as any trophy for anybody than besides the people that won Little League and so we created a culture in the last 30 40 years where we tried to over protect people from failure you know when you when I hear that question from you I get scared because when I think about the school system Society for the last 30 40 years we didn't do a lot of favors for people to get comfortable with losing we demonized it we by over protecting people from it we made them think it was bad humans not gen Z not emerging gen Alpha not Boomers like humans need to practice losing a lot more so the answer to the question is it's easy go do you'll lose all that entrepreneurship is is micro losing with the occasional macro win"

      "corpus": "- Sup, you beautiful bastards, welcome back to \"The Philip DeFranco Show.\" Hope you've had a fantastic Monday, but a quick announcement right here at the top. I'm so pumped to announce this surprise drop over at BeautifulBastard.com, where for one week only you can grab these four exclusive drops. We got that Keep going, everything will be all right goodness, our awesome. One day we'll all be skeletons gear, as well as your fantastic reminder to embrace change. And finally, our chaotic, emotionally exhausted premium shirts and hoodies. And I would argue most importantly that we got our shipping fixed, so everything actually should go out within a week. So grab any and all while you can, the clock is ticking, but we got a lot of news to talk about, so let's just jump into it. Starting with, there's a pretty good chance you remember this woman. - Monday of this week my children were the targets of attempted kidnap. - Right, that is Katie Sorensen, she's a mom, she's an Instagram influencer, she went viral in late 2020 with a shocking story because according to her account, she took her two kids to a Michael's Craft Store in California to get stuff for holiday gifts. But inside a man and a woman followed them around the store and she heard him describing her children's physical features, possibly to someone on the phone. With the couple then standing in line behind her despite not buying anything and when she left, they followed, with the man allegedly reaching out as if to grab her stroller, causing her to scream. At which point the couple flees to their car, they take off, and so Katie reports this to the police and then tells the story to over 4.5 million people on Instagram. But the cops ended up being surprised that her online story included way more details than her police report so they looked into it further and they discovered that both the statements of the supposed kidnappers and the surveillance footage flatly contradicted her account. So they ended up prosecuting her and saying that she made up this entire story to boost her social media following. And now the big news is that the jury has actually convicted her of filing a false police report for which she faces up to six months in jail. With a couple that she pointed the finger at saying the same thing two years ago when this happened. - She wanted a stronger following, she was looking for, you know, content for her fame and her income, and at our expense. - And then \"Wall Street Journal\" just dropped an absolute bomb about Jeffrey Epstein. Turns out, not a good guy. No, that's not what it is. Rather, they published a devastating report detailing a number of high profile figures who had previously unreported connections with Jeffrey Epstein, big thing, years after he was a convicted sex offender. The information stemming from a collection of documents that include thousands of pages of emails and schedules from 2013 to 2017 and notably, had never been reported until now. According to reports, William Burns, the current director of the CIA, had three meetings scheduled with Epstein in 2014 when he was Deputy Secretary of State. And adding that they first met in Washington and then Burns visited Epstein's townhouse in Manhattan. Also, Kathryn Ruemmler, a White House council under President Obama, had dozens of meetings with Epstein in the years after her White House service and before she became a top lawyer at Goldman Sachs Group. Also noting that Epstein planned on her to join a trip to Paris in 2014 and a visit to his private island in 2017. Also mentioned was Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College, who invited Epstein, who brought a group of young female guests to the campus. As well as famous professor, author, and activist Noam Chomsky, who was scheduled to fly with Epstein to have dinner at Epstein's Manhattan townhouse in 2015. With the report going on to say that the documents show that Epstein arranged multiple meetings with each of them after he had served jail time in 2008 for a sex crime involving a teenage girl and while he was registered as a sex offender. But also adding that they don't reveal the purpose of most of those meetings and \"The Wall Street Journal\" couldn't verify whether every scheduled meeting took place. That said though, some of the people named in the report or their representatives spoke to the outlet. A spokesperson for the CIA saying that Director Burns had indeed met with Epstein about a decade ago but added, the director did not know anything about him other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector and offered general advice on transition to the private sector, claiming they had no relationship. And adding that Burns remembered being introduced to Epstein in Washington and meeting once in New York. Additionally, a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs confirmed that Ruemmler did have a professional relationship with Epstein and adding that the lawyer said, I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein. But there, the documents appeared to reveal that he knew her quite well. With \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that he had asked for food that she liked to be on hand for meetings, visited apartments that she was considering buying, and even knew of her travel plans, telling an assistant in 2014 to look into her flight to see if she could be upgraded to first class. Beyond that, the records also reportedly showed that Epstein and his staff had discussed whether Ruemmler would be uncomfortable with the presence of young women who worked as assistants and staffers at the townhouse. And the outlet adding that women emailed Epstein on two occasions to ask if they should avoid the home while Miss Ruemmler was there. And Epstein telling one of the women he didn't want her around and another that it wasn't a problem. And over the course of a few years, Ruemmler had more than three dozen appointments with Epstein including for lunches and dinners. But the Goldman Sachs spokesperson did claim that she never visited his island and never accepted an invitation or an opportunity to fly with Jeffrey Epstein anywhere. Meanwhile, Botstein said he was just trying to convince Epstein to donotate to his school, with \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that the Bard College president had about two dozen meetings scheduled with Epstein over about four years, which were mostly visits to the townhouse. And the article also reporting numerous scheduled meetings between Epstein and Chomsky, including one where Epstein was planning to fly with Chomsky and his wife to have dinner with Woody Allen and his wife. Now Chomsky, for his part, confirmed that he had met with Epstein on multiple occasions but was vague about the meeting with Woody Allen while also seemingly defending the director. Right, who of course has also been famously accused of sex crimes against minors, saying, \"If there was a flight, which I doubt, it would've been from Boston to New York, 30 minutes.\" But also notably both Botstein and Chomsky told \"The Wall Street Journal\" they believed that Epstein had served his time while they met with him and appeared to have no issue with his sorted past. With Botstein saying, we looked him up and he was a convicted felon for a sex crime. We believe in rehabilitation. While Chomsky argued that at the time of his meetings what was known about Jeffrey Epstein was that he had been convicted of a crime and had served his sentence, and saying according to US laws and norms that yields a clean slate. But also a key takeaway here is that all those people we just talked about were just some of the prominent figures flagged in the documents. But the records also reportedly mentioning scheduled meetings with members of the Rothschild family, Harvard University Professor Martin Noack, prominent businessman Joshua Cooper Ramo, and an Israeli Prime Minister among others. And then, Dave Chappelle, depending on who you ask, is a beloved or hated figure. And as it turns out he's also a pretty divisive figure where he lives, Yellow Springs, Ohio. A place you've seen connected to Chappelle in so many headlines over the years, whether it be for hosting outdoor socially distanced comedy shows during the pandemic or for interfering with the development of property there that could be partially used for affordable housing and then also buying that land. You know, this town has been described as a very unique place. It has strong historical and cultural roots, Chappelle previously describing it as \"a Bernie Sanders island in a Trump sea.\" With Bloomberg saying that his politics can be summed up by a sign at a local church that reads, 10:30 AM Sunday, an eco-feminist interpretation of Genesis 1:3, in person, masks required. What places like Bloomberg are doing right now is they're really focusing on Chappelle's property ownership, because reportedly around 2018 he incorporated a holdings company and began buying properties in the downtown area. So much so that by 2022, under both his name and under the Holdings company, he owned a total of 20 properties in the county with a lot of these properties being commercial or business location. And so a meeting with local business owners was held, including with Chappelle, with one item on the agenda being, \"Dave's up to something.\" With that part starting with praise for Chappelle helping the town's economy amid Covid. Chappelle also sharing his vision of the town being a cultural mecca. But you also had Chappelle feeling insulted that there were so many people suspicious of his efforts, especially given everything he's done for the community. But also on the other side you had business owners feeling disrespected for Chappelle snapping at them. And so after that, some local businesses put out signs in support of Chappelle, thanking him for his contribution, while others just didn't and no matter what stance of business took it kind of felt loud. With Bloomberg speaking to people on both sides here what they notice is that you had a lot of people saying Chappelle has a strong base of support in the village, but also noting that few people will actually say anything critical of Chappelle on the record. But with that, off the record some called him a force that's turning us into the place we're all trying to stay away from. Some even comparing him to Trump for his pattern of not apologizing, doubling down, and blaming someone else. And all of this coming as the topic of property and land ownership in Yellow Springs has been a very hot one as it's facing serious housing issues right now, with reports explaining the tight housing supply has left Yellow Springs richer, older and whiter. And noting as of 2020, the village was less than 11% black down from 26% in 1970. And reporting with no condos or apartments to downsize into, retirees keep their under-occupied homes off the market While young families and service workers end up in the exceptional but cheaper cities nearby. With one source touting out that a lot of people wanna blame Chappelle for the town becoming so unaffordable, even though that blame might be unfair. I will say, if you want an even deeper dive into this, I'll link to the Bloomberg report down in the links. It seems like just a messy situation in this town, but also one that asks a lot of questions. Right, Chappelle getting lots of credit for helping the town amid a pandemic, reviving local businesses, does that earn a person unlimited goodwill? Or also, at what point are you allowed to question someone who has done a lot of good, supported a lot of livelihoods? Or how do you balance and separate praise that exists of him in one arena and the criticism that he might face in others? And then for any of you focused on getting your business off the ground, creating a place to share your homemade goods, new favorite hobby, current obsession, or even a personal blog to get all those thoughts outta your head, I got a great solution and from that, I wanna thank the fantastic sponsor of today's show, Squarespace.

And then Adidas is now facing a class action lawsuit 'cause of Kanye, with investors claiming that the company was well aware of the harm that Kanye posed to the brand, but they just failed to act on that knowledge or warn investors. In fact, according to the lawsuit, executives discussed the risks of collaborating with Kanye as far back as 2018. And while you could argue Kanye had not gone full Nazi then, the lawsuit claims that Kanye made anti-Semitic comments in front of the Adidas staff and even suggested he might name an album after Hitler. And so with that saying that Adidas failed to take meaningful precautionary measures to limit negative financial exposure. Though for their part, Adidas has denied any wrongdoing, saying we outright reject these unfounded claims and will take all necessary measures to vigorously defend ourselves against them. And all this notably coming roughly six months after Adidas dropped Kanye over his anti-Semitic and hateful outbursts, a split that the company later said could cost it well over a billion dollars. And then what the hell is going on with banks right now? That's a question popping into a lot of minds this morning with the news coming out that JPMorgan Chase is now buying out most of First Republic Bank. Right, with First Republic Bank being the second largest bank failure in American history. And the deal's actually a pretty good one for JPMorgan Chase. With the cost of just 11 billion to the FDIC, they'll get essentially all of First Republic's assets. And on top of that, the FDIC promised to cover 80% of the losses from First Republic's mortgage loans for five to seven years as well as getting major financing from the FDIC. There's also a bunch of other numbers associated with the deal, but when all is said and done, they're expected to get a one time gain of $2.6 billion out of the deal, although they'll also spend about 2 billion in restructuring over the next year or so. But even then, that's like what, an easy $600 million for the banking giant? Not to mention the potential long term gains which also led to a little stock bump. Now as far as the FDIC, it'll lose about $13 billion from the deal, although that money is ultimately paid by American banks through their premiums to insurance. And then the tragic death of Irvo Otieno goes way deeper than anyone first thought. Right, so this whole shitstorm kicked off on March 3rd when Virginia Police took 28 year old Irvo into custody while investigating a suspected burglary. They accused him of attacking them and his mother says that he had a history of mental illness and was suffering mental distress in the days leading to his arrest. And then while he was in jail, surveillance video shows officers entering his cell and confronting him, with a prosecutor saying that he was kneed, punched, and pepper sprayed. Next you see them struggling to get him into a white van so they put him in a police SUV instead, driving him to Central State Hospital, a local psychiatric facility where he would remain for the rest of his life. But that's only because on March 6th, while he was shackled and handcuffed, 10 people smothered Irvo with their bodies for at least 11 minutes until he died from suffocation. So we had Irvo's mother garnering nationwide sympathy with her heart-wrenching words at this press conference. - Irvo was my baby. He was special. He had an infectious smile. Oh, I miss his smile! He was handsome, he was a hunk. My baby was handsome, you all know, you all know. - And now all 10 people involved in Irvo's death, including three hospital staff and seven sheriffs deputies, have been charged with second degree murder. But also we now know from an investigation by \"Insider\" that this case, though extreme, is just a part of a long pattern of abuse at the hospital. With employees over the last five years substantiating 31 reports of physical abuse, 33 of neglect, nine of verbal abuse, and three of patient exploitation. Moreover, there were more than 600 cases of abuse that couldn't be substantiated, including 56 of sexual abuse. One of those incidents came just one day after Irvo's death involving one of the three staff members who were charged there. And then there's a manhunt still underway for the monster who shot and killed five of his neighbors, including an eight-year-old, with an AR style rifle in Cleveland, Texas. Where according to authorities the shooting took place late Friday night after the suspect had been shooting his gun in his yard when his neighbor, Wilson Garcia, asked him to stop so his baby could sleep. With Garcia saying the man told him that he would do what he wanted in his yard so Garcia told him that he'd just call the police if he didn't stop. With this monster responding by walking across Garcia's yard and shooting his wife who was standing at the front door. With Garcia then telling local reporters that this man then went room to room looking for people, noting that he and his wife had company over that night. With this monster then fatally shooting Garcia's eight-year-old son and three others in the house. And according to the county sheriff, Greg Capers, two of the women were killed while protecting Garcia's baby and two-year-old daughter and adding that the children are now safe and with family. Authorities also saying the suspect had been drinking when the attack occurred, and that he had a history of shooting his rifle in his yard, prompting neighbors to call law enforcement on him before. But when question by reporters about whether the suspect could legally shoot his gun in his yard, Sheriff Caper said it depended on how large the property was and where the weapon was pointed. With this there's also been criticism of Texas law enforcement's handling of the situation. Officers reportedly responded by searching the wooded area near the neighborhood where the shooting took place but lost the suspect's trail. And currently more than 250 officers from local, state, and federal agencies are participating in this manhunt but authorities say they have no leads. With officials also offering $80,000 for any information that could lead to the arrest of the suspect, though they have warned that he could be armed and dangerous. And James Smith, the FBI's special agent in charge, telling reporters, \"What we need from the public is any type of information because right now we're just running into dead ends.\" And adding, \"We have zero leads.\" The situation also hasn't been helped by the fact that law enforcement officials say they had mistakenly disseminated an incorrect image of the suspect that was circulated by the press and on social media before a correction was made. Though there, it's not just law enforcement officials that are facing backlash right now, with Texas Governor Greg Abbott also being slammed for his response to the attack. Right, because Abbott tweeted, \"I've announced a 50K reward for info on the criminal who killed five illegal immigrants on Friday.\" With him also noting that the suspected gunman was quote, \"In the country illegally.\" But a lot of the outrage has been focused on his language around the victims. Right, these are people who were murdered, why not just call them people, why talk about their immigration status? With the belief being that this is kind of a dog whistle. And it prompting widespread outrage from tons of people on social media who accused him of delegitimizing the attack, with Texas representative Veronica Escobar tweeting, \"They were part of a family, Greg Abbott, and one of the victims was a child. What a disgusting lack of compassion and humanity.\" And state Senator Roland Gutierrez saying the statement was \"a new low for Greg Abbott, who continues to do nothing to keep Texas safe from gun violence.\" And adding, \"Greg, how is an undocumented person able to obtain an AR-15 in the first place? I'll tell you why, it's because you and other Republicans have made safe gun laws non-existent.\" Additionally, we saw Abbott's post being flagged by Twitter and hit with the label \"Readers added context they thought people might want to know.\" And that linking to a tweet posted by an immigrant rights activist who tweeted out a photo of an id he said was from one of the victims and wrote, \"I just spoke to the husband of one of the victims. He confirmed to me that his wife was a permanent resident of the US. He even sent me a picture of her ID confirming this. But I guess to Greg Abbott, anyone who is from another country is an illegal immigrant. Shameful.\" But I do wanna note as a recording, that hasn't been verified by law enforcement. But ultimately that is where we are in this developing story and as we get more news, I'll keep you in the loop. But all of that is a news you need to know today. As always, thankfully being a part of my daily dives into the news my name's Philip DeFranco, you've just been filled in, I love your faces, and I'll see you tomorrow."

second but if you don't know them let me explain to you why a simple tweet that I put out suggesting that we were in talks to have these two box each other we're absolutely viral getting 5 million views why the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is this happening because it's a circus event I mean I'll be honest I'll I'll probably watch it I am very curious to see how this unfolds these are two LOL cows you have to keep that in mind and they they know that they're self-aware but winning this fight is a huge step in a direction away from a LOL cow foreign [Music] ER 360 420 ask me today if I would show off my Nerf collection that's right Just Dance gonna be okay go [\u00a0__\u00a0] yourself buggy started his career on YouTube making France's videos a character he played that would rage smash the Christmas tree smash an Xbox or something he even had this one video where he acted like he was hacked in World of Warcraft it went absolutely viral getting a shout out from Ray William Johnson at the time however as he was making these Francis videos he was getting insecure because the comments were all thinking that's who he really was hey guys you should be Francis I know I look weird right now because I got my camera I got my camera about set up here so Boogie started making different videos covering all different topics on the internet showing the audience that he wasn't actually the France his person a lot of you say that I inspire you and I think that's amazing but there's somebody out there who inspires me and his name is uh Diamond Dallas Page unfortunately by over sharing who he really was it opened him up to even more bullying online validated so much of the pain there this bit inside of me for example many of these bullies would constantly make up rumors that his wife at the time was cheating on him and then when he publicly announced that they were getting a divorce that was the fuel that the bullies need to go in full force it was pretty great being public with that because we shared all of the really good parts of our life but just like anywhere else or anyone else on social media I did not show the bad times and our marriage was far from perfect over the last decade The Bullying got so extreme and so insane that one of these bullies showed up at Boogie's house to harass him in real life Boogie came out with a firearm and shot a warning shot fired the warning shot now to scare the bully away but instead Boogie got arrested for shooting the gun in city limits for those of you wondering why I haven't been on social media it is because I was in fact charged because of that incident that happened last September when a stalker came to my house um even with all this Boogie's done pretty good financially on the YouTube platform but after a divorce and after losing a lot of money in crypto currently boogies on the verge of losing his home but I put my money in the crypto Market in the wrong section and I pretty much lost most of everyone that sucks that really sucks it is what it is though I mean like I've come to terms with it but I need to get back to work I have some savings but they're going quickly and if I don't start live streaming and making content and getting ad revenue and stuff again I'm gonna lose everything and I definitely do not want to do that and uh we had a and b and they were trapped at C and I got back there with the with a Winchester 1200 and the guy would just keep spawning there I ended up killing him 27 times because somebody kept popping up there wings of redemption was one of the first Call of Duty YouTubers and at the time everybody had horrible quality videos using a capture device known as a Dazzle Wings had a huge advantage over his competitors because he had a harpod HD and his video quality was much better he would upload videos to YouTube with his Call of Duty gameplays and then tell life stories over them oh man I'm back and I'm here to save you from some dull commentary it's your boy wings of redemption Wings became so successful that it became a Machinima director which was a big deal back in the day I think people think I had this anger issue I don't have anger issues he was so successful that he started a podcast known as PKA with FPS Kyle well and Woody's gamer tag from the podcast Wings was known for his crazy tags because I like the guy to have a pretty penis too hi at it again wings of redemption his career was only going up but then he had a 1v1 Call of Duty match versus a zombies player known as Tom Syndicate now Tom Syndicate played zombies right he didn't even play against real people and wings of redemption was known as a Call of Duty God so this was going to be an easy win for wings foreign I Broke My Controller controller after the devastating loss against Tom Syndicate in the 1v1 Call of Duty [\u00a0__\u00a0] why the [\u00a0__\u00a0] you stream that [\u00a0__\u00a0] wings of redemption's career started going into a major decline he was no longer known as a good Call of Duty player but even though his career was on the decline he still had a wildly successful podcast on PKA until Woody's gamer tag and FPS Kyle and wings decided to do a PKA camping trip they were supposed to all meet in the woods and try to survive on absolutely nothing for like 48 Hours Woody's gamer tag showed up FPS Kyle showed up Wings did not show up Woody and Kyle were so upset that Wings didn't show up that they kicked him off his own podcast this doesn't [\u00a0__\u00a0] come he just doesn't [\u00a0__\u00a0] come and and and it's now it's just me and Woody in the woods after this his video stopped getting less views and he didn't even have his podcast anymore so in order to make ends meet he had to stream video games to make money look here look listen [Music] then the audience got to see the real wings of redemption what it is so [\u00a0__\u00a0] bad [Music] can't do it I can't take this [\u00a0__\u00a0] no more man raging and freaking out because he lost in a video game so [\u00a0__\u00a0] bad Wings has been stuck in the last decade of a horrible Loop of bullying and harassment wings and Boogie have a lot in common first of all they're both fat weighing in at like 400 pounds each both of them had weight loss surgery you know like a rubber band on their stomach so they couldn't eat as much they both lost a bunch of weight and then gained it all back both wings and Boogie were some of the first creators on the platform Wings starting in 2008 Boogie starting in 2006 they both had a thriving career and now their careers in the pits okay so listen all right Misfit boxing is ksi's company it's huge it's massive like eight or ten events a year millions and millions of fans and as you know I have been setting up boxing matches behind the scenes for years right here on the show on drop alert and currently a bunch of my Fighters over at happy punch fight on Misfits I have a good relationship with them so mams Taylor over at Misfit boxing asks happy punch myself to set up the prelims for the next KSI Pay-Per-View event if you don't know what prelims are they're like the fights that you get to watch for free before the pay-per-view starts I say yes but I want complete creative control and they tell me you can set up any four fights you want anyone this is my moment I have to break the internet I have to set up a fight that you you you can't even refuse not to watch it so of course I go for Boogie and wings because this is so impossible like this fight can never happen there's like so many obstacles first of all Boogie is a giant [\u00a0__\u00a0] no he is he's never been in a fight in his life he's constantly apologizing I'm sorry guys I'm sorry like what the the idea of him fighting someone physically no way it's not happening wings or Redemption doesn't leave his mobile home he lives in a trailer and he is not leaving it all right he was supposed to go to PKA on that camping trip trip did he show up no on top of that in order to do a boxing match you gotta get approved by a doctor you you got to get your Medicals done all right they need to make sure you're healthy enough to actually do a boxing match these two soda drinking like way whales are probably the most unhealthy people on all of YouTube and on top of that these guys got bullies trolls people that harass them on a daily basis and their haters have been trying to get them put on a do not fly list ever since this ever started I'm not joking but the biggest challenge for these two are the Medicals I needed to get these guys in shape I started talking to them in February to make this thing happen and I've been calling them every single day to make sure they're not drinking soda to make sure that they're like doing some sort of cardio that they're punching a bag and they would tell me that they're losing weight they would tell me that they're exercising but I didn't believe them I just see it for myself are you rolling down just hit it ladies and gentlemen we're about two minutes out from being the first YouTubers ever to go to Wings of redemption's house and let me tell you uh I'm on the edge of my seat literally driving to this thing I don't know if I'm pulling up to a mansion or a double wide the rumor on the street is we're pulling up to a double line though I've never been more excited in my life this I've done a lot of things but this might be my favorite day of all time I'm super I don't even know what to say the myth the man the wind the wings of redemption of redemption oh my God we're getting so close bro this is like meeting Santa for me he's like a mythical there's the first YouTuber I ever watched for Call of Duty this is my hero I've never seen you more excited than right now girl I have a pretty excited guy but this this might be a top three for me is way nicer well he said he was getting a new roof this one needs a new roof yeah this one needs one that one is are you sure this is it this is what what it looked like when I pulled it up okay open the door there is an exercise bike on the porch well there it is and there's neon lights back there oh that's him [Music] oh dude yeah hold on be cool I don't want him to know yeah what's up Wings what's up bro yeah what's going on you're like can I get a photo like right off the bat yeah he does I don't know why so buggies basically been saying that you know he's definitely going to win this that you can't stand up more than 45 seconds that's a lot these are two minute rounds are you gonna make it through these rounds easy as far as conditioning the first one yeah like I figured you want me to be honest yeah I figured the first one is going to be I'm gonna be exhausted by the end of the first round and then it's going to be a hug-a-thon yeah a lot of clinching yeah a lot of clinching a lot of hugs but honestly I'm hoping to get it out for 30 seconds is amazing [Music] [\u00a0__\u00a0] pretty quick on the jab too quick cardio I would not want to be getting hit with these things that's some power on those shots oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] bro [Music] thank you [Music] becomes a super hard one all right it's gonna be tough touch the jaw chin down there it comes all right one two why are you doing this fight why did you agree to it the only honest answer yeah the honest answer is savings like I want to put my savings is not where I want it to be and I want more money to put into savings like I don't want to get into the strategy with it don't tell us your strategy just what round one round two kotko drops him out of the ring how you feeling it's gonna be most likely I figure the rest gonna stop it so I think I don't hit hard enough to put Boogie completely out but I hit hard enough to put him down and like you know can Boogie get up I mean Boogie's 48 years old you know he's got he's on disability a fifth of his life um you know he's probably got some type of arthritis like if I put him down once can you get up in 10 seconds I don't know for all you that said wings or Redemption ain't gonna do it it's getting done questions [Music] there it is [Applause] now it's all up to boogie2988 Arkansas here we come and ladies and gentlemen we're now at the site of the pistol shot the scene of the crime the scene of the crime we're talking about Mountain Dew drinking buggy 2988 oh my God that's that's yeah that's it that is it it's gonna be fun oh my [\u00a0__\u00a0] god that's where Frank Castle harassed the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of Boogie and he pulled out a gun from like the 1800s dude who's gonna rob a stage coach with it let's see where he's shot Mike look he shot the gun that way in the air he could have killed someone foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] because this is two 400 pound men who have effectively I'm sorry Jordy but we've effectively ruined our own lives we've ruined our own bodies right we've ruined our own careers and this is us fighting for our lives fighting for our careers fighting for our respect fighting for ourselves I mean there's a bag involved and that's great but that's not why either of us doing this I hope not okay it really comes down to the fact that I think you're going to see two desperate men who are desperate for relevance desperate to get better desperate to get healthy desperate to to be better people fighting it out in that ring that's why I'm doing it that's you know and if I have to go through Jordy to get to a better life if I have to go to Jordy to get strong to get better to get healthier I'm going right through them it's taking every ounce of of character and strength I have to actually go through with this my brain is constantly telling me this is dangerous this is scary back out back out back out there's no backing out right I'm going through it and when I go through with it I hope I earn some Community respect but I think the respect that I'm really going to earn is mine that's that's who needs to learn a little bit of respect right like that's the thing that I've always been afraid of man I've been afraid of doing dangerous things I've been afraid of doing crazy things I sought comfort and that Comfort became my prison right I've not been taking the risks that a human is supposed to take and this is making up for that and if you and if you die in that ring then what a way to go man right like we all want to die fighting we all want to die a warrior we all want to die fighting for our our health our life or the people we love our self-respect uh You Gotta Die of something would it be better to die in the ring or die in one of these [\u00a0__\u00a0] chairs sitting around this house playing video games what's the better

what that is me neither I never did this in school or anything but we looked it up in like some people somewhere have done it we're split into team of three team of three and Me by myself because they thought it would be more fair that way ad teams have been given a bunch of 300 dropped off at Home Depot and given two hours to collect our supplies after that we head back to the house I'd have two hours to build our designs each bulb must have at least one member of the team in it and as soon as it touches the water the timer starts you have to pile your bow from one end of the pool to the other and back and the fastest team wins baby host Lily and Jody oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] hey buddy you smart looks like you're going in the boat Lily you know what he is no no no you are building it I'm building stuff too between you and me I have more experience who weighs less oh yeah actually out of all of us hmm hey thank you so uh who's going in the boat nose goes he didn't you you lost your own nose pose in a good old boat here I've never built the boat I didn't do this in high school my original thought was just to put a big clear storage containers in the water and that would be my boat but I don't think it's like stable or buoyant enough one maybe two maybe three Home Depot buckets together on either side I imagine it would be a combination of zip ties and like rope and then like a one paddle and we get a flag what are we thinking Confederate no no please no not that boat not if I'm captaining it like this makes it kind of hard to like push your paddle out of so I was hoping maybe like I'd get like a weed whacker together maybe tear apart like a fan and he's like the blades was a propeller yeah all right let's make our s'mores or whatever man I feel good about this I feel

of wood a door yes a wooden door like this how much is this this honestly yeah this feels light actually have you seen the Titanic we're gonna put someone on a piece of door it's already cooked it's perfect it's cheap dude I hope no one sees this behind the door if plenty of people buy doors no no I mean the other teams this is I want this to be my propulsion system a hundred dollars for an electric one wow electric is cheaper than gas this looks sweet I like the color the color design of the boat okay yeah yeah your seat I need my cockpit yeah yeah ah looks so good see that would float on its own oh wow dude should I get like a lawn chair to put in this I played a game called raft right whenever you put a wood down there was like four buckets under it they used the you pick up plastic and you pick up wood out of the ocean and you make this oh no you know it sounds good to me let's get the [\u00a0__\u00a0] buckets how many buckets we'll get a cart so we can load up some buckets with lids this is absorbent or is it is the same as pool floaties it feels like this it should be okay if water gets in the middle I think we buy those cut them in half and then just zip tie them to the bar yeah that's just easier actually let's just do that I think you're putting them this way but that's way easier but we still need like the water jugs we still need the buoyance things [Music] take the fan open it up take the fan blades fan blades are now my propeller okay let's get like the small stuff stamp she's in her own world all right we lived up and then we're gonna drop it towards your front Okay we only need one right yeah I don't think we're gonna dump do you want to double up no no no I say we do the fight we are video Gamers let's do the raft ID let's put the buckets under the plywood oh call it good okay well it's a bubble wrap at the same time it'll be easy to measure too because it'll be like bucket bucket okay okay I think we're actually the Geniuses Oz I think there's no way it'll sink in fact I'm so confident I'm willing to go on our boat after maybe maybe mulch ing moisture levels and starting your garden mold need to feed your family of four mulch okay seven dollars for a thing a two-stroke gas that's pretty good I think my boat might float but I I think the weed whacker is going to explode I didn't when I made the gas powered fishing pole out of my dad's weed whacker um that exploded a little bit but above ground you know like above water I think if it's in water it's totally fine I want it clear so that I can see the the Fauna of the ocean floor and I think I got a weed whack on my shoulder and it goes here are your two options of paddles I think this one would be good for length this one is a great shape though problem is that it's short though so like I don't know how far I think with the size of our door you stand on it you probably have to like lay on it so something short would actually be good how do we make these things stick do we have zip top epoxy pill epoxy glue oh it's like a paddle board almost oh these are very light like I do think it'll slow maybe we replaced the door with these I think we should get some of these okay okay 265 dollars they're 30 bucks ah here comes the last team oh wait I don't oh I see some stuff I hope it starts pouring whenever uh oh I hope so too we're back from Home Depot and we're gonna build our boats for two hours guys I I don't think it's gonna work tonight yes I agree with that yeah it's sunny it's funny it's not raining yes I didn't have to bring an umbrella let's go all right the faster we finish this the faster we can stop doing stuff you want to take a [\u00a0__\u00a0] don't you yeah can you are we stop I need to take a [\u00a0__\u00a0] as well probably a really big one because it's been backed up for like three days or something all right we have a door yeah what I'm thinking with these purple stuff around the border of the door so it's like a little box or yeah like a more reasonable thing would be to like put it under make small adjustments in additions until it floats so we start with the door throw the door into the pool you get on it if it floats we don't have to modify I have a microphone in my pocket we all have microphones in Alpha why do I have to get on it I forgot what I was gonna do that's a weed work what is it what is he doing guys oh I stole this I I didn't check these out I forgot let's check out the floatability of this here bucket oh yeah that floats oh that's so much weight holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh I'm not okay I'm not going anywhere but across that pond our first draft was inspired by raft let's say you stand on um bucket bucket Berry like I feel like you're gonna be playing like this balance game yeah yeah I will get in a very low stance so what I'm thinking is we can like legit measure by like just glue the lids glue and then this and just just glue all the lids on and yeah like it looks right I like that yeah oh yeah we can like what is this man doing I think that's his engine over here with a blank of wood and some buckets well no no no in our paddle yeah oh it needs to spin really fast to start but then it can run on idle something you just start it like this and then add this right so then you don't have to get hit with that like initial burst of speed I should probably do the actual thing first so that's what I'm saying I want to set up our pontoons super critical that these are hounded down and like you know sealed this is stupid I'll just assume that it's on hey I'm gonna hey can you sit on this for a sec wow can you just sit like you would rope all right so I think we just cut off what do you think I'll do it yeah offline TV is going to cover like any injuries and deaths and stuff like that right Michael how do you use this oh please don't use that huh please don't use that just use specifically how do I cut the wood oh I hope okay um okay no no apply a lot I think I

      "corpus": "no no not at all that's BS no totally totally BS yep yep yeah who said that how would they know me okay think about that do you honestly believe that's credible so this is 20 2006. I'm a junior officer do you honestly think that they would have remembered me from Adam of course not so that is the uh impassioned response of Governor Ron DeSantis to journalist who is confronting him about his time earlier in his career at Guantanamo Bay where uh now uh prisoners who had been at Guantanamo Bay at that point are saying that uh DeSantis stood by and laughed as uh they were tortured forced feedings and those sorts of things so we actually know a little bit about this there's been some prior reporting um and once you learn the details maybe you'll understand why he was so freaked out about the questions that were coming his way so he did serve as a lawyer echoantanamo Bay back in 2006 uh he arrived at Guantanamo in the midst of mass hunger strikes among detainees protesting their treatment at the prison he arrived as part of a team of military lawyers to help solve the situation he has talked about this before as well five years ago saying for these detainees the Jihad was still ongoing and they would wage Jihad any way they can some of the things they would do they would do hunger strikes so everything at that time was legal in nature one way or in another so the commander wants to know well how do I combat this just briefly stop for there's nothing I love more than seeing someone trained as a lawyer who's now an executive saying like stuff was legal one way or another definitely an ethical approach to life he says so what are the jobs of legal advisor would be like hey you actually can force feed here's what you can do here's kind of the rules of that again very worried about the law you can do it kind of I guess look that's what they were sent to do they wanted some sort of like plausible deniability some sort of cover an excuse to be able to do what they wanted to do which was force feed these people torture them in a variety of different ways and that's what he did now he never explicitly states that he told anyone to force feed any particular prisoner so he didn't say you can force feed that prisoner but he is openly in many years later that he was part of the justification to do that sort of thing and he actually has said a bit more about his experience there saying you also had a lot of detainees claiming abuse because this was in the wake of Abu ghraib and that was used offensively against our guards what I learned from that and I took to a rock when I was working with Seal Team One is they're using things like detainee abuse offensively against us it was a tactic technique and procedure yeah that was really the most egregious thing about Abu ghraib was that it was uh it was bad for us that was really what I learned from that as well so look we know who Ronda santis is we know what he saw his role there now we can get into the specific claims that are made about different prisoners there's um you know there's five prisoners who have talked about seeing him at these sorts of things some have said specifically that he was there for their Force feedings um as of right now look we're never going to be able to say definitively video is not going to come out but this is something that has dogged him for some time the question I want to ask you guys and I want to start with you David is does he even need to worry about this like if video did come out or photos and he's literally like I'm a great like pointing at the detainees being force-fed it's a Republican primary do we think that they would care if this was Trump he would own it he'd be like yeah that's right I stopped the terrorist I was there myself I saved America while Rhonda Sanders runs away from it so you know it's it's possible Veronica Sanders is thinking more about you know Mass Appeal as opposed to a Republican primary but we know that if this was Trump he would absolutely own this and what I find interesting about desantis's uh response here is that he he he he says you know how would they remember me as if you wouldn't remember the person that helped to torture you like how would that not be seared into your brain like of course they would remember you and with multiple people saying this look obviously we don't know for sure right but it's it's kind of hard to deny when he himself is on the record saying yeah I was you know he was a part of this so it's not a stretch to say he was also in the room at the time they are oh I think it's cool just the fact that he's being held to account in a public space at all for this um and my opinion is that uh now let's do Alberto Gonzalez let's do uh George Bush let's do Cheney let's do Rumsfeld let's do all of these guys that presided over the torture regime because I mean you know the Iraq War obviously has forever sullied America's reputation abroad not that it was very Sterling to begin with thank you CIA um but this torches stuff this idea that Americans um the foreign policy regime of America uh the foreign policy bureaucracy because it's not even a regime these people don't lose their freaking jobs um that they've seated that moral High Ground a long time ago and part of it is this this torture stuff and so if if Rhonda Sanchez is the first guy to ever ever get a public vlogging for their role in um the torture at Guantanamo and black sites all over the world then hey man I'm with it even if nothing comes of it I'm glad he has to wear this around his neck um with public shame and ridicule meanwhile think about what we give a pass to like Donald Trump massively increased the number of bombings and drone strikes while he was present thousands of people died uh plenty of them are bad sure lots of more civilians they're dead not just tortured dead wiped out hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people who would even like if you went in the media and raised that as a concern they would look at you like you were a swamp creature like you were a Madman but with the torture maybe I guess because he was a lawyer we don't want to start questioning presidents and if DeSantis becomes president by the way the questions will be over you will not be asked them anymore but when he was a lawyer then maybe we can get him on something it's just so weird the the areas where they could be criticized and the the massive areas of great power where they cannot"

      "corpus": "if I were to ask you to describe the ideal picture of Health and Wellness what would you say for me it used to be two young white women blonde hair and perfect ponytails which any woman will tell you is an impossible feat wearing Lululemon pants smiling at each other and carrying yoga mats and green juices this picture is not only an attempt to sell health and wellness or even the implicit message that we need to be thin young fit and beautiful the picture also conveys the message that if we don't have these things then we have no business liking and respecting Who We Are it's not only an oversimplified image of Health it's an exclusionary one a fat phobic ableist and elitist one I say this standing before he was a young ish thin white middle class woman and that privilege is not lost on me but in my 20s I too suffered from this ideal image of Health and Wellness my food and Body Image issues were never formally diagnosed no one not my family my friends or even my doctor had noticed that I had placed my entire self-worth in my appearance because I was the fit healthy one but under the surface I was mentally and physically beating against a current of social messaging that told me if I didn't put myself under the pressure to be thin eat clean and White Knuckle a workout every single day that I would have somehow failed not worthy of love and acceptance I'm living proof of just a few of the dangers that lie within this single story this ideal image of Health and Wellness this stereotypical and elitist image of Wellness must first be recognized for what it is and then challenged and dismantled we need to not only broaden our vision of Wellness pass the number on the scale pass putting that number first in our self-worth last but to also help to facilitate and educate those in disadvantaged communities to pursue health that they can pursue health despite obstacles to do so Camden is experiencing food apartheid others would prefer the term food desert a food desert is a place where people's access to Affordable healthy food is limited due to a lack of nearby supermarkets in fact over 34 000 people in the city of Camden alone are experiencing food insecurity now many consider the term food desert to be a misnomer a desert after all is a naturally occurring ecosystem whereas many believe food deserts are intentionally created through public policy and economic practice apartheid is perhaps a more appropriate term as it speaks to systemic discrimination now semantics aside this isn't just a Camden problem last year 1.3 million people in New Jersey experience food insecurity zoom out even further and you'll find that this problem affects 19 million Americans according to World Bank the number of people experiencing food insecurity globally was estimated to reach a staggering 222 million people in 53 countries and territories at the end of this past year and as you might expect the consequences of food insecurity are vast physical consequences range from slower healing of wounds to stunted growth poor eyesight perhaps even more unsettling are the mental consequences of malnutrition like slower brain development decreased attention span increased depression but we knew that malnutrition led to poor health outcomes so why don't these people just hop in the car and drive to the nearest supermarket well this is where socioeconomics plays in about 2.3 million Americans live more than 10 miles away from a supermarket and don't own a car the fact that this happens in places below the poverty line perpetuates the idea that those who are not wealthy can't pursue health that it's a luxury they can't afford now add on a layer of marginalization communities of color experience more food and economic insecurity globally this again reinforces the idea that those in marginalized communities can pursue health or at least the kind splayed on magazine covers and on social media so what is there to do well many proposed tax incentives for grocery stores to break ground in these areas most studies are finding that time and money are the biggest issues not geography so the big unanswered question becomes how can people be healthy when they don't fit the typical picture of Health and beyond that beyond the Practical strategies of stretching time and money how can we dismantle this stereotypical image in a way that allows people to feel like they deserve to pursue health how can we breathe new life into the definition of what it means to pursue Health to make it more inclusive well first things first let's tackle some of the logistical Solutions utilizing Community Gardens to grow your own produce visiting local food pantries and soup kitchens buying Frozen fruits vegetables and meats the latter has a stigma that continues to baffle me frozen foods can actually have more vitamins and nutrients Fresh Foods lose these over time whereas freezing preserves them but we have become a culture obsessed with Fresh Foods and clearly not even because they're healthier for us but because they elicit a certain aesthetic and because they're more expensive it creates a subtext about the type of people who get to buy Fresh Foods versus the type of people who have to buy Frozen but even with all these actionable tips we still have the biggest issue of all the second part of the unanswered question how can we make health and wellness more inclusive one way is to broaden what we consider healthy food the past 20 years have seen a push toward organic non-GMO foods but from a nutritional standpoint there's barely a difference we demonize fast food chains but many offer healthy options now like grilled chicken salad and oatmeal with fruit but still we moralize the consumption of certain foods over others the subconscious narrative creates an air of privilege around Wellness you're either in purchasing organic foods or you're not you're either part of the health club or you're not and membership to this club isn't even just contingent on our food habits it's what side of the tracks we live on whether we pay a rent or a mortgage whether we own a gym membership this caricature of Optimal Health has invaded so many facets of Our Lives and I fear that we are passively subscribing to this version of Health that leaves so many unable to afford the price of admission the next way to create more inclusive health is to shift our Focus for why we should be eating nourishing foods so many sources out there speak of the Obesity epidemic The Narrative has become we must eat healthy so we don't get fat this supports the idea that our weight is the most important factor in our health and that's simply not true our body size and shape is determined largely by genetics a whopping 80 percent therefore a mere 20 comes down to lifestyle choices only one of which is diet so obesity as a result of food choices doesn't reveal the whole picture what other factors are common among these groups to create poor health outcomes could it be I don't know increase stress to make ends meet poor air quality the fact that over a quarter of people below the poverty line smoke double the rate of those above the poverty line the child from a poor family is seven times less likely to graduate high school instead of focusing solely on food in relation to health we need to broaden what constitutes healthy Behavior Health includes factors like exercise sure yoga and spin classes are fun but they're also expensive can you find exercise equipment on Craigslist or do bodyweight exercises in your home can you use the stairs at work Health also includes self-care massages and facials are luxurious but you know what else can fill your cup TV when you're watching TV with someone you are relaxing laughing connecting these are essential for our Mental Health but still even for others these strategies fall short if we examine these tactics on a global scale we have people who don't have freezers or Facebook or Netflix what about them this likely requires a more broad discussion of solutions like education empowerment and the strengthening of our Grassroots organizations but it also starts with us here in this room those who have the resources to Access Health and Wellness it's getting involved with organizations that provide Global food assistance it's communicating the importance of farmers markets to local legislators it's being mindful of how we purchase and use the foods we buy to minimize waste but we can't use any of these strategies in any meaningful way if we don't learn to smudge our black and white thinking to create a gray area in which all can participate healthism conveys the idea that our health is not only completely in our control but somehow a moral imperative healthism makes those that don't fit social media's version of Health feel like failures when we label Foods as good and bad and the bad foods are the only ones accessible to certain people we are implicitly labeling these people bad labeling them moral failures this creates feelings of unworthiness that do nothing to turn a tie that has become generational it only continues to turn a cogwheel of Oppression and marginalization that still exists today if we want to talk moral responsibility we have the responsibility to recreate a version of Health that is not moralized in elitist but it's multifaceted flexible and inclusive for all this conversation is not enough to address the multi-systemic issues that have contributed to the inequities that we see and who gets to experience Health and Wellness it's not enough to address the nuances not only of the problems but of the solutions but it is enough to implore us to consider our privilege we have the resources to Access Health and Wellness but is also our privilege to Dethrone our idealized vision of Health and Wellness to be agents of change to shatter the stigma to help make health and wellness accessible to all and to reaffirm to those who have been marginalized that they belong to the club not only of Health but of humanity"

this podcast and we have the average temperature which is a YouTuber series uh that deals with the environmental issues and others use deals with you know food and environmental issues also climate action and stuff like that and it was interesting because you people reached out to me uh to go and to be on your podcast and it was almost simultaneously when our people when they asked my people to reach out to you to have you on my show on stamp dish so here we are both of us together yeah this is the stamp dish exactly you don't have to have been a shot you can take it out of the shot here's mine but I want to say one thing I cannot believe you send you you send this to me all the way to Spain exactly and you send me you send me bonbons yes amazing from Vienna you send me these napolitans I guess very typically yes yes okay can you pronounce again Mr Wafers you know it's like it's like a Austin kind of a thing but I I I want you you and your whole team enjoying this and the good girls up here which is a good Austrian beer but I also want to say thank you very much for sending me uh your wine Spanish wine in the morning I'm gonna have for the first time before coffee and before breakfast I'm gonna have a little bit of wine cheers cheers cheers and longer tables together good beer oh yeah wine man you you Spanish people know exactly how to make wine I tell you well let me tell you I think uh Austrian people know how to make beer and and and other things uh uh I will say first of all I just want to say right off the top um that those people that don't know that they're watching the stump dish uh you know Jose is one of the most famous and extraordinary chefs in the world and not only because he is an extraordinary chef and not only because he started as a kid already with this business of learning how to be a chef and open the breast announce in in Spain that were very successful then moved to America with the age of 21 the same age I was when I moved uh to uh to America and then moved to New York first and then to the Washington and started with his Partners a whole bunch of wrestling unsuccessful restaurants so it's important for you guys to know that the followers of the storm dish that maybe it doesn't know so much about us say he's just an extraordinary successful restaurant and is you know is in the food in The Culinary business has his whole life he's very passionate about it has it been an award-winning chef and not only in World winning chef but also got the presidential medal from President Obama in 2015 for orifice extraordinary work and this is important now to for you to understand all of you that he is not just been so great with his you know restaurant business and all this but he said it's not just about me it's about we and this he had this idea of creating the world's Central Kitchen that those who of you that don't know about that there's an extraordinary idea that whenever there is a problem anywhere in the world it doesn't matter if it is an earthquake somewhere or if it is the fires like in California we had orders fires and all of a sudden he set up the world Central Kitchen in California within days he was here and organized and I was even up there I remember serving breakfast uh to our firefighters and all that stuff but so he's just unbelievable giving he gives back to the community and to his country into the world and all this stuff and this is what made him really famous now because everyone is just saying oh how can he do all of this so I just want to ask you my first question right off the top a do you know how many things we have in common Jose there'll be both immigrants till we both move to America with the age of 21 then we both became successful here in America we both already have been successful before we got here and we're passionate we both end up giving back we both are the chairs of the president's Council of physical fitness we both ended the environment and I can go on for the next hour about the things that we have in common and we both are good looking dudes let's be honest military service I could go on for hours and hours so my question is just you know what made you fall in love with the culinary business in the first place when you were a kid and you said okay my life will be about cooking food for people I want to be a chef how did you get into that and my dad were both nurses um my mom will be the one cooking more during the week um and my father are more on the weekends for more friends my father and love love to cook and feeding people my mom had more the love to feed in the family and making sure that my three brothers and I we will be fat for me growing up boys every morning will be walking on the bike going to the bakery to buy the bread the juice came hot out of the oven uh if I didn't behave a way for my mother to punish me will be not giving the opportunity to go in the morning to pick up the hot bread I will eat the bread halfway to my home because it was so good when it first happened so and so crispy so I I use watch my mom feeding us my father feeding us and friends and they always put so much love especially my mom with leftovers you know Governor I don't remember any dish on the beginning of the month when there was money because my father and mother used got the paycheck and you will see that they will buy and fill up the fridge but I remember when the fridge was empty at the end of the month my mother will be able to do amazing things out of nothing if she had some leftover bread crumbs bread she will make bread crumbs with it and she will then get whatever was the leftover boil egg or ham and she will make a bechamel everybody knows Bechamel flour and milk and you will make this kind of thick cream she will put whatever leftovers were in the fridge and then next day she will make balls and roll them on egg wash and the breadcrumbs and then she will fry them this is what in a Spam we call croquetas I learned that almost every country has like a version of of something raw and bread crumbs I I love those croquetas my brothers love those Croquettes so if you tell me the spirit of my mom and my dad be nurses that always you got this mentality we saw it during the pandemic that they always give back even beyond their duty to me they were I always knew that nurses and doctors were always Heroes because we don't realize the amazing work uh they do unfortunately we had to have a pandemic to realize how important they are in in our our society but then also to see the love that my mom will put feeding my brothers and I and the love that my father will put cooking big pots of rice of paella for anybody in the hospital my father always say that if there is that big problems have very simple Solutions uh if more people show up he will say use add more rice to the pen and problem will be solved so I think for me cooking was something I saw as something like brought people together that that made families better not perfect but better because cooking together kind of you become a stronger and very very very difficult everybody has a way to to explain it but but you setting up the table sitting um doesn't matter how good or bad the dish was use the effort that and the love that was put into the cooking is what is some of the best memories I have yeah but I mean what's interesting about it is it's really fascinating you know to see that your mother was a nurse and your father was a nurse and they all worked together in the hospital and all that stuff and that's what got you into food and into cooking and becoming a chef but there's millions and millions of chefs out there but only very few that are having the business mind and the real power and the vision all of a sudden to go and says I'm going to use this talent and I'm going to create a business and I'm going to be self-employed and I'm gonna go and take that risk and take investors in and to be partners in the office and start opening it's a very risky thing to do to go into a business yourself right rather than working for someone and having no headaches and just going to work so what what made that bridge what built that bridge then obviously you say I'm going to go into America and I'm going to go and open my breast around and I'm going to be a famous restaurant there on the successful one well for me America was something I always saw through the movies uh in in a way you are responsible through through movies that I wanted to be part of America where everything's impossible when I came I came to America first uh before I was 21 uh on the Spanish Navy I came sailing in a ship and I saw the amazing American flag and um what the symbols I remember be next to Ellis Island and Lady Liberty and I'm like I wanna I wanna be part of America so when I finish my military service uh I got the opportunity to come to New York to be a a cook in a restaurant and and I came to learn and I came to be experiencing everything that America seems was offering which was the freedom if you were hard to become whatever you wanted and when I arrived Washington DC I came I was 23. this is 1993 I moved from New York that I arrived like a young boy where everything was learning New York for me was like the perfect melting pot was not only the perfect melting pot but the perfect university for a cook that wants to learn about cooking in New York I could learn about every single restaurant cooking of any country and region from anywhere around the world I became a better cook because being in Manhattan but when I arrived DC I was offered this job by amazing people that they always made sure that my success was their success and I use began doing what I know how to do I say I don't I don't open business I don't open restaurants I am a storyteller how do I tell stories the only way I know I tell stories through the dishes that made me who I am behind every dish is a story behind every dish is people that made that dish happen without realizing I was a cook but without realizing I also realize that I could be a storytelling a Storyteller telling people where I came from through the dishes I was putting on the menu it's fantastic but I mean what is the amazing thing is not only did you uh become a great chef and then it became a great restaurant there and let this restaurant that everyone that says has thousands and thousands of fans that are coming back and coming back and eating their and and all this but I mean at what point did you get this idea well I want to do even more work as if you were not already working hard enough working 15 hours a day with those restaurants but you say I want to add to this work and I want to create the world Central Kitchen how did that happen did you decided that there's so many people out there that need food there's war zones they need food there's fires there's earthquakes there's problem there's there's Flats in this this misery around the world I gotta go and feed those people I mean how did that come about I mean what was your drive to give something back at the same time I arrived uh uh Washington DC Governor I began volunteering in organization called DC Central Kitchen this is Central Kitchen was amazing because was firing food waste which we know has a lot to do with global warming bringing that food that was untouched and actually it happened on uh Ronald Reagan Inauguration Day the day was funded the 35 plus years ago but take a look what happened here the guy that founded this rubber Egger was a bartender and he saw that food waste was not really the only problem the problem is that we were wasting people's lives so he brought the food that was untouched and really ready to throw garbage and he brought the people to a kitchen began training the people to become Cooks those Cooks will make sure that the food waste was no food waste but food opportunity and making meals to feed the Homeless population of Washington DC I became a volunteer I became the chairman of the organization I learned so much watching how a plate of food could be really an agent of change not throwing money at the problem but investing into the solutions you as a governor knows this very well we were fighting food waste giving opportunity to people training them feeding the homeless and in the process finding jobs to those men and women that once they graduated after the training will join the ranks of different restaurants around the sea brilliant but at the same time I was watching what happened in Katrina at the same time I was watching in the distance how we left a man and woman sometimes like in the Superdome four days without food and water the system was overwhelmed because sometimes government cannot do it all everybody forgets that government is only as good as its citizens and FEMA who is organization in charge of providing response and bringing different ngos to make it happen in certain events could be overwhelmed that's when actually didn't began really in the States but when Haiti happened the big hurray the big earthquake in 2010 I said you know this is Mayor I am a cook and when you have an emergency you send nurses and doctors to take care of the Wounded you send the firefighters to take care of the fires but when you have to feed people in an emergency who do you think is the most prepared people those are Cooks of the wall so I went to Haiti and is when wall Central Kitchen was created without realizing over the last 14 years we've been in so many places in the fires in California in Ventura and some other places in the volcano in Hawaii and in the volcano and Guatemala we've been in the war in Ukraine we've been uh in the earthquake in turkey and Syria we've been in the in Bahamas after Dorian at the end it's a very simple thing what we do governor uh in the way we see it every restaurant every Chef every cook every volunteer every person that drives a car and can deliver uh every every helicopter pilot uh everybody belongs to wall Sandra kitchen what happened they don't know a jet we go to a place and we are able to feed people quickly and fast because we use local resources we use the local assets and more important we allow the locals to join us because nobody knows better than the locals at the end with the people we become one we are able to reach 1 million meals a day in matter of days in a very organized sometimes illogical way but in a way that we don't come with a plan we adapt adaptation is I would say the trademark of world Central Kitchen if you have a plan you will fail because every emergency is different but if you are that to every emergency you can always respond that's a matter of what happens well I I I think that you're giving government a little bit too much of a break here because I think it was a disastrous performance in the government's part when it comes to some of those emergencies and to me I don't think it's an excuse to say that the government gets overwhelmed but you didn't get overwhelmed you didn't get over you weren't there and you've heard the people and you were organized and you were helping they were frozen for weeks they were frozen until they did something about it and I think that happens to a lot of places where there's emergencies and I think that this important thing is is to just really be willing to go in there of course as you said for you and for government for everyone it's the same thing every emergency is different you don't know when you go to Ukraine how are you going to put everyone together you don't know when you go to Haiti uh you know how to pull everyone together and to know all the chefs and bring them together you did not know when you came to California how to pull all of this together and what did the firefighters really need and what time do they eat and all of those kind of things but you did it you adopted very quickly to the situation you did it but the government has sometimes has a real difficult time in doing that and so I think just the world of the things that you're doing and my question is just you know of at what point did you find out that the environment is something that benefits here with all of this when you say talk about food waste because you're absolutely right I mean for for decades and decades restaurants threw food away and they never even saw the Synergy that we could actually use this food and feed those that need food there's so many hungry people that every city has that the homeless people that are out there that need to have food and oils and then eventually someone comes up with this plan to use actually this food that is not to make it a waste but actually to make it an asset and to feed people I mean and then that has an environmental kind of connection because food waste creates a huge amount of greenhouse gases and pollution in the world and for you to kind of cut that down by using it how did you come up with that idea and at what time did all of a sudden the environment become important to you well uh uh I'm going to put the environment front and center in public domain we saw vice president Gore doing the same people like you are people that they they've helped create in people like me this mentality that obviously the environment is very important uh but one of the things I've been saying lately for a few years now is that I don't believe we are giving food the importance it deserves I believe that food only sits at the Department of Agriculture at the USDA and seems the Department of Agriculture event does amazing things uh it's good lunches and the farm bill sometimes it's there at the service of of the very big companies which by the way I want to have a very big company I have no problems with very big companies but they don't want big companies taking advantage of subsidies when the small farmers can't I don't want the big restaurant chains take advantage of those subsidies in the way a smaller restaurants can and you're gonna tell me Jose what this has to do with environment everything has to do with environment because I am realizing that one of the biggest factors we have and one of the areas that becomes a problem is food food is the reason why we have hunger or the lack of it lack of Distribution food is the reason why we have health issues obesity and all the other sickness that happens because over eating uh food is the one that in many ways is putting a lot of CO2 in the process of feeding uh Humanity in the way we produce Foods is one of the reasons why we are contaminating our waterways and our oceans because we are contaminating our oceans food is also scarce because without oxygen like in the Gulf of Mexico all of the sudden you see only but dead fish in the beaches all across the world at the end food is everything food is defense for this energy for this immigration reform cannot be that the people that feed America and the people that feed the world some times cannot feed themselves cannot be that we have 11 million undocumented working in farms in America but we are not able to give them once and for all the right to belong no ghost of the system but people that with work permits or green cards or whatever is that the Democrats and Republicans agree we will give them finally the decency to belong to America so at the end what I was trying to say is that food is so important that I I've been calling for a long time to presidents around the world that we need to have National Security food advisors next to every governor next to every president because there are a lot of problems that we create in the way we manage food when actually food can be an amazing opportunity to solve problems from the CO2 emissions to hunger 2 two obesity two etc etc food is the solution food must stop being the problem and the environment will be one of the biggest beneficiaries used to end you know what is one of the biggest contributors of CO2 and in the process also makes people poor the way people feed themselves the way people cook actually almost three billion people three billion people cook with charcoal with fossil fuels they cook with three rocks on the floor and some wood or some charcoal in the process of feeding themselves they're making themselves unhealthy they're making themselves poorer and they're making they're cutting down the trees and they're making pollution happening more and more one of the biggest opportunities we have and this is what I would love for you in your next conference that you are living in Austria talking about environmental issues is that the the issue about the kitchens clean kitchens that will fit the wall we will be a very important issue that you will talk because I do believe if we provide every family in the world with a clean kitchen like you and I have a home we can help to have better better climate we we will fight CO2 emissions we will fight poverty we will find Hunger we will fight deforestation we will fight so many things just by having cleaner technology for cooking and feeding every family around the world I think this is a brilliant idea and we definitely will bring this up in our discussion with our environmental conference at our time at conference in Vienna in May and tell you one thing that uh I think it's a good idea what you had about recommending uh for governments to have their own food advisory person there but I just want to suggest to you to let the private sector set up those advice prices and not government because otherwise it's a political appointment and they will not be able to go and solve the problems again just like it was with any of the disasters so I think the private sector should set that up but I think it's a brilliant idea and I also hope that you will be there at our conference one time and talk about all of the issues that you care about I want to give you an invitation today to come if it's this year May 16th is our conference in Vienna and because I think it is such an important issue you know the environment is something I'm very passionate about but we have to address the environmental issue just like you said from so many different angles if it is you know what kind of cars do we drive you know what kind of a power do we generate is it from fossil fuels or is it power that is renewable ended from a renewable energy and all of this kind of things it's the what what transportation system should we have how do we go and eliminate you know the pollution that kills seven million people a year is really the question and there's indoor pollution as you have talked about charcoal about food and all this stuff it's also there's just millions of people still in some of the third world countries that have stoves inside their home and they're burning in a corn and they're burning wood and they're inhaling this exhaust and certain the pollution so that they die from in inside pollution air pollution so I think there's so many issues we have to talk about I love you taking the food so I hope that you can go and join us one time at that World Conference and I want to say thank you very much for this great great interview you've done a great job keep up the good work and remember when one immigrant asks another immigrant for help we are always there for each other okay we are always there for each other and remember Governor what we do immigrants like you and I we build Bridges we build Bridges between far away places and we show that people we are more equal to each other and that we should love each other more than use hate each other immigrants like you and I we we we are so important everybody everybody should be in a way an immigrant that's right absolutely thank you very much I'm proud of you keep up the great work okay and if you need anything let me know I will answers next time listen you and I we have an accent huh you and I that's the other thing we have in common we have an accent yeah that's for sure [Laughter] have a good day [Music] thank you"

      "corpus": "it is important that we look at this with a very clear understanding of contextualization because when people step into the middle of your story they misdiagnose Who You Are and they make false assumptions based on brief statements we're living in an age now where people will take a snippet of a sermon and write an argument against a snippet [Applause] a phrase one statement you put out and they say they know you by phrase as if you could be reduced to a sentence see the quickest way to get into heresy is to take a text out of context now I'm all for technology but sometimes when people text me I have to pick up the phone and call them because sometimes you you you you meant it in one way but I read it in another way and before I respond I read it I just want to be sure do you really mean for me to go off like I'm getting ready to go off you know I just want to be sure let's set some rules straight because I might have read it in the wrong turn and most of the time I was wrong because it is difficult to deliver sensitive information in the text because the text does not give you context so as we read this brief statement these four verses of scripture in the gospel of Saint Mark chapter one I'm not sure that this text of a scripture gives us context Jesus wasn't born in the wilderness neither did he grow up in a wilderness okay nor was he baptized in the wilderness and yet he finds himself in the wilderness I have been in the same spot that Jesus was in I had the privilege years ago of going to Jerusalem and not only going to Jerusalem which is amazing but going down to the Jordan and across the Jordan River into the country of Jordan and when you cross the Jordan River you are standing in what is now currently called Jordan and you're on your way to Amman but you have to go through the Wilderness to get there and little did I know that the same Wilderness I was standing in is the Wilderness in which Jesus was tempted is also the place where Elijah comes having crossed the Jordan to be caught up in the Chariot of fire so the history of the text goes archaeologically deep into the soil of the same space a lot of things happen in the same geographical location so in the same place that God sends a chariot down from heaven to evacuate Elijah out of the human capacities of this mundane ritualistic world it is in that same spot where he allows the spirit to carry Jesus to be tempted have you ever had a spot that provoked many different memories a house she used to live in and you can remember good times and bad times a person you grew up with and you remember something nice and you remember something yeah yeah yeah spaces are complicated and the spirit has brought him to this place but I don't want to take the text out of context it is important that we understand that Jesus has dropped off the scene for at least 18 years we know nothing and it is funny to me because the Bible gives us the highlights of the life of Jesus and not the nothing moments of his life and the hardest parts of Walking with God are through the days of nothingness then neither hot nor cold they're neither good nor bad they just to her I just woke up I just made it to another day what you doing nothing you know what you doing now this stuff just stuff I gotta do can I stay with God through days of nothingness 18 years at our obscure from us where Jesus is just so no name Carpenter's Son Moving about growing up from 12 to 30 years old in total obscurity he doesn't pick up again until this new highly successful and accomplished disruptive thinking John I call him a disrupter because he broke all of his father's rules and won doing it he didn't dress like a priest he didn't eat like a priest he didn't function in the synagogue he was in the wilderness eating wild locusts and honey and dressed in Camel's hair don't be scared to be different different does not disannull greatness in fact it actually confirms greatness nobody writes books about ordinary go to the library you won't see any books written about people who weren't disruptive or in some way extraordinary and you have to understand that and realize that Jesus was 18 years that we know nothing about and then at 30 years old he's in the crowd not on the stage he's in the crowd not on the program he's in the back row of the crowd coming to hear his cousin John and he comes down to the Jordan and all the eyes are on John and none of them are on Jesus because John the Baptist was a new hot thing and you know how we love the new hot thing I tell young preachers when you start a church you're only new ones you only knew one so why you knew you might as well Rockets rocket go all the way with it because as soon as people get used to you they start taking you for granted oh I won't go this week I'll go next week I'll check it out later I'll take it out online if I get to it I'll come to it that's what happens in any relationship familiarity breeds contempt if you want to stay fresh stay back because if you're overexpose yourself no matter how good you are at what you do people get used to you you can sing the pain off the wall but if you sing all the time they get used to your riffs and runs and the person they shouted about today they ignore tomorrow you can be the greatest wife in the world and celebrate it for the first few years but after a while they get used to it and they want to know are there any new tricks so save some [Applause] don't fit everything on the first week Hallelujah come on somebody don't fit everything in the first week don't tell everything in the first week because you got to keep it fresh you got to update you got to remain interesting you gotta keep reading you gotta keep developing yourself because once people get used to you they walk past you they ignore you they walk past Jesus to get to John because John was the new thing and he was bad and he was disruptive and he was dressed different and he would you know and they was coming to hear him and to check him out and while John is baptizing in the Jordan nobody is talking about Jesus you better go make some shoes somewhere make a table a chair somewhere push your passion Jesus trying to get to John often we push past the greater trying to get to the lesson because it takes time to fulfill to reveal greatness and when time has not exposed who you really are people sub you to the side trying to get to something that is less than what's down inside of you and you got to be okay with it because that's the test too obscurity is a test too being ignored is a test too being treated as ordinary as a test too to make sure that your ego is low enough that when God exalts you you won't start worshiping yourself he'll let people push past you and say how you like me now because he doesn't want you to be ego driven he wants you to be spirit-led and you can't be Spirit Led and ego driven so God allows people to walk past you can you imagine walking past the water walking Jesus can you imagine walking past the dead raising Jesus can you imagine walking past the Jesus who turned water in there why can you imagine who you might have walked past this morning and Jesus does not stop them from walking past him he doesn't whip out his business cards he doesn't start doing Sideshow miracles to get on their itinerary I like him because he got class there's a difference between education and class there's a difference between money and class they're the difference between a great vocabulary and class I'm not sure you can teach class Jesus class makes you handle rejection class makes you handle not being celebrated class won't let you just do anything to get on the itinerary because you think too much of yourself to lower yourself down to make yourself a trap for somebody just so you can get their attention class will make you wait class will make you a hug a pillar class will make you roll over by yourself has to make you hold your head up when other people are ignoring your class will make you sit back and let them take somebody listen to the day class Jesus had absolute class oh my god I think I'm still on the road I feel like preaching up in here if y'all mess with me this morning it's going to be Church up in this place I feel something flowing up in this place right now I want to celebrate all the people who have kept their class it wasn't that you wasn't lonely but you kept your class it wasn't that you weren't quite apartment in Columbia class and what that God wasn't going to use you in a mighty way but your hell a to your integrity job your library thing but he held on two years Integrity without your integrity you got nothing that your integrity is determined by What You Won't Do there are some things that I'm just not gonna do I'm just not gonna do that I'm just not gonna do that if I go broke I'm not gonna do that if I could sell the car not gonna do that if I have to sell the shoes I'm not gonna do it I just not gonna do it right because I think too much of myself you don't know me but he does and all of a sudden John the Baptist looks up with his feet standing in the Jordan River in the same Jordan River that Joshua's feet had stood in the same Jordan that went hither and dither and the children of Israel had walked across on dry ground John is standing in that same Jordan the same Jordan where they took out the 12 smooth Stones where the feet of the priesthood firm John is now standing in that same Jordan only it stood up him pulling out a rock he's about to reveal The Rock The Rock of Ages The Rock in a weary land the rocks in a sure place I'm talking about Jesus everybody's looking at John but John looks up and he sees Jesus [Applause] and how you manage greatness has a lot to do with how you end up [Applause] a lot of people will not shine a light on anybody who might make them look less let me hear some John says behold don't keep looking at me behold there's something greater than me behold the one you walk past behold the one you overlook behold the one you ignored he is the Lamb of God will take you the way the sins of the world and the Bible says the crowd Parts Jesus goes from obscurity to notoriety in a step you think it's Gonna Take Years you just gonna step into what God has just just just the steps already been ordered don't worry about the stage pray for the step if you make this step the stage will take care of itself too many people are in love with the stage and not the steps so they get on the stage and can't stay on it because they don't take the steps to qualify them for the state don't pray for the stage pray for the step the stats of a good man are ordered by the Lord and He delighted in his way I feel something in this place I feel something in this place something's about to break loose in this place [Applause]"

that just wants to throw confusion and darkness into society into this country has come upon us now I mean we have this all gender bathroom imagine being a woman walking out of the stall just to see a guy right at the sink uh just I mean what guys are going to just be perverting up in there just throwing things and messing things up I mean this is evil not only that we have these laws being proposed that really tell teachers to hide from the students what's going on and hide from the students parents what's going on with her gender identity you can see this trans teacher was advocating to basically be able to hide truth from the parents of the students basically if you have a student and also I know this in my own hometown of Harrisonburg Virginia they've had some really shady things going on basically where students might be expressing some confusion or some thoughts about gender or I don't know they want to identify as a penguin I don't know it could be whatever right and so there's this shadiness that's going on they're making these laws where the teachers aren't supposed to tell the parents now and the parents are just I guess supposed to be kept out of the loop because the parents could be transphobic because the parents could be hateful so to speak I mean this is just absurd it's like we've given away the public school system to exactly what Satan wants to do really we've just gotten to the point but I believe God wants to speak to you here in this video we have a vision we have a destiny that we've got to get done because if we want our country to be saved we're on our last round and we have to take the step up we have to be bold and Proclaim his name the Bible says in Isaiah chapter 61 that Darkness would come upon the face of the Earth but that great light would shine even in the midst of it and I believe why you should stick around to the end of this episode is because God wants to encourage you today God wants to give you this truth that greater is he that is living in you than he that is in the world and whatever opposition or place of influence that you are currently in whether it's your job your family your friends maybe you have a family member who's gone off and been confused and gone into darkness we need to come at this from the first place which is love love himself lives inside of us the only way we're going to save our country is not by just criticizing the confusion and everybody struggling and just criticizing them and just talking down on them instead we've got to choose love we've got to judge ourselves first now can I sit here and and talk about how homosexuality is wrong yes but can I just judge any person that is sexually sinned before and just say that they're horrible and they're going to hell and that I'm just so much better than them absolutely not because I've made mistakes before in my life too right it's the grace of God that I stand here it's by the love of God that I've come into His presence and into his throne and he's watched me redeem me and set me free right but so that's just the first step that we need to come into this with love and by the way keep on sticking around to the incentive episode because you're not going to want to miss the prayer I'm going to pray for you soon here and you know what the Bible says when when the greater one lives inside of us we are joined in life Union with him it's so important that you speak Words of Life over yourself it's so weird to me how in today's society we're trained to speak words of death we're trained to even say jokes and memes and stuff like that like oh aha so funny I'm dead I'm dead laughing so hard and I know that's just like a joke right that's just like a funny thing but my point here is that our language has become so unmeaningless that we just say whatever word we want it and then change how we want it to mean and then all of a sudden it's good right and and so but not only that but we say serious things of death as well we take doctors reports and then seek think that exactly what the doctor said is going to happen and we're just going to die or we're just going to follow ale or our economy is broken and the inflation's horrible so my finances are bad stop speaking that over yourself you're speaking fear instead speak Faith you know in every single situation in my life I remember before I moved to Bible College I wasn't financially doing that good I was making barely any money and I wasn't looking like I was perfect but I knew I was going to get my college paid for and I said God is helping me I am smart I know how to do the books I know how to work God Is providing for all my needs right did it look like that all the time no I was having Dad I was struggling right but God sure enough came on my behalf and helped me with college I got scholarships and then he paid for my thing now at the same time when I moved to college I was living in a trailer it didn't look great right I was kind of struggling to pay all my bills but I knew that God was my source and I started speaking life so I just encourage you speak life and not death because if we're gonna change anything in this country we need to start speaking what heaven says say you have a cousin or fan family member or someone that has just gone off in the world and they're really struggling and they're really not living for God at all well don't just look at them with a bunch of Shame and contempt and just a bunch of hate but instead look at them and bless them and love them and Speak Life over them and speak well about them when you're talking about them to others speak well about them and yeah I get it that people make mistakes and I get it people are down sometimes and full of Darkness but they're just deceived it's always best the Bible says love believes the best of others even when it doesn't look great even when things aren't all working out speak what heaven says speak God's love over them and that's really going to help us in this time and then this season and you know right now I'm sitting in a car right it's getting warm right and I'm being overcome by this Texas heat but in in our in our life a lot of times we feel that we're just overcome by everything that's around us but the real thing is if I had an ice pack on the inside of my shirt right now I would be doing just fine even though it would be so hot around me if I had ice all over me I'll be doing just fine I'll be chilling right why because it's yes you will face horrible situation in your life yes you are going through some crazy opposition and if you're not going through some crazy opposition get ready because it might just be coming your way and you need to be ready for it right and in an economy in a nation where things are just going more down we have a president who's just become a joke we have schools and public schools and taxes that have just increased and public schools that have just gone astray and drag queens performing while the Bible studies are kicked out right and we have all this confusion we can get into a complaining mindset of just oh everything around me so horrible or we can remind ourselves who we are in Christ there's an amazing scripture the Bible says in Colossians chapter 3 it says do not set your mind on the Earthly things don't be distracted with what the Earth says concerning you but instead think on Heavenly mindset set your mind on what heaven says why what does that mean well we got to remember this Earth our feelings our thoughts the way things look like are just temporary they're going to fade we remind ourselves what God says about us again I just encourage you to speak words of life and that's how we're going to start right now wherever you are just pray these words after me Father God I thank you for saving me forgiving me washing me in your blood Jesus thank you you are great and you live inside me nothing can stop the Christ in me I am valued precious chosen not forgotten not forsaken in Jesus name amen amen that'll help you overcome all your insecurities is look at yourself in the mirror every single day and say what God says about you and you feel that you're not in shape you feel that you don't have the perfect job you feel that you're not making enough money um you know something really big I just want to touch on finances real quick is the principle of sowing and reaping and also tithe is the way to get set free from the worldly system now I'm not telling you this to manipulate you into giving to a church or giving to a Ministry or or even just giving to me I I'm not here to get your money I'm here to provide truth that will set you free and you know when I learned the principle of sewing and reaping and you know the tithe people complain about like oh tithe that's 10 that's a lot of money like I don't know if I have that like I don't know if I can really give that well let me ask you this right all the rest of our money we spend it towards food and rent and clothes and shoes and Crocs and cars and all these things right 200 years from now you'll have absolutely none of those things but what will you have you will have your Eternal your spiritual acts towards other people right the way you got the gospel out you will be rewarded in heaven forever for those things why well what do you learn from that well it's time we invest in eternity it's time we invest in spiritual things right and the more we invest in that now I'm not telling you this to just say if 100 of your money to a church and then not have closer food because guess what happens when you see God's kingdom first and when you just give him a little bit of 10 I mean we think about it we give Joe Biden 30 how much more can we give God just a little bit of our 10 right and uh when you see God first with that tithe it's not just about also it's not specifically about 10 I don't I don't believe in the tithe that says you have to give a certain amount I believe in first the tithe of the heart meaning first how are you spending your time so this isn't necessarily just about money this is about time this is about resources right how are you spending your heart and second if you have a job or if you if you don't have a job go get a job go pick weeds never make excuses I had a job when I was nine years old I'm so tired of people saying oh I'm too young I don't have a job no go get a job don't make excuses go walk around to your neighbors and offer to clean their houses and they'll pay you and then just take 10 of that and give it to God and it's it doesn't have to be 10 it could be 15 20 25 I mean whatever is on your heart right but it allows God to bless the 90 because let me tell you you have much more valuable things when God blesses 90 compared to uh you trying to bless a hundred on your own it doesn't make sense why I financially able to pay my bills but yet somehow God supplies because he's taught me the the laws of sewing reaping also with sewing and reaping giving to others is a huge way that you can reap what God has but you don't give to get you don't give to try to like get this thing back to yourself you just give because you love you just give because God loves so I challenge you give to somebody today go watch the dishes for somebody today go go hang out with someone today and just care for them ask them how their days going learn about them and learn how you can bless them and uh find a Ministry find a church I'm not telling you that you've got to give to my Ministry and and then you'll be blessed no but I will tell you that gift where God has called you to and if you believe in this Channel and if you want to help us reach more people and if you want to help

      "corpus": "what's going on my name is Will and I have the honor and the privilege as serving as one of the leaders here at Transformation Church I just want to say thank you so much for tuning in from wherever you are watching from and if you haven't already be sure to like And subscribe we believe that God has such an incredible word for you today so let's jump into this amazing message thank you I would ask that you remain standing for the reading of God's word it does have a 90s feel in here so I'm going to have a 90s Cadence and the church I was raised in we stood for the reading of God's word we reverenced God's word and on my last assignment in this series I draw your attention to the Book of Luke chapter number 15. The Gospel According to Luke chapter number 15. so familiar passage of scripture I'm sure if you have not read it you've heard about it but one thing about God's word is that it is ever speaking it is the only book that is alive it is the only book that is breathing it is the only book that as you open it it opens you [Music] read it it reads you so I'm reading from the New Living Translation of the Bible starting at the 11th verse here's what it says to illustrate the point further Jesus is talking to uh some religious leaders who have a problem with him associating with sinful people what's interesting about their allegation against Jesus in this episode this chapter is that these Sinners were coming to hear Jesus teach he wasn't at the club with them he wasn't out drinking with them he wasn't hanging out at a bar his message happened to be so compelling that Sinners wanted to hear more and the religious leaders indicted him because of who he was drawing to him they wanted a message that would only draw the elite this was drawing those from the streets they had an issue with it so Jesus gives three Parables one about the lost sheep one about the Lost coin and then he starts off on this one to illustrate the point further Jesus told them this story a man had two sons the younger son told his father I want my share of your estate now before you die so his father agreed to divide his wealth between his sons a few days later this younger son packed all his belongings and moved to a distant land and there he wasted all his money and while living about the time his money ran out a Great Famine swept over the land and he began to starve he persuaded a local farmer to hire him and the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs the young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs looked good to him but no one gave him anything when he finally came to his senses he said to himself at home even the higher servants have enough food to spare and here I am dying of hunger I will go home to my father and say father I have sinned against both heaven and you and I am no longer worthy of being called your son please take me on as his hired servant so he returned home to his father and while he was still a long way off his father saw him coming filled with love and compassion he ran to his son embraced him and kissed him his son said to him father I have sinned against both heaven and you and I am no longer worthy of being called your son but his father said to the servants quick bring the finest robe in the house and put it on them get a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet and kill the calf we have been fattening we must celebrate with the feast for this son of mine was dead and has now returned to life he was lost but now he is found so the party began meanwhile the older son was in the fields working when he returned home he heard music and dancing in the house and he asked one of the servants what was going on your brother is back he was told and your father has killed the fatted calf we are celebrating because of his safe return [Music] the older brother was angry and wouldn't go in his father came out and begged him and but he replied all these years I have slaves for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told me to and in all that time you never gave even one young goat for a feast with my friends yet when this son of yours comes back after squandering your money on prostitutes you celebrate by killing the fatted calf [Music] his father said to him look dear son you have always stayed by me and everything I have is yours we had to celebrate this happy day for your brother was dead and has come back to life he was lost but now he is found it is my assignment to preach to you from the subject today the numb one I just want to talk to you about the numb one bow your heads let's pray over the word shall we Holy Spirit unnamed us amen you may be seated in the presence of the Lord Jesus has such a unique calling in the three and a half years of his Earthly Ministry it is absolutely profound that a life this short could have this type of impact I am currently 47 almost 48 years old yet in the life of Jesus that only lasted 33 and a half years with only three and a half years of that 33 and a half being Ministry we are still talking about it right now I am grateful for the role that I currently play in the body of Christ but I am certain that after about a hundred years no one will be mentioning my name maybe there's a few books that I'll write that somebody will find and that will give me a few more years in the theater of people's imaginations but I would imagine after a few decades my name will be mentioned no more yet here we have Jesus in a life so short and over 2 000 years later is this all we can talk about over two thousand years later this is why we still gather over 2 000 years later this is why we still worship through pestilence and persecution we still find a way to gather to worship the king of kings and of Lord of lords because his life ain't my life and it's not yours the life he lived was the most expensive life that has ever been she is on assignment through Luke's writing we find him on an assignment and his assignment to go after the lost sheep of Israel is absolutely compelling the first Messianic prophecy given with promise is in Genesis 3 15 the seat of the woman shall bruised ahead of the serpent and he shall bruise it's healed it's been four thousand years since that prophecy he finally comes on the scene 30 years in obscurity burst into the public square and starts to preach a message that doesn't draw the elite does not draw the academics it does not draw those that have the intellectual rigor of Higher Learning he draws Street people unscrupulous uncouth despised scandalous lion cheating promiscuous treat people I'm talking about the type of people that you don't see during the day for all of their activities really take place and manifest in the night they they don't have time for the day it's too light in the day it's too bright in the day so we don't even start our activities until dusk we don't get dressed until eight we need a house at 10. and like vampires we are in by 5 30. because we are not children of the light we're Children of the dark but his message was bringing people out by the droves smelling like weed still hungover still smelling like sex I don't know what it smelled like to you but it has a smell these are the people that were coming to hear from Jesus and as these people kept gathering around it began to agitate the religious they hated to see who was coming to church as much as they wanted to compel people to become Jews they they started to get bothered by the type of people that they saw coming into the church they weren't wearing suits they weren't wearing ties they didn't have on the right garments they didn't know where to sit they didn't know the protocol they didn't know to lift their hands in worship they didn't know not to talk during the sermon they they didn't know the protocols the procedures the politics all they knew was this dude is so compelling I want to learn more I just got to stop and say that I'm so grateful for a god uh who would not put a dress code on the house but would allow anybody in no matter what they've been dealing with no matter how long they've been dealing with it I'm grateful for a God that did not have a list of things before you walked into his presence he said however you are come on in I'll take you right where you are just like you are I don't care why you are just come the religious leaders are so pissed so pissed that if you're religious you're mad I just said pissed [Applause] they were so pissed off that they began to judge people who wanted to change [Applause] foreign I want them to change but not her I want them to change but not yeah ew look at them disgusting we need them to change before they change [Applause] her shirt is too school to her her skirt is too short we need her to change before she changes his pants are sagging we need him to change before he changes he got earrings all through his ear and a ring nose and a tongue ring we need him to change before he changes and [Applause] they wanted him clean on the outside so Jesus gives these parables one about the lost sheep that the shepherd would leave the 99 and go after the one the second one was about a woman who lost a coin who swept the house so feverishly until she found the coin that when she got it back she called all her neighbors and told him and the religious leaders are listening to the words that are coming out of Jesus's mouth and feeling good about themselves that's right those dumb lost sheep can't believe they left stupid deconstructionists left the church can't believe them yeah you write amen preacher preach that parable of the lost coin yeah how careless can you be losing stuff [Music] can't believe people that lose coins and lose Keys amen they're irresponsible preach preacher and then he says there was a man that had two sons and the younger son went to his father and asked for his inheritance now the first person audience would have been so compelled by this story because in Jewish culture for uh for any son to ask for his father's inheritance was literally to say to his father you ain't dead yet [Music] why are you still here why don't you die already the father was built so different that when the younger son asked for his inheritance even though this was one of the most disrespectful things that any Jewish young man could say to his father the father devised his inheritance and gives the younger son what he would have got when he died the youngest son a few days later packs all his stuff and leaves his father's house you can't get any number than this you actually can't get any dumber than this but you know you have to be a numb soul to look at your father through eyes of acrimony through eyes of complacency to say I don't even want to be in your presence anymore you would have nothing if it wasn't for the father and now you actually think you can be something without him he packs all of this stuff and gold scripture says to a far away land sets up some type of life for himself but outside of his father's presence he does not know how to Steward the money he was given and because his heart was numb he began to squander the money that's what prodigal means it just means to waste he went out there and just started spending money on everything his brother dropped a dime and let us know he frequented prostitutes he was just out there letting it go and as we would all expect to happen he let all that money go until he was broke now as long as he had resources he had women as long as he had resources he had friends Proverbs lets us know that everybody is the friend of a generous person you really don't know who your friends really are until you have nothing to give them [Applause] oh most people that think they have a friend only have a transaction most people that think they have friends only have an arrangement very few of us have friends that if you lost it all I must still be here if you gain it all imma still be here if you have reputation I'll be here if you don't have a reputation I will still be here the young son thought that he had more than he did and he realized when he lost everything that there was no one around he thought he had risk until the money went away and he realized they were only there for what he had not for who he was famine hits the land the resources have dried up now the land has dried up and he is forced to get a job something he didn't have to have in his daddy's house he had to go get a job a wealthy Jewish young man had to go get a job in Gentile territory you know how disrespectful this episode is and he has to go to somebody and go okay uh sir ah can I have a job and the guy was like well yeah I'll give you some wages if you feed my pigs may I remind you this is a Jewish dude he didn't get a job managing the house he didn't get a job managing uh the Affairs of the homeowner he was assigned to the pigs he never saw a pig where he lived because Jews don't fool with pigs so he has to go out there and feed the pigs and he's throwing out these pods for these pigs to eat and the famine had been so excruciating that as she was throwing out the pots he started Desiring them that looks tasty you know what happens when you hit rock bottom you feed off anything you know what happens when you lose all your resources you start becoming so desperate you will connect to anything you will identify with anything you will align with anything he's throwing out food to the pigs and then going oh he's living out here feeding pigs this is his job he did not expect when he left his father's presence to be feeding pigs but this is what numbness would do to you it will take you further than you ever expected to go because sin never stays where you put it [Applause] I'm in my bag today sin never stays where you put it you think they just slept over for the weekend and it's now six months later baby y'all live together two years from now you might as well just be common law married you thought it was just a night it has now turned into a nightmare [Applause] help me preach I love a person so down then they can finish the sentence help me preach yo Knight has turned into a night [Music] he thought when he left the house I can't wait to be on my own I can't wait to do my own thing I cannot wait to manage my own money I cannot wait to sleep with whoever I want I cannot wait to do whatever I want and he got what he wanted but now he does not want what he got [Applause] oh my God he is in a pig pen numb with some pigs numb feeding pods to pigs and without the benefit of a worship song without the magical oratorical ability of a homiletic sermon scripture says as numb as he was in the middle of this pigsty he came to his senses I don't know who I'm preaching to today but but there's somebody in here that is coming to their senses you you have been in a horrible situation but you are now starting to come to your senses King James said he came to himself he he he something started to happen I believe that what was numb started to waste away and he started to get his feeling back there was no sermon preached there was no altar call given but he started to get his senses back he started feeling again it dawned on him that that where he was he would never be if he was in his father's house it dawned on him that where he currently was his father would never put him in a situation like that and that boy started coming foreign he came to his senses [Music] foreign I resonate with this boy because on January 14th of 1996 I came to my senses sitting on the back row of my parents church a rented out banquet room in a bowling alley after Sunday school morning worship had just started I had just came in from the club at 5 30 in the morning on the back row of that uh banquet room I came to my census the Holy Spirit told me that I was a sinner and I felt my disconnection from God as father and I came to my senses this was a Pentecostal church and so I was at least three hours away from an altar call but but I knew right then and there I could not wait for the sermon and I could not wait for the article so when testimony service broke out I stood up at the back and waited for them to go through all them long testimonies so that I could just say I give up those were literally my exact three words when my daddy said I think Tim has something to say I give up [Applause] my filling had come back I knew I was separated from the father a sermon didn't tell me that a song did not tell me that the Holy Spirit himself drew me back to the father I came I came to myself this boy came to himself and he said if I was back in my daddy's house even after all I've done I bet he'd give me a job and at least there'd be no pigs around whatever he told me to do would be more dignified than this he said I'm gonna go home I ain't got to stay here this what happens when you know you got a loving daddy I'm talking to somebody in this building this what happens when you know that you have a loving God and not someone that is going to judge you not someone that is going to condemn you but somebody that is going to receive you with open arms when you really get unnamed you start to understand my daddy's not as mean as I thought he was he is not as bad as I thought he was he was protecting me no wonder he'll ever let me go out to where I wanted to go out he wasn't being mean to me he wasn't restricting me he was protecting [Applause] that boy started rehearsing his apology Dear Daddy [Applause] I have been a plum fool should have never left your house she never spent your money and I know that I don't even deserve to come back uh I will take the role of a servant even you probably don't even want me as a son no more but I will be a servant Dear Daddy I have been a plum fool you probably don't even want me back but uh if it can't be your son I'm gonna be your servant Dear Daddy I have been a plum fool you probably don't even want me back even though I can't be your son maybe I can just be your servant Dear Daddy I know I have been a fool you probably don't even want me back but if I can't be your son at least I could be your servant Dear Daddy this is true repentance [Music] true repentance is when you don't make it about anything else except you against you and you only sir have I sinned I'm not gonna Gaslight it I'm not gonna say well you were so restrictive and if you'd have let me do something when I was 14 then I wouldn't have done it no no no when you truly repent you don't make excuses you put it all on you God I'm the one it is me standing in the need of prayer it is me that needs your healing it is me that needs your touch it is me that needs to be healed it is me [Applause] I feel like preaching now he he he started walking home dear daddy Dear Daddy I have been a plum fool you probably don't even want me to be your son maybe I could just be your servant Dear Daddy I have been a plum fool you probably don't even want my want me to be your son at least I could be your servant Dear Daddy I have been a plum fool and he was rehearsing his repentance all the way back home he was walking home repentant I hope he accepts my apology cause I'm coming home I don't know what role I'll have in the house but I don't even care I am coming home I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God ah [Applause] I'm coming home I'm coming home I'm coming home I'm coming home I'm coming home I'm home I'm coming home I'm coming home I'm coming I'm prophesying now because somebody's coming home you're coming home you're coming home you coming home you ain't gonna be numb no more you coming home you coming home somebody's watching online right now and your feeling is coming back even as I'm talking tears are beginning to come out of your eyes you know why you are coming home [Applause] walking home and has no idea that his daddy [Applause] his daddy has been looking for this boy [Applause] since he left listen to me hear me he didn't search for the boy hear me he didn't search for him but he did look for him Parable the lost sheep God does go after those that are lost but he does not go after those that left you're gonna have to sing Reckless Love a little bit differently now I'm so sorry I'm so sorry he does go after who gets lost but he does not go after who left you willfully left he ain't chasing you he gives you free will you can do exactly what you want you can walk out of this door right now and never come back that he's not going to chase you [Applause] [Music] that good old daddy just kept on waiting at that porch I don't see him I don't see him yet I don't see him I'm gonna keep on praying keep on praying God bring him back bring them back bring them back bring them back bring them back bring them back that's my son sleeping with prostitutes that's my son in a pig pen that's my son smelling like weed that's my son high off cocaine that's my son teeth blowed out of his mouth cause of meth that's my son trunk off of beer that's my son heroin needle in his arm that's my son [Applause] at a distance this is a good daddy at a distance he can see his son he has taken note of the Gate of his walk and before he can get close the father does something as undignified as the sun he runs old men and Jewish culture did not run it was an undignified thing to do but he saw his son a far off and the old man lifted up his garments and spread it for his son now you must understand the significance in Jewish culture this boy has disrespected not only his father but the entire Village he was open season for punishment backed by Old Testament law that if a son that has been this disgraceful to his father and the entire Village can be stoned on sight so his daddy sprinting out to meet him where he was was not just an act of love it was also an act of protection if you gonna throw a rock you not just gonna hit him you're gonna have to hit me you say something about my son you better say something about me you about to come after him you're gonna have to come after me you were my child you must want me guys she ran out of Medicine [Music] [Applause] he ran out and met his son and that boy who have been rehearsing his repentance story [Applause] opened up his mouth Dear Daddy I know I've been a plum fool before he can say his next word status said shut up go get my roll [Music] but Daddy I haven't finished repenting yet go get my ring but daddy I'm trying to tell you how bad I've been go get my sandals but Daddy I haven't told you what I did yet go get me a fatty calf but Daddy I'm just trying to tell you shut up you think I needed to hear your words to know you repented I knew you repented when I saw you coming down I'm trying to tell somebody in this room the only thing you need to do is start walking back towards your father and God himself knows that before you open your mouth he knew there was a change in your heart come on he didn't even let him finish repenting before he could get back in the house good he got on his daddy's robe his daddy's ring and his daddy shoes you talk about restoration he said you ain't even got to take a shower you still smell like pigs I don't even care put on my robe put on my ring put on my shoes you're not numb anymore you can feel again which means you can heal again I know I could kill you instead I'ma kill this calf [Applause] talk about Jesus speaking in code to some people that didn't even understand what he was about to do oh there will be a death today son it just won't be yours oh somebody gonna die today it just won't be you somebody's gonna pay for this but it doesn't have to be you kill the fatty calf [Music] yeah it's a party everybody [Music] he back he back he back in this house he back he back he back in his house he back who that that son he back in this house and while they're all partying the oldest son is outside and he hears celebration he hears music he hears shouts of joy and he asked one of the servants who what's going on what everybody what is everybody cheering about they were like your brother just came back your brother just came back your Father's son is back foreign instead of rejoicing like the father in the service the older brother was pissed [Music] and he's so pissed off he won't go in the house [Music] with all this celebration going on the older brother won't even come in the house the daddy is skipping around high-fiving everybody hugging his son then he's looking for his other one we're here sir he he's outside he hasn't come in [Music] I ain't going in the house what you killed the fatted calf for him [Music] strongest implication is you shouldn't have wasted your sacrifice on that I have never left this house I have always done what you told me to do I've never complained [Music] and you haven't killed even a goat for me oh but you're gonna kill a fatted calf for him [Music] remember what I told you the title of this message was the number one ladies and gentlemen I submit to you it was not the prodigal [Music] that was numb because scripture told us all he came back to him since to his senses he's not the number one in this story the older

done nothing outwardly but have the nerve to think you have done nothing inwardly thank you [Music] the young son spent his money on prostitutes the oldest son spent his time offended the younger the younger son squandered his money on frivolous thing the older son squandered his time on Petty things the other son said [Music] I've done everything you asked you've never given me nothing and the father I can't even imagine what the father is thinking at this point bro I divided the money you're the oldest son so that means you get a double portion of everything your brother squandered

listen listen the young son went far away came to his senses and came back the old son was right outside the house and couldn't bring his himself to even walk a few feet indoors you don't have to be far away from God to be disconnected from God you don't have to be 20 miles away to be disconnected from God you can be two feet outside of the church and be a thousand miles away spiritually don't be the number one it's not worth it don't be the numb one okay so here's how we're gonna do this article [Music] if you've been numb and you don't want to be numb no mo I just want you to come down to the altar I don't do like fancy altar calls so you ain't getting like your favorite song played and all that stuff [Music] if this message was for you come I've been numb and I don't want to be numb

numb no more I need to feel again I need to heal again I need to be real again I can't live my life like this I need to get my sensitivity back [Music] I can't be sleep to the things of God I can't be numb to the things of God I've got to be sensitive to the move of God and I can only do that if I come to my senses I can only do that if I have control of my sins come on push in push in push in I think we all got a good deodorant come on come on from wherever you are just come just come just come I love to see it I love to see it this is a beautiful thing I'm telling you this is a beautiful thing to see it's a beautiful thing to see you're gonna get your feeling back you're going to get your feeling back you don't have to stay like this anymore [Music] no matter what you've rehearsed to say to God before you can finish he's ready to clothe you in righteousness he's ready to cover you in Grace he's ready to give you his Spirit he's ready to heal you from the inside out so just come I'll wait for you even if you're coming out of the highest rafter I'll wait for you just come we're going to feel again as a family we're gonna feel again as a family [Music] I want to pray for you I'm not going to lead you in a prayer I'm just going to pray for you but while I'm praying you can just talk to God however you want to talk to him for the last 27 years as a disciple of Jesus Christ the one thing that I've never wanted to lose is my sensitivity and there's been a lot of things to try to take my sensitivity low self-esteem Pride [Music] porn promiscuity [Music] anger bitterness holding a grudge unforgiveness there's been a lot of stuff that's tried to make me numb but I never want to feel what I felt on January 14th and 96 I never want that feeling again I don't want to feel disconnected from my dad [Music] so even if I feel some of me falling asleep if I'm gonna fall asleep I'm gonna do it in my father's house I am not going to disconnect myself from the church I am not going to disc myself disconnect myself from Community thank you Holy Spirit there's some people in here you've experienced Church hurt if that's you if that's why you're numb please raise your hand thank you thank you for your honesty the reason why I've been numb is because I was hurt I was hurt in church let's let's shift the perspective so that you can get healed okay Church didn't hurt you somebody in the church did [Applause] [Music] I need to I need to give you that adjustment the church didn't hurt you somebody in the church did and here's a crazy thing you got hurt in church and maybe you can't go back to that church but you won't experience healing until you're back in church so some people in a church hurt you it's going to be some people in a church that heal you and all you got to do is give God permission to work through some different people maybe you can't trust again but you can have faith again and faith is to prerequisite to a relationship with God not trust [Music] the scriptures do not say without trust is it impossible to please him says without faith [Music] so would you just lift your hands however you feel comfortable God thank you so much for my brothers and sisters your sons and daughters thank you Lord God that you are bringing our sensitivity back thank you Lord God that you are bringing our senses back you've brought us back to our senses God we repent for being the younger son who went far away from you and squandered a lot thank you for receiving us back God we repent for being the older son who never left the house but spent all of our time judging those that left God I'm no better than them and they are no better than us we are both in need of your forgiveness and we both need to be in your house we both need to be in your presence so God I thank you that what you do in this moment right now is miraculous what you do in this moment right now is restorative what you do in this moment right now is healing what you do in this moment right now is radical what you do in this moment right now is Deliverance God thank you for unnumbing us so that we can fill again thank you for bringing us home from the pig pen and from

      "corpus": "- [Mark] Rachel? - Yes. - [Mark] You're homeless in San Diego? - Yes, I am. - [Mark] Tell me about it. - Homelessness is the hardest job I've ever had. You only have two, 24-hour bathrooms in San Diego. There's no 24-hour showers. They want us to work. Some of us can't work. And the ones that can cannot get clean. If it wasn't for EBT, we wouldn't know when our next meals are coming except for when they do the feedings out here. - [Mark] So when you say they want you to work, what do you mean by that? - They want you to be employed. They want you to be productive members of society. - [Mark] You mean the public? - The public. - [Mark] Right. - The officials. - [Mark] Right. - The powers to be. - [Mark] Well, how do you keep employment when you don't have showers? - You can't. - [Mark] And- - You can't go to school. You can't do anything without a shower because you don't, you're embarrassed. - [Mark] Right. And you're standing in front of your tent. - Yes, I am. - [Mark] How do you lock it? - I have a lock that I lock it with. - [Mark] Oh, you were able to lock your tent? - Yes, I am. - [Mark] But still, it's canvas and- - Oh, yes. - [Mark] You know when you go to work, I mean, people don't understand all the roadblocks. Getting a job isn't so hard. It's maintaining a job. - Yes, it is. - [Mark] You know? And we're gonna have a train going by. What? Let's... How do you guys sleep here? - The trains stop running at one o'clock in the morning. They don't start again until four. At night, (siren wailing) it's actually relatively quiet under the bridge, - [Mark] Yeah. - other than the trains. And I sleep better out here. - [Mark] Yeah. - Than I did in a shelter. - [Mark] Right. - Any of the shelters I've been in. - [Mark] Well, let's keep on the work thing a little bit because, so, how young are you? - I am 55. - [Mark] Right. And you know, ageism is very real. Finding a job as an older adult is challenging. - Yes, it is. - [Mark] And you know, being homeless, people don't understand there's no job that you're gonna get that's gonna be able to pay for you to get an apartment. - You don't make enough money out here. - [Mark] Right. - You have to have three jobs. - [Mark] Yeah, and you know, they don't understand how poverty is expensive. You don't have refrigeration. - No. - [Mark] So you can't store food to cut costs. - No. - [Mark] Anyways, what we need to do is get people like you, who may be willing to work, into housing- - So we can work, and be clean, and not be embarrassed, and have our dignity. - [Mark] Yeah. Exactly. So you told us earlier you don't do drugs. - No. I don't drink. I don't even smoke weed. - [Mark] So, how did you end up homeless? - Circumstances and happenstances. It was over 10 years ago, and bad choices. I used to do drugs, I'll be honest about that. Yeah. But, not anymore. - [Mark] I'm the same way. I have 28 years sober. And even still, you know, everybody makes bad choices. If homelessness was a punishment for bad choices, we'd all be homeless. - Exactly. Just because you have a door you can lock doesn't mean that you're a cream of the crop and an angel, that's for sure 'cause people do more dirt than they do out on the streets, behind a locked door. - [Mark] Yeah, well that's one of the things because I spend a lot of time in homeless camps that I've noticed is that it's just like being in the suburbs. You know, you have people that are nice, and people that are - Not nice. (chuckles) - [Mark] not so nice. And then, you know, people that are angry, and yelling, and people doing drugs, and whatever. You don't see it because they're behind walls. - Yep. - [Mark] And you guys are living out in the open. It's crazy. - Yes, it is. And not everybody is mentally ill that's out here. Some of it's drug induced, and some of it is mental illness. - [Mark] Yeah, well it's extremely hard to do homeless sober, so. - Yes, it is. - [Mark] Huge props to you. I don't judge anybody that's out here, you know, using because they gotta cope with the trauma. - Yes. It's very hard. - [Mark] Yeah, so- - It's very hard. And lo and behold, even in the shelters, there's a lotta drug use. I'd say just as much as out on the streets. And you even have employees of shelters that sell clients drugs. - [Mark] Speaking of trauma, today you had to move all your stuff across the street. - Yes. - [Mark] And then back. - Yes. - [Mark] Because the city comes through and does homeless sweeps. And if you don't move your stuff, they take it all. - Yes. They take it all. And they're supposed to go through it and keep whatever they would think is valuable to you, but they don't do that. I've watched them throw away a plethora of people's stuff and their tents, and everything they own, and not search a thing. - [Mark] Tell me about the criminalization of homelessness here in San Diego. - It's all about the almighty dollar. That's what it boils down to. They wanna make their money by criminalizing the homeless because we're an easy target. - [Mark] And what do you mean by that? So what, from my understanding, a lot of people that live in this camp once lived downtown and that they were pushed here, and you know the criminalization, they don't give you any place to go. - No, they don't. There is only 1700 some odd shelter beds, and there's more than 25-plus hundred of homeless people. That's only the ones that they have on record, not the ones that are off the grid. And there's a lot off the grid. - They just said there was a news article this week that all the shelter beds are full up. - They are full up. When I got a 30-day timeout from Alpha Project, I had to start the process all over again at HRC to get another shelter bed. Well, every day that I was there, I couldn't take care of my own business. I couldn't go to doctor's appointments. Whatever appointments I had, I couldn't go to because you have to spend from eight till five to see if you got a bed there. - [Mark] What's a 30-day time out? - Due to miscommunication, I was kicked outta Alpha Project for 30 days. - So they remove you, and then you gotta come back. - Exactly. - [Mark] So back and go to the bathroom outside in homelessness, and in 30 days you can come back. It's like a punishment. - Yes, it's a timeout. - [Mark] Yeah, that's kinda crazy. - It is crazy, but I'm grateful that I'm out here and not in there. Alpha Project made me lazy. I got clean and sober in Alpha Project, and they supported me through all that, and I'm grateful for that. When I came out here, I found my NA meetings, I met my boyfriend, I met a plethora of people and contacts. I would never be involved like I am advocating for the homeless right now. It changed my whole life. I found my calling in life, finally. - [Mark] Yeah. So it gave you purpose. - It gave me purpose, yes. - [Mark] And you're fighting for other homeless people? - Yes, I am. The people out here that don't have a voice. - [Mark] And you just spoke in front of city council? - Yes, I did. Twice. - [Mark] Twice? - Twice. - [Mark] Yeah. - Yes, yes. And it was nerve-wracking the second time. There were a lot of people there. (chuckles) - [Mark] Yeah? And what were you advocating for or against? - I was advocating to have 24-hour bathrooms, have 24-hour showers, to put trash dumpsters on the corners down here. I gave them two examples of like the C Street Inn is empty, and it's a huge, huge apartment complex that they could turn into a shelter. The Friendship Hotel in Hillcrest is also empty. There's a plethora of buildings down here. The old post office building could be used for shelters. They have no excuse not to have shelter beds for every homeless person out here. It's not safe camping. That's not the answer. They have safe camp in other places, and they cram 80 tents in a little place. How's that safe when you're right next door to all these other people? I mean, up on each other. That's not safe. It's not comfortable. That's why, I mean we have space between us because we're lucky. But if you look around, everybody's so cramped. - [Mark] Yeah. Have you gotten tickets for being homeless? - Years ago when they first started the encroachment, - [Mark] Right. - and illegal lodging laws, laws, so they say, they offered me a shelter bed. They did not have one available. They took me to jail for seven days. - [Mark] Wait, wait, wait, wait. You got arrested for being homeless because they didn't have a shelter bed. - Yes, I did. - You're the second person that's told me that. - Yes, I did. I spent seven days in jail. My tent got broken into. I lost all my valuable things by other homeless people, not the police. - [Mark] Right. - And I had to start the whole process over again. Re-accumulating my stuff, my clothes, my phones, whatever I had, I had to get back again. - [Mark] Yeah. So seven days for the crime of not having a home. - Yes. And nowhere in the constitution does it state you have to have a house. Nowhere. - [Mark] No, it's just- - We started off in America not having homes. - [Mark] And the amount of taxpayer money that goes to all that, I mean you have the processing, the police, the incarceration 'cause- - It's a waste of money. - [Mark] It is. And 'cause you're still homeless- - When you get out, nothing's been fixed. No problem Has been solved. - [Mark] Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Horrible. - It is horrible. - [Mark] Horrible, horrible. What can you tell me, I mean, the city's trying to pass... I mean homelessness is already pretty much illegal here. - Yes, it is. Unfortunately. - [Mark] And they wanna pass more laws. - Oh, they only wanna pass these laws because it's rewording of the illegal lodging and encroachment laws. And they've been sued, and they've lost a shit ton of fuckin' money due to that. - [Mark] Yeah, so they're trying to change, yeah, they're trying to change laws to get around the- - It's the wording 'cause they don't wanna get sued again. - [Mark] Right. Ah. - Because it, from being here a couple days, everybody's saying it's already illegal. So the- - It's not illegal yet. - [Mark] Okay. - We got it pushed back at city council for six weeks I believe. - [Mark] Okay. - Yeah. - [Mark] So there's still, there's still time to fight it. But like, some of the homeless advocates, and here comes another train, some of the homeless advocates said pretty much because you have the encroachment laws, you have the sit-and-lie laws. - Yes. - [Mark] It's already, they're arresting, I mean you got arrested for- - Yeah. - [Mark] Oh, my gosh. Crazy. - Yes, I did. - [Mark] Crazy. Crazy. - Yes, I did. - [Mark] So what would you want people to know about homelessness and homeless people? You know, the public, the people driving by that see you standing in front of your tent. What would you want them to know about homelessness that they don't know? - I think personally everybody should walk a mile in our shoes. They should experience homelessness. Not 24 hours, not 30 days. Spend three months out here. See what it's really like so you know what time it is, and how hard it really is. We're not lazy by far. We bust our asses to make sure we're okay, and we can make it day-to-day. - [Mark] Homelessness is a lot of work. I mean, how far do you have to go to get your water? - I go up to Walmart, but we also get all the way to Smart Vinyl past Albertson's. - [Mark] Yeah. - Refill water jugs for cheap. 35 cents. But you have to take everything in a cart. - [Mark] Yeah, it's like Africa where you gotta wheel your water jugs there. - Yeah. - [Mark] Fill 'em up and then bring 'em back. - Yeah. - [Mark] That's work every day. - Every day. - [Mark] Do you get a day off? - No. - [Mark] Vacation day? - No. - [Mark] Sick day? - No. - [Mark] You gotta go get your water every- - It's every 24, 7 days a week. - [Mark] Yeah, because without water you die. - That's right. - [Mark] So you- - Without food, you die. You need sustenance, and you need fuel. - [Mark] Right, people don't understand that homelessness isn't lazy. - No, it's not. - [Mark] Homelessness is a super amount of work. - It is. It is. I've never had such a hard job. - [Mark] Yeah. - Ever. And I've worked my whole life. - [Mark] Yeah, we got a... it's been really shocking to me to be here because, you know, it really was a slap in my face, or a wake up call, and I wish it was for everybody, that, you know, we're at this crisis level, and we've gotta get people into housing. - Yes. - [Mark] It's possible to get people into housing, but you have politicians like here in San Diego that would rather criminalize. - Yes, they would. It's all about the almighty dollar. The more people they put in jail, the more money they get. - [Mark] I think you're awesome. - Thank you. So are you. - [Mark] And I will put your Twitter down below for people to follow you. - Thank you. - [Mark] Because I put a picture up of you earlier, and- - It's going crazy! - [Mark] And you started commenting, and I think that's great. So I came back out to say hello. - Thank you. I appreciate you. - [Mark] If you had three wishes, what would they be? - I would wish that homelessness would be solved by letting us help them, and letting us keep our dignity in the process. I would wish that even while we're out here on the streets, people would have passion, and be kind, and caring because we are not trash and disposable. We are homeless humans, as I'd like to call us. - [Mark] Yeah. One more wish. - One more wish. (chuckles) For people to open their eyes, And see it for what it really is. It's a tragedy. It is a tragedy that people live on the sidewalks, and that they are homeless. And we have the means and the needs, but whatever it takes, the simple solutions, the simple solutions to solve this problem. They're really simple. - [Mark] Well... - They just make it hard. - [Mark] Yeah. They make it complicated. You just read my my mind 'cause that's what I was gonna add. And you already went there. So, thank you very much for talking to me. - You're very welcome. It's my pleasure. Anytime. (logo whooshes)"

disability and I had a lot of trouble in school socialization was very challenging for me and so my parents bought me a workout set for the gym and just having that physical outlet for me is what I needed my grades got better I started making more friends in school and it just it radically changed my life after getting saved I was introduced to a man named Rob Moore and so Rob became my mentor and he said God gave me this vision for you and he said in this Vision I saw you working with kids that had disabilities and you were training them didn't know anything about business I knew I wanted to start this company working with special needs and providing Fitness training to them and so in 2016 I knew it was time to start special strong nobody else really in the world does this concept and it grew very fast we didn't have a lot of capital so we were taking out loans thinking we'll pay it off we thought it was a good debt and we didn't understand the curves of business and so we were in a very difficult position in 2018 we had more expenses than we had income we we knew that we needed help around that same time you know we were attending Gateway Church and we saw a commercial for Gateway Business Leaders and right away I knew that this was the answer to what I needed help for [Music] Gateway Business Leaders has been an incredible resource to me to really learn how to manage my business God's way these are biblical principles that last forever the sound strategies that I get from the curriculum and from the mentors that I have in the group really helped me navigate my business during some very difficult times that one-on-one attention that I received saved our business without a question John 10 10 says the enemy comes to steal kill and destroy and high Jesus came that they may have life and that they may have it more abundantly and the Lord spoke to me and he said Daniel that's my heart for this population that you're serving served over a thousand adaptive clients to date we're going to get to help thousands and thousands of additional clients who are in need of our services God is doing big things in special strong and we were excited about what's ahead for us and we were so thankful for the Gateway business leader group how they've helped us and how they're going to help us moving forward hey everyone how are you huh you're not that good huh oh okay all right well I do want to just say something about Gateway Business Leaders this is a vision that God gave me when we actually started the church and uh Steve Doolin who leads this ministry was one of the founding Elders of the church and he was in business and many of you have heard his testimony but he gave 50 percent of his income to the Lord and millions and millions of dollars and then retired at the age of 50. and um was helping businesses around the country and I said I Steve I need you to do it here at Gateway we need to help Business Leaders and so this is a Ministry that we have I was talking to a businessman shortly after we started it and I said hey if you come to the Business Leaders Minister yet he said no I I know that that's uh you know a Ministry I need to support and I said no you don't we didn't start it for you to support it we started it for to support you and so if you're in any type of business which most of you are I don't most of you are not pastors and Vocational ministers so you're in business uh we want you to come and to the Business Leaders get involved but also accelerate on May 18th so we have a conference it's a one day conference what are the times again 9 30 to 3 30 um and uh Henry cloud is speaking David Green Hobby Lobby uh Kelly Shackleford and Steve and I'll be speaking so sign up come if you're in business uh you'll you'll make more money taking that one day off come to that conference and you will work and I can just tell you that because God will help you and teach you that's why we're doing it all right I also want to remind you about voting uh we started uh a while back with some uh Pastors in the area mainly in the South Lake Grapevine Colleyville Keller area and we started just uh saying hey we just want to know if there's someone in the family of churches that's running for school board or city council so there was someone in your family that was you know running for office you'd want to know so we let you know we don't endorse candidates we don't support candidates or political party and we pray for everyone we pray for every candidate we also pray for everyone who's serving on the school board our city council these are extremely important elections and so I just show you uh you can do it take a picture you can see it later some slides if you're in one of these cities here are some people that are running that are a member of the family of churches in this area all right and so I want you to pray for them and pray for everyone that's running but the main thing I want you to do is vote so early voting ends this Tuesday and vote uh you can vote if you can do early voting next Saturday so it's very very important that we vote for city council and for school board members and that we pray for them all right everyone with me on that okay it's important that we determine what our children are going to learn and um that we and that we do that by voting for them um men's Summit was sort of good this year it was incredible it was awesome and so uh guys I would just say to you make sure you sign up early because it sells out every year by the way last weekend I spoke in the four o'clock service at the South Lake Campus and then got on a plane and flew to Georgia and spoke two Sunday morning services for Jensen Franklin and then Sunday night went to the memorial for Dr Charles Stanley and when they heard I was coming they asked me to speak and to share a little bit so you can even see it it's online if you just looked at the moral because I opened the it up right after a song and an introduction by Dr George who's the pastor now of First Baptist Atlanta and so I shared a few comments and then opened in prayer but uh Dr Charles Stanley was a great great man of God and a great Bible teacher he taught the Bible uh so it was a wonderful wonderful wonderful to be there and uh Dr George spoke also Dr David Jeremiah and uh Franklin Graham spoke at it all right so we are in a uh uh a series called simplify and if you think about it uh simplify comes from the word simple now if I asked you to describe your life many of you would not use the word simple as a matter of fact you would use the antonym of the word which is complicated or busy or hectic and that's the way it is uh I though uh am a simple person God allows me to take complicated theological issues to make them simple and you think I do this great job teaching but the reason I do it is because I can't understand it unless I make it simple so I have to make it simple for me you know the number one comment I get I hear when I'm out and I get to meet people is they will say to me our children like to listen to you well it's because we're on the same level so I'm just a a simple guy I I can only do one thing at once my wife knows that if I'm you know doing something I I can just do one thing I literally uh a few months ago when my daughter Elaine was here we were going over her message and she her phone went off she picked it up and and she she was talking she said and then I'm going to go to Matthew and then I'm going to be talking when I'm in Matthew I'll be talking I don't know if they have a a a thumb teaching class to be able to text that fast unbelievable and she's telling me she's Matthew and then she put her phone back down a little while later she said then I'll be over in Luke and on Two And the phone went off and so she did this again I said well what did you just do she said well I had one text that were there wondering how many communion cups to order for this weekend and then I had another text about you know we need to order some more baptismal robes and I tell them how many do that she can do like 107 things at once I can't do that uh uh when I was growing up it was just I could it was just one thing at once I mean that's that's just for me that's just kind of the the way I was I remember trying to juggle and um I I couldn't do it I I finally I did learn how to juggle one ball and so I could just juggle that one ball unless a bird flew by and I got distracted you know I did do something that I thought this is kind of interesting when I think about one that I could only do one thing it works once I learned how to ride a unicycle it has one tire so I I don't know that that's just the way I am okay so so but here we're told in Scripture to simplify our lives and we're told what the Apostle Paul was afraid of his fear and I read it to you out of another version New American Standard last week I'm gonna read a new King James this week second Corinthians 11 3 but I fear I fear this is Paul speaking lest somehow as the serpent deceived Eve and we talked about how did he do it last weekend by his craftiness his sophisticated trickery so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ the Simplicity in last week new America said the Simplicity of devotion so we talked about the enemy of devotion so we're going to talk this week about the secret of Simplicity all right and even in the first point I'm going to give it to you but then we're just going to get simpler and simpler through the message all right so here's number one The Secret of Simplicity is love that's why he said the Simplicity of Devotion to Christ The Secret of Simplicity is love now they're 1189 chapters in the Bible uh 31 103 verses in the Bible and around 800 000 words in the Bible about six hundred and twenty thousand Old Testament about 180 something maybe 189 000 I'd have to go back and count but anyway in the New Testament but about eight hundred thousand words eight hundred thousand words and Jesus boiled the whole Bible down to one word and I'll show it to you all right Matthew 22 but when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees they gathered together and then one of them a lawyer asked them a question that's the last person you won't ask in your question except Jesus he can handle it so testing him and saying teacher which is the great commandment in the law now I know many of you I know the Ten Commandments but there were 613 Commandments in the Lord so there there are the Ten Commandments but there are 613 Commandments Jesus said to him you shall love love he boasts the whole Bible down to one word you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like it you shall you wanna just say that out loud love your neighbor as yourself on these two Commandments that's one of the most amazing verses in the Bible Matthew 22 40 spoken by Jesus the author fetish of our faith the word of God himself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets now it's important to understand that uh the law refers to the first five books of the Old Testament and the prophets refer to the other books the major and minor prophets and then some would say called the Psalms put that in another category and that's fine but that's the way they referred to the Bible the law and the prophets and I don't think we think about this but when Jesus was talking right then and when when the Epistles were being written okay just stay with me on this all right remember I told you that I'm real I'm kind of well known for making simple statements that are smart okay they didn't have the New Testament they were the New Testament so every time Jesus quotes the scriptures he's quoting the Old Testament every time every time Paul quotes the scripture when he says as the scripture says as the scripture says as the scripture says he's grown ill now I believe in the inspiration of the New Testament I believe the whole Bible is inspired I believe that all the new obviously I'm just simply saying that Jesus at that time is saying you can sum up the whole Bible because that's the only Bible they had when he made that statement you can you cannot sum it all up with just these two Commandments love God and love people which that would be one word love love God and love people The Ten Commandments I've told you before divided into two categories the first four have to do with loving God the last six have to do with loving people summed up in those two Commandments love God and love people see Satan's goal is to get us focused on doing rather than being and I would like to remind you that you are not a human doing you're a human being you say so so what does that mean because he said You shall love the Lord God and you shall love your neighbors yourself the reason I'm saying that is is because you can't do that without Christ but you can be that the Fruit of the Spirit is love now love your peace okay long suffering goodness meaning and standard Faith all self-control okay okay but the fruit of the spirit listen it doesn't say the fruit of Robert Robert's just the tree I don't produce love God produces love so when I'm telling you this I'm not telling you something you need to do I'm telling some I'm telling you someone you need to know and his name is Jesus and he is love and we are so busy today we this is what Paul this is what Paul said this just is I'm eating up with this that Paul said I'm afraid of one thing that you get away from the Simplicity of Devotion to Christ and you know who's going to try to get you away from it Satanist he's going to do it the same way he did it with Eve think about it today I mean first of all if you have a job your life's complicated if you're married it's more complicated if you have children you're done I mean you've got soccer and football and dance and and and you know volleyball and and ballet and piano and that's just one week and sometimes just one day and if you get if you have five or six kids I have no clue how you do it everybody's got to go somewhere your job though is not to be a chauffeur even though you think it is at this time your job is just to love God and love others that's it it's just summed up it's just so cool so I said the secret of Simplicity is love but I'm going to keep boiling it down you say okay the secret of Simplicity is love so what's the secret of love so point two is the secret of Love is commitment that's the secret of love if you want to love God you stay committed matter of fact Jesus even said if you love me keep my Commandments you know what he was saying stay committed if you love me be committed so the secret of Love is commitment and yet all the movies that we see focus on falling in love and then you can fall out of love as a matter of fact I I can I can tell you every uh romance comedy Every Love Story the plot is they fall in love they fall out of love then they fall back in love I mean that's what's going to happen so I can sleep during the middle of them because I know what's going to happen but all Hollywood is doing is describing the feelings that you have when you begin to make a commitment to someone that's what Falling in Love Is when you yes someone asks you to uh come to uh a function at church with them okay so we're going to keep this on the up and up we're not gonna go dancing or anything else right now all right we're gonna they asked you to go to a function at church and so you go you make a commitment to go and you spend some time talking to them and they have similar interests similar likes they have good character and so then as you go to another function at church where just everything's going to be a church all these dates okay they're all at church okay and you go so you make another commitment you commit and what happens is the more you commit the more you love you follow me and then when you get married you just make another commitment you fall more in love you need to know by the way um devote we talked last week he said the Simplicity of Devotion to Christ now I can I can figure out uh the meanings of just about any word simply by going to the root word and a lot of people just don't do this I don't know why I don't I think it's like the most simplest thing in the world to do like Simplicity the word would be simple okay but devote what's you know the root of devote is vote that's the root but people don't even know what vote means I'm telling you y'all go vote and we don't know what it means you know what vote means it means vow it comes from a Latin word Vata vadam it's one vatam I think is the way they say it vatam uh it just means Val you see when you vote for a referendum or a candidate you're vowing to support that candidate or that referendum it's a vow so here's what he's saying I'm afraid that the serpent is going to deceive you and you get away from being simply committed to Jesus Christ you made a foul I just want you to keep that now but by the way that's the reason that they put vowels in wedding ceremonies because they discovered a long time ago that the only way you'd ever stay in love is if you kept a commitment and and you probably never even thought about it but the vowels are not that romantic basically you say I promise to say committed to you if you get sick poor and make my life worse in on doors of the house sickness and in health richer poor better or worse I was counseling with a couple one time and I said so let me get this straight you feel like that since you've been married your life has become worse he said yeah I said that's what you signed up for I think this is the reason people say to me now we'd like to write our own vows I was counseling one of the young men in the church when the church was really small about 100 people probably and um his fiancee had broken up with him and so he's heartbroken you know and so uh he and I were talking I I was meeting with him and I said to him hey this is the best thing could have ever happened to you and he said well what do you mean I said well she she doesn't love you because if she loved you she would have stayed committed to you and what's great is that you love her you were committed to her but I said how long have y'all been dating he said about a year I said this is wonderful I said what if you'd been married for 10 or 20. Your Love would have grown because your commitment would have grown and your heart would have been more broken and let me give you better news because many people have gone through something like this but please let me give you really good news the bad news is it takes two people to make a marriage work but the good news is Jesus came to heal the brokenhearted so if you've had your heart broken he can heal your broken heart [Applause] and so I told him I said listen it just means God has someone good for you that's going to be committed to you and so the next week we got together again to meet and he said you know he said God spoke to me just like just like what you said basically he said I was sitting in church and during worship he said I was just worshiping God he said I looked over and I saw this older couple in our church and you know he had his left hand up she had a right hand up and in the middle they were holding hands and he said the Lord said to me that's what I want for you and I've got someone just like that picked out for you that you're going to be able to grow old with and so I thought see that's wonderful and then I thought about it so we were only about like 100 people again remember we only had one older couple in our church and and I we had just started the church I was 38 when I started the church so I'm like 39 years old you know maybe 40 at that time and so I said to him because I knew this old disc couple they were in their 70s they were the only people we hadn't you know in their set over 70 you know so I said hey was it this couple because everybody knew everybody you know well we were like a big life group when we started you know so I said so was it this couple that you saw when you said you saw an older couple he said oh not that old I mean someone your age so I uh uh kicked him out of the church but anyway it's [Applause] no you know what's funny is now he's in his 40s you so you're old so there's this love story in the Bible and let me just it's between uh a man named Boaz and a woman named Ruth books named Ruth okay so it's it's easy to remember but Boaz falls in love with her like we say he fell in love but you know why because he tells her why she asked him why are you even taking notice of me let me show you the answer Ruth 2 verse 10. so she fell on her face bowed down to the ground and said to him why have I found favor in your eyes that you should take notice of me since I'm a foreigner and Boaz answered and said to her it has been fully reported to me all that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband okay here's what he said he was saying you're a woman of commitment and that's the kind of person I want to be married to I want to be married to someone that I can commit my life to and that will commit her life to me and I have heard it's been fully reported to me that you made a commitment to your mother-in-law as a matter of fact did you know that her commitment to her mother-in-law this is she she marries you know this man and then he dies and so Naomi then says to her just go back to your own country now and she says no and she says this wherever you go I'll go your people will be my people your God will be my God and then this what she says till death do us part and that got in the wedding vows she was basically saying I'm committed you Boaz is looking for a wife and he says you know what I want I want someone committed I want someone who's committed so you know I got saved nine months after Debbie and I got married but I started trying to get my life right with God when I was 16. and um so I I the guy that uh helped me started getting my life right with God was actually James Robinson's best man in his wedding and he's the one that introduced Debbie me to James and Betty before we even got married but he saw this gift in me so he was helping trying to get me to you know get right with God and he said you you need to um uh he was taught he was mentoring and he said you need to start you need to um he was I remember him thinking how do I say this he said you need to date um some better girls and I thought the girls I'm dating are pretty good you know so I I because I was lost yeah maybe I was lost okay okay I was lost and he said no no no I mean you need data good girl you need dated girl you want to be married to you know you need to you need to and so I remember looking around the church and there there were there were good girls and Debbie was one of them and she was the most beautiful one there obviously of all the good girls and so I I asked her out for a date and uh 15 20 years after we'd been married I remember asking edra because I didn't have reputations being a good boy you know and I said to edger her mom I said why why in the world did you let your daughter ever go out with me and this is what she said see my mother's mother grew up I mean she lived in our home when I was growing up we took her in and my she said this is why because during choir practice when your mother and I were in choir your father would bring your mother's mother his mother-in-law in and set her down and hold her hand and make sure she was seated and take care of her and then he would go do his things he did all sorts of things in the church you know helping run the sound and being a deacon and all these other things and then he would come and get her afterwards and take her and he said she said I watched your father and I thought there's got to be something way down deep that's good in here [Applause] but here's what she did she actually saw how my father treated his mother-in-law and I think she thought maybe he'll treat me good when okay so anyway hopefully I am treating you okay all right so so the secret of Simplicity is Love The Secret Of Love is commitment so what's the secret of commitment here's Point number three The Secret of commitment is choice now this is extremely important and I'm going to get a little theological in you one of the number one theological questions that pastors are asked is why did God even put the knowledge of the tree of Good and Evil in the garden as if God had done something wrong and as if God was setting them up for failure kind of judging God and it's exactly opposite again same reason I talked last week why he drove them out once they ate from it because they were in a fallen State he didn't want him to live forever in that Fallen state so why did he even put two trees in the midst of the garden the tree of life and the tree of death in essence why did he do that here's why because you can't have love if you don't have choice robots can't love God didn't want robots he could have created you without a will and without a choice but he wanted you to know love if you didn't have a choice you wouldn't know love you would know what it's like to be loved or to be loved or to love someone else you wouldn't know you would never know you have to have choice to have love this this you have to under you have to get this so what we're talking about here is to be simplify your life and I'm getting it down just very simply for you here's how you simplify your life you just choose to love God and when you choose to love him then you're going to commit to him and when you commit to him then your life's going to be simplified it's that simple it's that simple again I talked about uh Debbie and we got married I was 18 when we got married and so um it was after my freshman year of college I graduated high school in 17 and we dated our junior senior of high school and then freshman year of college and then we got married so I was 18 years old and um but and not shortly not long after we got uh married then we moved to Dallas and uh I started meeting people we started meeting people our age of course 19 20 21 22 that they weren't married yet and we started meeting some more successful people and all of a sudden this insecurity came out in me because we were meeting these men who were smarter than I more talented more gifted better looking richer better jobs and I remember thinking I know Debbie chose me you know we grew up in a smaller town I know she chose me then but there were only three choices and the other two didn't have jobs but now she's meeting better looking nicer Kinder I wasn't kind I was still growing in my relationship with the Lord I didn't have kindness I didn't have the fruits of the spirit and and it wasn't successful and I just I just thought I just she's meeting these men she's going to figure out that she's got other choices and it it scared me to death and we we were talking one time because I was so I was so jealous if she talked if she just you know if another man was just safe they were just having a conversation across the room at a get-together or something I'm just I'm saying what was he talking to you about you know I was just and she just had to say to me you have to understand I love you I love you now here's why she loved me because she chose to make a commitment to me you follow me and I still didn't understand it then I've had to grow in that and to to finally figure out I know I know she loves me because she's made thousands of choices over the years to stay committed you have to you have to catch this for first John 2 15 says do not love the world or the things in the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him okay why would he say don't love the world if love isn't a choice see this thing about I just I just fell in love with it yeah let me ask you this anyone here anyone ever made an impulse purchase okay yeah all of you and this is what we say I just I just fell in love with it no you didn't you made a commitment to it and now you owe Visa more money than you can pay because you made a commitment and you wish you could go back on your commitment and you might even wear it and keep the tag on it so you can take it back I'm I just want to help you you say I want to simplify my life okay just choose to love God and love other people it's it's that simple now you may have to take some weights off your board I talked about stress one time you may have to do something I understand there are other things you may need to see a counselor you may need to work through some emotional health issues that you have some mental health issues that you might have you have to work through some things with your childhood but if you make a choice to love God you'll simplify your life I'm going to tell you another one more story about uh Debbie when we um uh you know I've been around where we didn't have cell phones you know we didn't have cell phones growing up and then cell phones came out and only people had them were people that could Mount them in their car they were mounted in the car and then they came out with the I won't say have any of you remember this bag phones did anyone here have a bagged phone a look yeah I had one too careback made me feel so important to most of my phone my phone yeah that cares here if they weighed about 40 pounds and then they came out with the walkie-talkie motorolas remember those huge and then they came out with the Star Trek beam me up Scotty phone just flip it open look how cool I am I got a flip phone and so by then you know I saw I got Debbie this phone okay well she was running the women's minister at the church and and you know and then she would go to lunch with you know some ladies or our team or whatever but I got offended because she wouldn't answer her phone now she didn't she didn't like to keep it on rain because then she'd be in a meeting you know and um and then or she'd be at lunch with her women's team or something you know and so she put on vibrate here's the difference that I had to figure out but it took me a while to figure it out man we we carry our phones in our pocket right vibrates we feel it women carry their phones in their purse so they don't know so she she again we're in our early 40s okay I'm still working through all these insecurities so I'd call she wouldn't answer and I just got more and more insecure more and more rejected angrier and I just think well you know if you don't care enough to answer your phone I don't care enough to leave a voicemail and if you don't care enough to answer your phone when not call I don't care enough to answer my phone when you call him I just started getting offended very offended she just she doesn't she doesn't love me she didn't answer the phone and so we finally talked about she said I just don't hear it but when she realized that it was important to me she would take her phone out and set it on the table in the women's team meeting and she would say and I just want you to know something if if Robert calls me I'm answering this phone and I'm not answering it because I'm the women's Pastor because he's the senior pastor I'm answering it because he's the love of my life he's much more important to me than all of you and I just met with a pastor this last week flew in from California just so he could meet with me for a couple of hours and I do the same thing this day and my team can do the same thing I put the phone right there and I say to them I say to my team and I said to this pastor is once you know if Debbie calls I'm answering this phone and can I tell you why it's because we're committed we're she is more important than any meeting that I'm going to be in and here's the wonderful thing even get married at 18 and me not even knowing Christ then and all the silliness that I've told you that I've gone through the insecurities and the inferiorities this week this week is our 43rd wedding anniversary love is not that hard it's just

      "corpus": "Hello friends Bears aren't only one of the most popular representatives of the animal world but also one of the most iconic ones just think of the famous teddy bear in reality however Bears aren't always as good-natured as they are portrayed in cartoons they can actually be very dangerous currently bears are the largest land Predators on our planet having appeared on Earth about 6 million years ago they immediately became the personification of power and strength in today's episode you'll see some amazing and frightening incidents with bears that got caught on camera the cyclist set up his camera in the forest to film a couple of Tricks he was performing on his mountain bike the cyclist set up his camera in the forest to film a couple of Tricks he was performing on his mountain bike he made the jump and seemed to be doing fine as he left the shot however as soon as he came back and as you can see he wasn't alone there was a bear chasing after him the animal appeared as if out of nowhere the man started screaming and tried to fight the bear off with the bike luckily the animal ran away despite the fact that bears are predators they can choose to ignore humans even if they're close by but that's not always the case I definitely wouldn't want to trade places with the hunter from this video the man came across a terrifying black bear it's a big and strong bear the kind that can't be fought against with bows and arrows which is all that the man had on him apparently the bear sensed the enemy's weakness and decided to attack him knocking him to the ground it seemed that those would be the last seconds of the hunter's life but miraculously everything worked out the bear ran away and the man escaped with just a fright and this Hunter was a bit better prepared for the encounter he had a double-barreled shotgun in his hands and he almost had to use it the bear was running for the man and getting very close but then it turned into the bushes it then made a second attempt to attack the man and then a third one but every time it ran for the bushes instead the hunter was carefully backing away never taking his eyes off of the bear fortunately everyone survived this encounter the bear never attacked the hunter so the man didn't have to use his gun when animals live in the wild and need to survive and protect their offspring their aggression is understandable but when trained bears attack people it's way more unexpected this tamed bear named Rocky lived with people for five years and never showed any signs of aggression it isn't surprising that the trainers felt calm around the bear [Music] when suddenly Rocky seemed to have gone mad he attacked the trainer Stephen and bit him on the neck the other trainers immediately started driving the Predator away but it didn't let go of Stephen for a few more seconds [Music] they did eventually manage to get the enraged bear off of Stephen [Music] and the trainer even managed to get up on his own unfortunately he got seriously injured and didn't survive the author of this video came across a bear in the forest the animal clearly didn't want to let the man go in peace the bear pursued him for several minutes it climbed trees then climbed down rushed at the man then stopped but at some point the Predator came too close so the man had to use the special repellent spray which had an instant effect the bear immediately ran away some of you may be wondering how that bear managed to climb the trees it turns out that it's actually one of the Bear's most important skills that few people know about although bears are large they are great at climbing trees thus hiding from them in a tree isn't a good idea [Music] the man from the next video didn't know that he climbed the tree but the animal climbed after him the man tried to fight back but he wasn't really successful meanwhile the bear kept climbing higher and higher fortunately the poor fellow eventually managed to drive the animal away it climbed down and ran elsewhere and this bear got even closer to the man it climbed the tree to get the hunter who set up some kind of an observation deck in the tree it was a rather scary situation it seemed that the animal could get the hunter but apparently the bear was simply curious having assessed a situation it climbed back down Bears aren't only capable of climbing trees but also mountains a climate from Japan had the most terrifying experience of his life when he was confronted by an angry bear while climbing a mountain [Music] the Predator suddenly jumped down on him from above so the climber tried to defend himself screaming and fighting back with his fists but that didn't help much it seemed that soon either the bear would get to the climber or the man himself would fall off the cliff fortunately neither of these things happened and the bear ran away a little later [Music] polar bears also aren't some cute and fluffy animals they are very dangerous polar bears live mostly where there are either no people at all or very few of them but encounters with them still happen once in a while and here's one of them the polar bear made its way into the village and ended up between the houses the woman went out into the yard unaware of the Bear's presence the animal hit the woman with its paw it seemed that no one could help the woman but someone did decide to try and threw a bottle at the bear surprisingly it helped the polar bear got scared and ran away the woman was incredibly lucky because all she got were some minor injuries one can come across a polar bear in many places in the north for example in Alaska however encounters with local grizzly bears are still more common and that's what happened to the authors of this video the grizzly bear was at a distance of only a few meters from the people they were treated into the thickets and the bear walked past them at a distance of only a couple meters it was only by some kind of miracle that the bear didn't notice them but even having simply run by them the bear gave those people an adrenaline rush that they won't be able to forget for a long time by the way grizzly bears are one of the largest and most ferocious North American Predators the other incredibly large bears are Kodiak bears and polar bears [Music] one of the subspecies of brown bear is the Kodiak bear it's the largest predator on the planet this Bears height at the withers can reach one and a half meters while its length is about four meters the weight of the giant bear is also impressive the female weighs a quarter of a ton and an adult male weighs almost 450 kilograms those are the average numbers while there are individuals that weigh up to one ton [Music] the largest bear in history is believed to have been the short-faced bear that once lived in South America it's known as Ultra dust according to scientists this bear lived from about 2 million years ago to 500 000 years ago [Music] the weight of the giant Predator reached two tons while its height was at least three and a half meters the bear fed on lions woolly rhinos wolves Tigers giant elk and deer it had tremendous bite force a skeleton of the short-faced deer was found in Argentina in 1935. according to the National Geographic statement there's currently no animal in the world that even remotely resembles such a powerful predator [Music] there are some other record holders among Bears a miniature but formidable Predator the sun bear is the smallest bear in the world it's also the rarest bear on the planet it's a species of the family of urisa day and is the smallest representative of this family [Music] this animal doesn't grow higher than one and a half meters while its weight varies from 25 kilograms to 65 kilograms in Asia for example the sun bear isn't even considered to be dangerous moreover this bear is sometimes tamed and kept as a pet [Music] and that's all for today

your everyday life thanks so much for joining us [Music] I think one of the big mistakes that people make and this relates to what you're saying is we always equate pain as being bad yeah and it's not right you know many times it's an act of love now God doesn't make people mean so they'll hurt us right but he will use them yeah to make you better so that's why as stupid as it sounds I can say now I'm not really sorry that I was sexually abused by my dad yeah because it's made me who I am yeah and so I realize now I mean I prayed for my dad to die I prayed for my mother to leave him I mean I prayed for God to get me out of that situation and of course I had to come to the point of saying well why didn't you yeah yeah you know why you could have yes you know why do you like somebody that mean live that long and hurt that many people yeah you know well God didn't get me out of it but actually he did something greater he brought me through it yeah yeah and a strong person that could do what I've done all these years and I think what I've realized even with my own kids we I had a hard time letting my kids suffer right because I went through so much and so I'm very guilty of having delivered them from things that I should have backed off and let them go through wow and we think love is to always deliver people from anything that hurts but it really right it's not yeah I mean I heard I was listening to a preacher this morning and he said if you love me and you see me sliding in the wrong direction and you don't get in my face and confront me then you do not love me wow yeah well you know we have to we have to be willing sometimes to let people go through things or they'll never get free we just keep enabling them to do the same thing over and over and over so all the thing is I think an answer to your question God why do you let's have why do you let this happen all pain is not bad yeah I mean some of the pain that you went through even in situations that I'm aware of that I went through similar situations and you know we think God why are why after what I went through as a kid why are you letting this happen to me now but like you said before we're trying to get something from those people that God Only God can give us and so I remember a situation in this to me this explains that a woman that used to come to my meetings somebody told me that she was really hurt because I never spoke to her and I went to God and I said I would I don't want to hurt her yeah why I don't even remember seeing her and God said I didn't I hid her from you because I didn't want her to get from you what she needed to come to me wow and so how many times is God yes you know we want somebody do this for me be nice to me tell me what to do show me what to do and God's saying nope they're going to have to go through this matter for me so we're going a little deep here I don't know how many people are losing us or staying with us but oh no it's such good stuff you've got to go deep to fix this you know you have to go deep to pull those roots of rejection out and like Chris said you have to know I mean that you know that you know that God is good yeah and that he loves you and I trust him and he's not going to let anything happen to me that is going to ultimately be to my detriment I'm I may hurt and go through some things but if he's allowing that it's for the purpose of getting to something in my life that I am totally blind to right that he wants to get in there and heal and make well yeah yeah I remember feeling so rejected by God during my the beginning stages of what I was going through and I was like God how could you allow that to happen and he just he really went through a whole scenario like didn't you allow your daughter to do something that you really didn't agree with but you you allowed her to do something and I was like I did he's like I have free will for him and I can't go against that for him as well he's like and so then I saw this vision of God like almost pulling my ex-husband's shirt when he was going like I got this like visual of him like pulling his shirt like to not go certain places and he was like I wanted him to stop and that just blessed me and then immediately following that I started I listened to a sermon about when the disciples were in the boat and it was rocking and they were going through the storm and they were upset with Jesus because they were like you're in a on a pillow I don't know where he got the pillow from but he was a pillow it's a boat pillow pillow and he was knocked out during the storm and they the thing that got me that I I just it just resonated with me they were just like do you care about us like they actually asked him like do you even care and so I just remember that feeling of rejection that I had with God because I I was I was like man God we beefing right now like my friends would ask me and I'm like we're going through it but then he loved me his kindness and he loved me so much through it that that that that tension that that that moment of me being honest with him has just drawn me so much closer to him and because I needed that isolation and that's why 2020 was actually kind of good for me um and at the time I even I resigned from my Ministry job I just I just stepped away for a minute just because I needed to not do all the time I didn't need to like lead people into worship honey I need Worship in my own bathroom and cry you know and just connect with God and so 2020 was good it was bad in a lot of ways but it was good for me because it isolated me spiritually too so that I and reconnect with God and not rely on community groups small groups this group that group not saying that those are bad because I love them but I'm saying I didn't Thrive off of running things through them I had to go connect it's really important I want to make sure that our viewing audience doesn't miss you said that God wouldn't go against his free will your husband's free will even though what he was doing was wrong and bad and you were praying for it to change and something that has really helped me is to learn that anytime we're praying for somebody else yeah to do or not to do something we have to remember that God's not going to go against their free will to answer our prayer yeah wow yep yeah that's what he said yeah and so you know just because I pray for this person to change and they don't change or I pray for them to do something and they don't do it that doesn't mean that God's not God it doesn't mean he wants me to keep going through that yeah but it just means he's not going to make that person make me feel good yeah right you know that's why that's why you got to know how to and you know I I mean I I know that I know that I know Jay even though what you went through was pure hell you will be a much better person when you come out on the other side of this and you're you're just about there but you're going to be stronger you'll be better you'll be more sensitive to other people's pain you know you're going to know things about God you didn't know before and God doesn't do bad things but he does work all things out far good yeah if we love him and trust him yeah so good I I think there are so many people right now who are going to have a complete change in their life a revelation through something that was said through what Joyce just said to Jay whatever it may be but I really believe some of those roots are coming out today want to hear more from Joyce on this topic we've got you

      "corpus": "Hearing in the spirit is not a skill to be acquired it's a sense to be sharpened you already have the sense you are already hearing God the holy spirit is already speaking to you right here right now he's saying something to you there are the voices of self Satan secular and spirit secular is the voices of culture people family members anyone who speaks just according to the thinking of the world Satan obviously we know questions the word and contradicts the word constantly we know that sometimes self can speak to us things that are random you can have a thought that's just kind of a neutral thought and that's understandable we all have those uh and then there's the spirit this is the speaking of Truth and so the key is not in getting the Holy Spirit to speak to you the key is in silencing the satanic the secular and self and you do that all that's left is the spirit and you hear him loud and clear so how do we do this number one the word please hear me now insisting upon adherence to the word insisting upon biblical accuracy is not religious and I think we have to get that out of our heads this idea that oh you know you're you're you're going to the word that's head knowledge that's that's philosophy that's that's just the wisdom of man no my friend the word was inspired by God second Timothy 3 16 and 17 all scripture is inspired by God and is useful to what teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives it corrects us when we are wrong and you felt that correction before I'm sure and teaches us to do what is right God uses it to prepare and equip his people to do every good work so we understand the Bible the word of God is inspired by the Holy Spirit every word this is why be very careful of anyone who questions foundational teachings of the word be careful of yourself even watch out for your own reasoning when you have to bend things in scripture to fit your opinion well I don't know let me let me let me just kind of shift that meaning there just a tad not not completely or you know what let me let me question that word there let me let me just kind of shift the definition of that word so it seems a little more consistent you do that you're going to end up in confusion and torment to the mind so the word must be the foundation get it out of your head that the word is religious get it out of your head that the word contradicts the Holy Spirit you want real power you want to walk in the presence of the holy spirit in such a way that your life will Mark the Nations then get in the word the word is the foundation of our understanding of the voice of the holy spirit that is the safety net you want a word from God I got a secret for you you want a word from God open your Bible if you're serious about hearing the voice of the Holy Spirit you'll get serious about reading the word don't tell me you want to hear the Holy Spirit and you're not even opening your Bible don't tell me you want a word from God and you won't open your Bible you want to be spoon fed maybe by others just speak specifically to my situation so that I don't have to go dig into the word defying the truth that applies to my specific situation you just give it to me in bite-sized pieces no my friend we must dive into the word we must receive the word we must have a rich knowledge of the word and that knowledge is set on fire by the Holy Ghost Revelation is knowledge set on fire by the holy ghost look at the scripture read of all the different people that God used they had sharp intellectual Minds that the Holy Ghost set on fire they had they had an ability to reason according to the scriptures and the Holy Spirit gave them boldness and authority and Clarity and peace because of that adherence to the word of God itself so if you're serious about hearing God you got to get serious about the word now as I said the word is the foundation I'm going to give you four Keys here the word is the foundation to knowing the voice of the Holy Spirit why because the holy spirit will never contradict the word that written word is there for your guidance and so you have this Foundation now here's the word and that serves as my grounding that serves as my my stability well Jesus said you build your house upon the sand that's like building on your own understanding or without his words you build your house upon the rock that's like building on his word so that when the storms come by the way he did not say if the storms come he said when the storms come you'll be standing why because you built on a solid foundation the word and so we build our lives upon the words of Christ that's not a contradiction to the spirit the spirit works with the word it's not religious to study the word it's not really and anyone who thinks that is going to get stuck in immature Christianity you're gonna be you're gonna be a baby Christian all your life and I'm not saying this to be condescending I'm saying this because we need to wake up I'm not saying this to tear you down I'm saying this to wake you up I want to help you grow past certain things and if you're intimidated by the word that's okay so was I if you're if you're nervous about well maybe maybe I won't get anything really out of it and it kind of intimidates me I don't really understand all that just start reading it I was at a place in my life where I didn't know anything about the scripture and I had to really dig in and discipline and and and and and make use of what God had put before me and that begins with simple obedience so the word now watch this serves as a foundation and then number two is wisdom please hear what I'm about to say but before you do I want you to write in the comments section if you'll commit to the word just type it in the comment section just put the word exclamation point so the word becomes the foundation now and then what begins to happen when you read the word when I begin to know the word suddenly there's this root of wisdom that begins to take hold in my life I read the word my mind's being washed my mind's being renewed I'm beginning to think like God thinks I'm beginning to understand his nature and begin to understand his ways now watch this once I know the word now then wisdom begins to naturally follow now wisdom is how the Holy Spirit speaks to your spirit so the word that's just the Holy Spirit speaking directly to you through the word but wisdom is the holy spirit speaking to your spirit Romans chapter 12 verse 2 says do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that by testing you may discern what is the will of God this is so powerful what is good and acceptable and perfect well how do I discern the will of God how do I discern what he's saying I do so by renewing my mind how do I renew the mind my friend it's the word as you read his word the mind is being renewed James 1 5 if you need Wisdom ask our generous God and he will give it to you he will not rebuke you for asking him so the word becomes the foundation and as you become a person of the word wisdom naturally results why because that word is getting into your spirit and when the word gets into your spirit suddenly you begin to think like God thinks suddenly you begin to reason like God reasons suddenly you begin to think and reason and believe and behave according to the holy spirit's guidance because your mind is being renewed by the word so the word is that foundation and now wisdom acts as the structure okay so you have you have the foundation of the word and then wisdom becomes the beginning stages of that structure and that structure goes into place based on the word so wisdom is the holy spirit speaking directly to your spirit it is this this pure overflow of the directions of God it is a purposeful pool on your life you just kind of have this natural inclination in understanding what God wants you to do in any given situation why because you become familiar with his nature when you know the word of God you understand his will and as you begin to become more familiar with his will now you begin to become more familiar with his ways the word shows you his will and that begins to develop wisdom in you wisdom shows you his ways first the word foundation then the structure wisdom then there's the whisper and this is the holy spirit speaking to your mind the natural mind now some have said well you know if it's written in the word then the Holy Spirit doesn't need to say it because it's already in the word and if it's not written in the word then the Holy Spirit wouldn't speak it because it's not written in the word but this fails to take into account this type of reasoning this thinking fails to take into account that often we need instructions for the very specific details of Our Lives not always are you going to find chapter and verse chapter and verse what you should do specifically in every situation of course you have the word to understand the general will of God then you have wisdom which helps to teach you his ways but then what do you do after that when you need an ultra-specific instruction from the Lord in order to make sure that you're on the right path that's when the whisper comes in but don't try please hear me now do not try to hear the whisper if you are not a person of the word and that's going to make some of you mad it's not my goal to make you mad I love you and I want to just tell you the truth John 14 26 but the helper the Holy Spirit whom the father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring to remembrance all that I have said to you so the Holy Spirit reminds and he reveals he reminds you of what has been said but he also reveals what God is saying let me say that again he reminds you of what has been said but he also reveals what God is saying now some might ask does this mean that what he speaks is on the same level of authority in terms of the scripture no because he's speaking very specifically for very specific situations and instances in your lives in your life and therefore that wouldn't be something that could apply to everybody all the time these instructions don't have Universal application and for all time when it's the whisper as I'm describing it here so he whispers to your heart but don't try to live your life by the whisper and this is what some Christians do thinking they're spiritual they think they're spiritual because they kind of say oh you know I just kind of like the wind I go I call them hippie Christians they just I however the Holy Spirit takes me I'm like the wind and and there's no discipline there's no Foundation there's no grounding everything's based off of their experience their encounters they're never interpreting their encounters to the word they're only interpreting the word through their encounters well this is what it means to me this is what I feel it's speaking and that's all I'm telling it it just means it's a lack of maturity in the faith period and so we need to come to the place where the word is first and then the wisdom and then the whisper if you're a person of the word and you're walking in the holy spirit's wisdom those are your safety nets for when he begins to speak with the whisper and many Believers have this reversed and then number four so first it's the word then it's wisdom then number three the whisper and then number four wonders now this is where you'll see prophecy Visions dreams Miracles guys we believe in this these have not ceased the gifts have not ceased prophecy is for today the spiritual gifts are for today Miracles are for today Deliverance is for today healing is for today dreams are for today Visions are for today Supernatural encounters are for today we can't dismiss this why because the word tells us so and so the problem arises though when you try to live your life by the Wonders instead of by the word many Believers have this reversed so the word is the foundation wisdom is that structure The Whisper of the holy spirit is like the drywall and some of the materials that get added onto that and the Wonders that's like the nice decorations for your house the furniture the the extra pieces if you will but if you live your life only with the extra pieces just the Wonders my goodness you're never going to have a solid foundation some believers they just live by their experience and then the word is an afterthought that's going to cause you to end up with all kinds of confusion strange doctrines confusion tension bondage um isolation it leads to all sorts of problems anxiety that's why you start with the word then the word produces wisdom wisdom causes you to be mature enough to be able to distinguish between the whisper and your own thoughts and then the whisper helps you to understand and navigate the world of Wonders so the word is first don't try to live your life by wonders and the whisper start with the word build it as your foundation then you'll have the wisdom then you'll hear The Whispers And then you can have the discernment that's necessary to receive only what our Godly wonders father I pray in the name of Jesus that you would begin to cause your people to desire your word Lord we repent of any neglect of your word help us to recommit to being people of scripture Holy Spirit we surrender to the way that you desire to speak help us to not box you in to just what our experiences tell us but help us Lord I pray to go to higher places by living according to your word and father I pray also for healing Deliverance a fresh Touch of your power come on let's believe for God to touch you right now the anointing of the holy spirit is

stadiums in size that just gets thrown into landfills drastically damaging the environment so on one side we have so much waste and on the other we have to people globally that just need a simple t-shirt which boils down to many factors and exactly why I put our team and all our resources into getting as many unused and overproduced clothes as possible away from ending up in landfills and rather into the hands of people around the world that need it the most so we reached out to our friends at champion who quickly jumped on board with a massive donation as well as Bridgewater and in total they donated more than 2.7 million dollars worth of clothing we are now headed to the Hopi reservation in northern Arizona that dates all the way back to the 12th century where they have built their traditional Sandstone villages on top of these massive Rocky Cliffs and are in desperate need of our help to stay warm during their cold winter months on arrival Darren met with Wendy who is at the Forefront of enhancing the lives of her fellow tribe members and has been struggling to do so for so many years there are over 10 000 members of the Hopi tribe the term Hopi refers to Peaceful people taught to be caretakers of the land these people don't have very much that they're some of the most generous people you'll ever meet the ability to just have immediate access to things it's not there for us the Hopi tribe is situated hundreds of miles away from the closest Quality clothing and food stores which is bad because the winters here get freezing cold and they need all the help they can get to stay warm and put food on the table people are salvaging what they have as far as heating resources they can't freely burn the wood that they've bought because of the cost of it when we first got here I realized how big the task ahead of us was the quantity of clothing that was being delivered as a cow are we ever going to get through this people had driven from all over the state hours and hours away to come and help us prepare for this distribution I was first at the understanding that we were going to get some clothing we'll get a palette or two and when I was told the amount I was like wow that's going to be huge because they have to travel so far people don't even have cars then I started realizing how much this meant to these people foreign [Music] [Music] just seeing everybody's excitement like wow this is not only new clothes but this is a really really nice clothes it was amazing our kids our people are just so happy it means a lot to us to not only want to give to us but to also want to learn about who we are I'm a big believer of signs my eyes are probably all red rain in the summer snow in the winter is what we want so when we finished you know sharing with peaceful entropy and the snow fell right when it was done I took that as these people were supposed to be here and they're good people I'm always going to be thankful for that thank you Mr bees maybe some of the youth will realize there are people out there who think about them I think a lot of times they feel like they've been forgotten we were so moved by the Hopi people that we wanted to help them even more and when speaking to their Community we found out that they also struggled with food insecurity so we brought in 13 tons of fresh and non-perishable foods which will help reduce their food shortage problem and provide them with 25 000 nutritious meals you can make an ongoing significant impact in the lives of the Hopi people by clicking the Donate button down below and 100 of proceeds from the Donate button will go to the Hopi Relief Fund after visiting Arizona we decided to send the team to Detroit and to India to distribute even more clothing but before we get there I want to thank the sponsor of this video electric e-bikes whose mission is to change people's lives by increasing their Mobility while being energy efficient which is slightly contradictory to this plane but electric e-bikes doesn't yet make planes so for now I'm on one of their e-bikes which is really affordable and easy to use they have really stepped up to the plate this year and helped us do so much good like rebuilding an orphanage giving away 20 000 pairs of shoes and even traveling to three different cities to give clothes out to as many people as possible so click the link in the description below and please purchase one of their e-bikes so they can continue supporting us and helping us do more great projects like this in the future now let's go to India a massive shout out to these organizations on your screen they helped us out in India as well as the Metro Detroit youth group for helping us distribute the rest of the clothing to tens of thousands of people in need if you made it this far in the video let me know in the comment section below by saying I'm not a bad person I watch this video to help you make more money so you can help more people goodbye

be sleeping in all of them like the cheapest capsule Hotel a first class cops a hotel the most futuristic capsule hotel and so much more starting with the library capsule hotel and working our way up before we begin the challenge here are the rules if you leave before checkout time then you're eliminated from The Challenge but if he can survive the night you get to experience Tokyo's top attractions the next day until we check into our next capsule hotel we actually have to be quiet once we go inside because it is a library the first capsule Hotel we're staying at is called the book and bad Cafe it's a library style capsule hotel where you sleep inside a hidden Fort it looks like we're in a treehouse we're literally sleeping inside a bookshelf for 50 a night you can choose from thousands of books or magazines to read Sean what are you reading um looking at some girl this is the coziest thing I've ever been in but imagine a gaming setup here the only thing I don't like about this place is that you can't be loud and I love being loud at night on top of having unlimited books to read they also serve you unlimited drinks and snacks and only one color thank you Alex it's okay let's go to sleep I'm gonna have to share a bed with Sean tonight because I forgot my password and they won't let me get another capsule Sean what's that so it's just my phone oh okay well we survived the first capsule hotel but it's only gonna get harder and harder from here and if we can survive the full 100 hours then we get a check into a surprise 100 000 mystery Resort oh my God I should have known so one of the most interesting things about Japan is you can actually rent a boyfriend or girlfriend for a day and ever since Sean got here he's been swiping non-stop on dating apps with no luck and right now we're gonna give Sean the best surprise ever yeah that's it that's it yeah so Sean I know you haven't had any luck since you've gotten here so we brought the luck to you you can open your eyes yes all right you guys ready to have some fun yeah yeah let's go yeah to break the ice our boyfriend for today took us on the ferris wheel to sing some karaoke after the ferris wheel he took us inside a photo booth to take some cute pictures [Music] came out okay I think they're exchanging numbers to meet up after them when we got done with our pictures he took us on a walk outside the mall so we could all get to know each other and after that he took us all to a fancy Japanese restaurant to have some dinner so far I would say 10 for 10 boyfriends since he even offered to pay for dinner and finally after a day of fun we had to say our goodbyes Sean got a boyfriend for a day but we got a new best friend he was actually so sweet like the best boyfriend you could ever ask for no seriously y'all better surprise me with a girlfriend next time so like this video before we go to our capsule hotel for tonight we stopped by the most futuristic Cafe stabbed completely by robots that's so cool this robot is literally taking us to our table who wants to sit here while you wait for your food the robot will Entertain You by singing playing YouTube videos and even dancing oh our food's literally coming right now oh wow that looks good thank you it said Thank you while we were eating we learned that some of the robots here were controlled by real people from home this gives disabled people a chance to go to work by using webcams to see and talk to customers can you wave at me please oh my gosh I'm gonna cry give it above you have robot balls they don't have robot balls bye thank you dude it did a heart is it a heart so we're on our way to the cheapest capsule hotel for tonight and meanwhile cat it's at the worst review capsule Hotel you're telling me he's staying here dude he's holding a knife I'm scared so our hotel is only twenty dollars and let's find out why it's so cheap what would you rate this place out of ten two two the toilets were a bit stinky I did see a bit of mold the lights didn't work on the first night as well you're a subscriber right yeah thank God or we would have had to kick them out so the reason why it's the cheapest capsule hotel is because it doesn't come with any free food or amenities like the other capsules people were literally sleeping in the hallways because of the mold but honestly it's not that bad there's a TV and you can stay right in the middle of Tokyo for only twenty dollars a night so there's not a lot to do around here we're gonna get some sleep because we have a lot planned for tomorrow so we officially survived day two and the goal for today is to visit Disneyland Tokyo but before that we're gonna check out some convenience stores Japan is literally famous for their 7-Elevens they have so many cute things we didn't even know existed this is so cute they also have sushi rice balls fruitcakes and even a smoothing machine that makes you fresh smoothies this is the freshest smoothie I've ever had [Music] so we're actually at Disneyland now and we're about to find out how different land Tokyo is for the rest of the world oh my God Disneyland more than America are ready the first thing that was different was the food we got some very cute snacks dude this is cold like ice cream there's chocolate inside it's a 10 out of 10. really good then we went on a few rides and noticed that the lines were way shorter and that was the longest ride I've ever been on and because the lines were so short we were able to go on every single ride in the park okay and after going on all the rides we ended up getting even more food I feel like I'm at school trying to find somewhere to sit whoa so juicy this is the best pizza I've ever had so they have four different kinds of popcorn here and we're all gonna try them out yo that's very interesting mine tastes like cotton candy oh my god look how cute this stuff is I so I will say that Tokyo Disneyland is a lot cleaner way more aesthetic way less crowded and a lot cheaper now we're going to show you guys our Capstone hotel for tonight the sleep lab wow I feel like I'm inside a space pod inside your space pod is a dimmable light and a camera that actually records you while you sleep so not only does it record you but it also takes pictures of you to observe how well you slept turns out I only slept good 30 of the night just like how only 30 of you guys watching are subscribed subscribe so I can sleep better why'd you steal my underwear bro those are my dirty underwear why are you still in my dirty underwear got some more dirty underwear for you Sean [Music] and the goal for today check out all of them first we visited a hedgehog Cafe I've never seen an albino hedgehog before they even had Flying Squirrels in there this thing doesn't look real quick then we went to a snow owl Cafe he's judging me after that we dine with some cats at a cat cafe play with some puppies at a Dog Cafe fed some sea otters and finally hung out with some monkeys at a monkey temple after the animal cafes we visited a very strange Hotel staffed by robots [Music] they speak four languages and their eyes they don't follow you wherever you go can I get your number are you free tonight before we check into our capsules for tonight we visited Tokyo's biggest arcade I think we'll have one for Alex let me try to win one it's time to eat now oh yeah I only won because it was shaped like gumbo after spending all of her money at the arcade it was time for us to spend the night at our next capsule Hotel the first class cabin this place separates guys and girls on different floors so we had to say our goodbyes to cats but for 67 we basically got a small hotel room with a nice touchscreen TV on top of that the bathrooms were very clean and came with a giant Spa I'm starting to see why this is a first class cabin so we just ordered room service and we told him we wanted McDonald's and they actually went out and got us a McDonald's how cool is that McDonald's in Japan has a completely different menu this is their famous teriyaki burger and I actually have a shrimp burger right here the best part is you have 24 7 room service and if we open up the curtain right now we have a butler waiting for us out there I wonder how cat's doing this is actually really really roomy it's like perfect and if you get bored you can pull this down and watch TV [Music] after surviving 100 hours in capsule hotels it was finally time for the surprise but since it was our last day in Tokyo I wanted to enjoy a few more things first we went to a muscle Girl cafe where girls with muscles slap you then we stopped by Nintendo World and finally we went to an all-you-can-eat wagyu beef Buffet this is the best meat I've ever had probably better than to meet Sean had from the Runa boyfriend and to get to our mystery Resort we actually had to travel by train and fun fact phones in Japan actually make a sound whenever you take a picture to prevent guys from doing stuff like this [Music] and now the moment you've all been waiting for the surprise luxury resort this luxury resort comes with a zen garden a heated Infinity Pond yeah [Applause] and there's a total of five Japanese style bedrooms downstairs look at this dude look at the view I love this view each bathroom actually comes with its own hot tub that is the coolest bathtub I've ever seen wait till you see upstairs it's literally just a normal bedroom in case you guys don't want to sleep on the floor we have another Master room in here and the best part is actually outside these are our bikes wait that's actually cool and here's the joke a shower after you work out and a sauna oh my God oh my God after 100 hours of being in capsule hotels we're gonna relax and catch up on some sleep and you guys should catch up on some of our videos [Music] [Applause]"

no it's perfect all of this is perfect Danny I love it and I love you I love you too and so I was I was thinking about the wedding maybe what if we wait a couple years just I really want to give you that wedding you deserve and and yeah they are pretty expensive babe we don't have to wait I have ten thousand dollars already set aside for this wait you do yeah I've been thinking about and planning my wedding ever since I was a little girl I have the Pinterest board and everything with the Mariachi and the pink flowers all our friends and family oh my gosh excited just thinking about it I can't wait to my family's home I'm excited to tell them guess what Daniel he is everything okay [Music] since it's progressed to stage two we should start treatment immediately does that mean I'm gonna lose my hair um yes unfortunately that is one of the side effects of chemotherapy so how much is the treatment going to cost well Insurance should cover most of it but I did speak with accounting and there is a fifteen thousand dollar deductible fifteen thousand dollars surely there's a payment plan right um not for deductibles and Hospital policy is we need that all up front before we begin any treatment I'll give you some time to talk [Music] I have money that I was saving for my wedding that we can use there's no way I'm letting you use that why not you're my sister I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get you better Carmen's right Isabella and talking about your wedding for as long as we could remember [Music] no man oh my God hey everything is gonna be okay promise I don't want to die don't say that you're not going to die but I you're gonna be my made-up honor just like we talked about since we were little [Music] sisters forever right [Music] sisters forever [Music] oh definitely pink right bed Isabella sorry it's been hard to focus um what are we talking about the flowers I was telling them how you you want the pink over the white well which one is cheaper uh they're both about the same the white flowers might cost you around 300 less okay well then let's do the white we had I thought you you said you want to cut the cost as much as possible that way if we have anything left over we can put it towards my sister's treatment okay well let's talk mariachi bands now the Prices range starting from about 1500 they go up from there depending on how we can cut that too hey are you sure but money your dad's waiting in the car we're gonna take Carmen to the hospital she's not doing well oh no I can go with you guys no no no Mom and Dad will be there it's it's okay stay here it's important Carmen is Right finish what you're doing and call us when you're done love you guys sorry your sister's not feeling well do you want to talk head count I know that Daniel mentioned you wanted a big wedding then he's usually charged per head so depending on how big we can keep it small close family only hey you're getting rid of everything you said you've always wanted [Music] I know how important this is to you it's not as important as her Carmen's condition is getting worse if we don't start treatment right away the chances of recovering aren't so great how are we supposed to start treatment if we don't have enough money for the deductible it is you have to have payment plans or something it's like this is foreign [Music] is there any way that we can put down a few thousand dollars now and get started please that's what we have she's our daughter we just want to see her get better oh fit were up to me I would but unfortunately it's out of my hands what happens if I don't get my treatment do you really want to know it's not easy to say but what usually happens is wait I have the cash right here thirteen thousand dollars now before you even try to say anything I could not even think about the wedding with what carving is going through so I talked to Daniel and we decided to cancel the wedding what [Music] what I know I know how much the wedding means to you it's nowhere near as important as what you mean to me if I can't have my healthy sister by my side as my maid of honor I'm not doing it but no butts the wedding can wait you can't so this is not up for debate foreign [Music] I love you too [Music] dinner's almost ready oh you're blunt today I like it how did everything go well I actually have two things to tell you yeah what is it tell her tell her I'm gonna go use the ladies gotta tell her first the doctor got my test results in my cancer is officially intermission hey what that is the best news but wait there's something else well anything else that is all I needed to hear no the second thing is really good too because look this is for me no this is more than I gave him and besides I'm not taking money from you mom or dad it's not from us well not technically you see this past year has been really hard but I never felt alone not even once because you were always there for me you found ways to make me smile when I was sad and took care of me [Music] you were there every step of the way not just financially but you also helped to give me courage when I was scared still can't believe you shaved your head so I wouldn't have to do it alone I don't know how I would have made it through if it wasn't for you sister you always knew what to say but the one thing you didn't know was that I was recording my entire journey through treatment after everything you did for me giving up your wedding to pay for my treatment I wanted to do something for you so I made a GoFundMe and uploaded the videos I told everyone what she did [Music] so you see your story went viral people from all over the world donated and now you can have the wedding you always dreamed of I never canceled my wedding or gave you the money because I wanted anything in return I just wanted to see you get healthy that is the only thing that matters to me I know and I am now so please take it [Music] okay but only in one condition [Music] how do I look Mom you look absolutely beautiful are you ready yeah but where's my maid of hey sorry I'm a little late the floor has misplaced the bouquets here you go you look so pretty Izzy are you kidding me look at you you look beautiful and I love the hair hey is everything okay yeah but is everything going to change now that you're moving out come on Carmen of course not just forever right sisters

talking about how I was in a wheelchair rolling away yeah I don't know if that's uh correct with standard times 2023 joke I don't know what do you want to be who can okay I'm done guys welcome to day three Los Angeles it started rough man our biggest guest of this whole trip which is hard to believe because we had robbed your dick yesterday which top guy to me just Top Notch that episode in itself is Just Gonna Change Your Life literally should I sit here go for it oh I can handle it oh okay you sit down it's fine you don't weigh that much so we were guest lists today because something came up big last minute we came here we set up and we started texting so huge shout out to the one that saved us today and he's about to roll up right now brother this is the only reason we have a show tonight I love you bro it really pulled through man like I texted him this morning I'm gonna be honest with you like same day calls for me are usually not not like the most fossil thing bro but I mean you're one of the best people in the world bro I love your positivity and you're a goat bro you're a YouTube Gold OT shut up hey Brett good to see you man you know I was just having a normal Wednesday it's Wednesday Wednesday I think so and I got a call from the boss said yo I need you so I told everybody I gotta go I'm pretty sure I use the words like need please help SOS may day may day I need to say that actually yeah I would have probably sprung off like yo I'm in town I want to do a show with you but the fact that you added those keywords in I was like he's desperate he's desperate for a clout dude oh man this is something else dude Welcome to The Amateur hour bro this is crazy and it's a fun show people don't know this because unfortunately it's surpassed by my laziness but I'm really into like weird like if a puppet show just randomly started when we were mid topic my respect for this program and podcasting as a format would go up tremendously well you are going to be disappointed but I do want it to be on record that like that's the kind of stuff that I'm into like Eric entrees that type of stuff hey guys can we get puppets ordered for the next episode I'm just too lazy that's why oh that's why I'll say it all about this the man of the hour nobody knows this but today we did not have a podcast in fact we're here in La this is our last day here and we had a big opportunity that fell through dude when you told me that you were like man can I say uh all right I I I'll say it just bleed it's a big guess just believe it you were like we were supposed to have yeah and then you said but like he had a family emergency so now we're having you I was like dude if your audience knows who you were supposed to have and now you have me they're gonna be so let down yeah maybe leave the audio in yeah smile more keep going keep crushing it I love you guys yeah thanks for having me on thanks for watching guys you're beautiful you're one of a kind smile more dude I started getting hot brother yeah bro thanks dude yeah that's fun we'll see about the Russia stuff I mean if we like it we can keep it dude that was fun dude your story is uh it reminds me a lot of Stevo when I got to talk with Stevo it was like it's like I'm looking at somebody that probably wouldn't have been here it's funny too because we both have the voice like the raspy voice I think that's what happens when you like survive yeah it's like maybe crack two has something to do guys what's up with my podcast see it's gonna be awesome we had Steve on the when we had civil on the show he like drew a picture of himself and then stapled it to his chest with a stapler dude he's a real Looney Tune dude yeah he's on oh that's amazing yeah we all love him yeah you know what else I love them these Ruffles this specific it's too late this specific flavor is potentially the goat of potato chips I'm a sucker for salt and vinegar really dude a whole bag do you like the salt and vinegar too you do yeah but I ordered those these are so I haven't had good you want there's like one no no I haven't had like a good song yeah Doritos that's like my weakness back in my gaming days where I just binge didn't care about my health I would eat a bag of Lay's salt and vinegar the whole bag you would make your tongue literally raw my tongue would bleed I ate so many salt and vinegar chips that's dedication dude that's easy though I feel like that's only like three chips with those hey thanks thanks man appreciate you appreciate you dude it's fun it's fun talking to you guys yeah you guys are awesome yeah and we're in like at least me and you are like a similar age bracket yeah actually I didn't know we were so close yeah that's awesome so that's why it's fun to talk to you yeah I'm used to talking to a bunch of youngsters yeah me too bro me too let me know if you ever need me all right around you know where to find me I'll be here in the successful well we lucked out we got four podcasts done in three days and we shot two podcasts for other people so six total podcasts in three days I feel very successful on this trip I feel like we are leaving with a bunch of fantastic podcasts like I'm very excited it's hard to even pick which one I want to upload first because they're all so good you guys tell me in the comments you've seen them all at this point put in the comments who you think should be uploaded first tell me the order maybe just maybe we'll go with that we're gonna pack it up gonna find some dinner I know we haven't vlogged much today I feel like not much at all yeah so it's maybe a short one but uh thank you guys for watching absolutely really really appreciate it we'll come back we plan to you ain't getting rid of them I just want friends in my space you can come home with us and we'll just bring you back later all right sounds good hi hi beep beep beep you record them I am a beautiful morning about 8 A.M palm tree the sun is shine and it's warm and this guy just cussing at the world bro he's literally just yelling at nothing yelling cussing swearing really feels like L.A right now going back to Ohio mission complete hope you guys enjoyed some really just repetitive free days in a row of Vlogs love you have you ever consider doing anything mobile especially production or podcast this is about what it looks like and it's a thousand dollars each trip so this is two thousand dollars to get back home with all our gear which I mean I've always said you gotta pay to play with whatever you do you have to pay to play so that's what we're doing going back home I'm pumped to see my kids and well how long we've been here four days yep four days it feels like a month I've never got along with LA too much I like coming here and getting home good whatever makes that is a bad design right there oh okay okay we gotta go go I don't know how we just made it I know it don't look like nothing but this place is a wrap guys we're back home we made it to Columbus Ohio amazing trip successful we're gonna go home hang with the kids and call it a day thanks for watching our trip to La podcasts are coming soon March 15th is episode one and uh we love it beautiful you're one of a kind smile more"

volcano if it worked you'll get an egg it's gonna work all right Gabe we're ready dump that bucket as fast as possible here we go oh it's in um I swear my calculations were it's coming it's just slow just give it a second let me come look at this thing it only came up that far by the end of this video I will get an A that experiment was a complete fail but we still have six other experiments to prove that we're worthy of making an a see it's about to erupt I see that look at that lava what do you think still enough okay yo it's busting over here Professor Dan this is one of the strongest magnets in the world that I could buy legally and today I'm going to teach you guys what it means when Opposites Attract okay let's see what you got I mean honestly this has to work it's just a magnet how can this fail Professor Dan how do you like your eggs scrambled that's what I like to hear here we go what the heck you put the magnet on back I told you I didn't know which way bro we're gonna get a freaking f okay now it's right side up all right go that one Watson that was excellent egg over here bro all right boys that is some scrambled eggs it worked oh gosh this is the difficult part this is the magnet separator oh gosh and that is how you separate two magnets that attract a force of over 1300 pounds what grade do you think you deserve I got something that will make you say we get an A what are we doing this time catch up dude that went like 50 feet up in the air get up how about we go for a uh solid B no I'll accept it like you made him sad so Professor Dan we have built a boat out of balloons Let's Talk About Numbers density volume displace gravity buoyancy I know you like that stuff it's on the periodic table it's not on the periodic no no one 12-inch balloon can hold only 0.35 ounces James weighs 190 pounds which means it would take approximately 87 balloons to make James float I'm eager to see what you got before we show you guys this experiment we have built a boat this boat has less than 87 balloons I'm going to prove to you that this will sink and that will float oh hold up don't hold me hold on just hold it wait hold the boat shut up that's kind of a gray area isn't it he's kind of floating he is kind of floating yeah but he's half floating that's true because that is half the amount of balloons that is required to make James float so now I'm going to show you how James can float this is over 100 balloons if this actually works I'm gonna cry Moment of Truth boy he's you gotta commit you gotta commit get in there it's a better float than last time technically you are floating so you get a B solid B you know what I'll take a b Professor Dan today I'm going to teach you that I know Force equals mass times acceleration we got this this is going to prove that force allows us to have this giant balloon move this go-kart that we built in my garage all right you ready we're ready three two one did you cut it it's cut come on I don't feel 84 three two one go guys it's not going anywhere no it will work watch I'ma let go of it now it's shrinking oh it was a valiant effort but unfortunately it's enough I have something that will fix this hold this watch us all right full speed full speed guys it's not working oh we failed we failed there's no way you get an F on that one it didn't go anywhere F is for friends who do things together Professor Dan with the science between architecture and physics we have built something truly indestructible the Lego tower it stands at over 30 feet tall and I can guarantee you that nothing will knock this over nothing nothing I can give it a shot give it a shot nothing nothing good luck let's all try to push it together okay three two one push push see I told you let's try some wind [Music] you cleaned it off yeah you cleaned the sand off that's about it I told you guys nothing will knock this over this is my number one fan you have enough of those you can have a fan club it's on high oh it's not doing anything again what did I say nothing nothing what if I told you that this Lego tower could withstand 250 mile per hour winds I'd like to see that fire up we gotta move out the way [Music] that airboat is pushing Winds of over 250 miles per hour oh it's still standing oh gosh oh gosh there's parts that still remain standing so how about if we give you a c I'll take a c I respect the C Professor Dan yes this is aluminum we took the weakest metal and made it the strongest metal this took us over one day to make we're gonna prove to you that this ball is so solid that we won't be able to cut through it with anything it's not really working oh it's not working Gabe why don't you heat up one of these knives to over a thousand degrees you got it okay here we go here we go I'm trying dude it's not going through it at all it just wow what if we tried a saw saws are pretty sharp here we go does uh that mean I get an F it does come on you said nothing I did I said no you did you did nothing all right we're going in with first ingredient this is our hydrogen peroxide this is part of the periodic table you're sure about that this is soap this is yeast so this is our activator you want help and he's got it oh gosh shake it shake it shake it yo can I bottle flip it oh it's almost hard it's hard Shield game Shield why am I on the shield yo y'all want to play Hot Potato all right I'm down wait no PSIs starting to impress me a little bit here I've been a heart attack I got a bigger bottle we'll see the bigger bottle oh yeah no no way you already know are you sure you don't need any more safety equipment than that wait don't point it this way yeah point it towards the cameras I mean oh it's getting plump bro [Applause] baby you get an A plus [Applause] maybe you've come a long way since science class this is extra credit we're going for the double A plus oh dude you're putting that oh my God I'm gonna put the whole bottle oh you got it all right take cover I don't think we shook it enough oh baby yeah that has to be worth the extra credit I give you an A plus extra credit for that and extra points for safety safety"

like this is really important and I've been procrastinating this for like two weeks procrastinated [Music] see procrastination is dangerous [Music] procrastination poisons productivity right now if I didn't procrastinate I could have this job this video done by the end of the day I'm gonna I'm gonna go get lunch see I I think I spend 50 of my time procrastinating fifty percent of my time not working and then the other 50 of my time frantically working to make up for the time that I spent not working what's for lunch he said he wants chicken got chicken [Music] it's great intentions to sabotage by compulsive inaction thank you [Music] how do you deal with procrastination I embraced it I go with it what does that mean s wait until I can't wait anymore and then go really fast I don't know if that advice of waiting until the last minute to do things I don't know if that's good advice and I think about I think about the times when I made like feature films like a movie that's taken three or four years of my life for these huge projects and how much I've struggled with them because I lose focus I lose interest they stop they stop being interesting to me but then like when I had my daily Vlog I had a deadline every single day there was no opportunity within those years there's no opportunity for me to procrastinate and it worked do you see do you see my facial hair see much longer my beard is now than it was in the previous shots that's because I it's been a week that procrastinated this from a week this is a movie about procrastination that I've I've been procrastinating for a week [Music] hey dude just this and this please foreign [Music] this this is how I would describe the entirety of my professional life it's either a state of boredom wherein I want to do more or a state of burnout where I need to do less it's never ever in this healthy place in the middle it's it's one extreme or the other these two states these are destructive to the creative process and it's procrastination that enables these two states so I'll procrastinate which leads to boredom to fix that I need to I need to do more which leads me to kind of burn out I need to remedy that by doing less so I start to procrastinate then I get bored I need to fix that so I frantically do more and I get stuck in this Vicious Circle [Music] this crazy space alien technology from insta360 is the um is the sponsor of this video and I use this thing for a lot of shots uh in this movie see how it's following me it's doing that by itself so I can move over here and I can even go behind the tree and it still follows me very impressive very impressive stuff [Music] so it's called the insta360 flow and at its core it is a a three axis gimbal for for your phone but I've had it for a few weeks now and it's become something it's become something more for me it's like having a cameraman that's smart and does exactly as it's told all by itself see 99 of my videos I just shoot by myself and I'm always looking for technology or cameras or toys that help me be more efficient as like an independent filmmaker as somebody who doesn't need a camera doesn't have a cameraman and that's exactly what this does all right watch this see ya see how it's not recording watch this so just uh get back raise by hand flashes this light at me now it's recorded now I walk around and it follows me wherever I go even I kind of walk behind stuff or if I come over here and I hide for if I get totally close up and then when I'm done it's kind of raise my hand and uh look at stop stop recording it's kind of amazing it's a little tiny one-person camera crew you know a question I get so often by up-and-coming creators and and people that are new to YouTube is what kind of camera should I use and my feedback is always it's not the camera it's how you use it in a tool like this makes a camera your phone or whatever's in your pocket it makes it a hundred times better this plus the phone that you already have is like this is a tiny little 159 dollar camera crew so nice work insta 360. this is now yet another piece of my like filmmaking gear that permanently lives in my backpack and makes my movies better insta360 flow is what it's called it's 159 bucks there's a link below foreign [Music] I don't see procrastination as something that holds me back but it's something I can harness to push me forward see I know I don't have the kind of focus that it takes to like architect a huge project and dedicate three or four years of my life to realizing but I'm capable of something called hyper Focus wherein if there's a project I can realize now I could dedicate everything to it and and tackle it with the kind of efficiency of a Japanese bullet train they call it attention deficit disorder and this is dead wrong it's attention deficit Advantage this is my superpower no I can't focus on my health and exercise 20 minutes a day three days a week but I've run 25 marathons I ran 70 miles last week no I don't have the focus to spend like three years on a single movie but I can make a movie today and then I can make a movie tomorrow I can do that 800 days in a row and call it a daily Vlog that's that's part of that that's that's the superpower so rather than trying to bend my gut brain to accommodate the world around me I just work to bend the world around me to benefit my fantastic brain and as far as oh as far as procrastination this is just this is a small tax a small burden a small hurdle I have to jump over in exchange for this superpower [Music] a lot of the um themes ideas and even like direct quotes in this video around ADHD and add a lot of those were taken from an author named Jesse J Anderson he writes about uh he writes about those things and he doesn't have very like relatable humorous way so if any of this kind of stuck with you or felt familiar to you or any of these ideas uh discussed in the video you should definitely check him out he's got a newsletter he's on Twitter right here um brilliant guy and and thank you Jesse for Lending me your ideas for this video [Music]"

      "corpus": "The Joe Rogan Experience now in application of this thing one of the things that we're seeing right now um when we're talking about Quantum Computing back to that um one of the things we're seeing now is chat GPT chat gbt which is this fascinating uh AI program that essentially scours the entire internet for answers for things and is so good at it the answers for things for just just data people are getting diagnosed with certain diseases based on symptoms and blood work and it's super accurate uh legal papers it could fill out legal forms and it's it's wild the capacity you can pass a bar exam that way too yeah the bar exam can be passed with a chat bot yeah it's like 98 right now here's the question if quantum Computing gets involved in AI what are we looking at well first of all AI is a software program we're talking about homogenizing different kinds of essays on the web splicing them together and then passing it off as your latest creation basically plagiarism using digital computers it's a software question however quantum computers is bigger than that quantum computers is a hardware question where it actually increases your ability to do much more than with an ordinary digital computer so the two of them the chat Bots that are revolution in software and then quantum computers which are revolution in Hardware when they get together watch out so we're talking about an extremely powerful alliance between software and Hardware now also as you know chatbots will also lie cheats Swindle Joe Oak and do all sorts of crazy things if you're a high school kid you could write all sorts of Science Fiction scenarios and some chat bot May grab pieces of that nonsense and incorporate it into their essay oh interesting so it can't discern what's what's accurate exactly the whole point this is the whole bottle of wax chatbots do not know what is correct or incorrect they just gather information so they could be gamed that's right all they do is homogenize cut up existing things that sound human put it together and then people say my God that sounds like a human rodent of course a human did write it it's not interesting that they could game that also if they wanted to find out what percentage of people believed a certain thing if they had some bad actor some foreign you know governments that decided they were going to spread narratives as widely as possible and chat gbt just gathers up all this information it could give you an incorrect under understanding of what's happening in the world and give an incorrect understanding of politics of the economic point is that even though there's a good aspect to all these software programs the downside is that you can fabricate truth because they cannot tell the difference between false and what is false and what is true that's very interesting if you talk to the chat uh the chatbot and say do you know the difference between correct and Incorrect and they say no it's just on the web they're just instructed to Cobble together existing paragraphs splicing together and polish it up and then spit it out but is it correct it doesn't care it doesn't know so it is essentially like an amazing resource of information that's it's that's very flawed that can't discern and can't think I do this I have this problem all the time I'm a professor and I give assignments to the students sometimes write a term paper so what do they do some of them plagiarize oh how do you catch them well you read the s say and then you read another essay and you say I've heard that before right right the old-fashioned way yeah but you see that's what a chatbot is a chatbot is like a teenager that plagiarizes other people's essays passes it off as their own now I'm a scientist we like to think about things that are creative new Innovative things that will change our perception of the world none of that absolutely none of that comes from a chatbot a chatbot simply rearranges pre-existing essays that's all it does the the thing is though that's all it does now that's what's interesting what's interesting is what you're talking about with Quantum Computing and the insane computational power right and then apply that to having access to all of the information right but there's a good aspect too you know when I write a book um my publisher has a fact Checker a fact Checker that goes through all the different statements that I make to make sure that they're all correct there is no fact checker for chat Bots let me repeat that again there is no fact checker for chat Bots that is the whole bottle of wax that's the reason why they're so dangerous because they can they don't know these chatbots are machines they don't know what is correct what is incorrect it's all the same to them that's the danger that they could incorporate teenagers ranting and raving about all sorts of garbage and put that in with articles that sound reasonable easy that's the problem now here's where quantum computers coming in quantum computers can act as a fact Checker you can ask a quantum computer to remove all the garbage remove all the nonsense in these articles and it'll do that so in other words the hardware may be a check on some of the while statements made by software but the problem with that is who's the Arbiter of the information like who decides what what's real and what's not how does the chat bot decide is a chat bot ideologically biased the chatbot doesn't the chatbot is simply the quantity does yeah Quantum Computing and then it's going to be able to discern what's real and what's not real if they're gradations of what is true like it is partially true or whatever it could give you the the detailed understanding of what it what could be misconstrued what is partially correct what is misleading but partially correct you said I'm saying right now the chatbot just splices it together like an editor that's all it is and an editor not a fact Checker and spits out Cobble together articles that sound reasonable but that could be Dynamite inside some of these articles that were spliced into what was proposed with a quantum computer you can fact check things and then you can say this is 90 correct this is totally wrong this is sometimes correct and you you get gradations of what is correct and incorrect well if you can get it objectively accurate fact Checker that would be a huge step up from what we have today because a lot of people have very little faith in certain fact Checkers and when you find out that they're ideologically biased or they're governmentally biased and if you could have something that could just tell you if you've been paying attention to how Twitter is doing it now where they have Community notes have you seen this no I haven't it's interesting like say if someone makes a statement about something controversial climate change whatever and then this controversial statement gets refuted in the community notes and then people will start commenting and really intelligent very well-read people on specific subjects will chime in with peer-reviewed papers and all these different statistics and that show and then Twitter will correct it and it will say readers have said and then and then put up the relevant information right see that's what uh chatbots do not do today yeah they have no understanding of correct or incorrect false and true no understanding of that but with Hardware coming into the picture that's more advanced then yeah you're talking about machines that can do that automatically but it's the problem who controls that machine like say if China gets a hold of one of those machines first if they develop a quantum computer first and they start implementing it well we have to make sure that our quantum computers can check other people's quantum computers to make sure that they're not fudging the facts right now remember that if this is not done legally if there are no laws passed in this direction and it's in fact the wild west then of course the politicians get involved and it becomes a real mess now we do know that you cannot yell fire in a crowded theater therefore there are limits to free speech and we get that but how do you make limits on statements that are written on the web that no human can possibly follow right that's where quantum computers can come in quantum computers can are powerful enough to survey the entire landscape and give reasonable rebuttals to things that are just outrageous well more than that it's going to be able to instantaneously change how we interact with each other in terms of language barriers all these issues that we have currently I'm sure you you're aware of Google had their earbuds there was a feature where if say if you went to Spain you didn't speak Spanish you could talk to it and they would talk to it and it would translate back and forth so you could have a real-time conversation I'm not sure how good is it how good is that Jim but if there's something like augmented reality and we have something like that you're going to be able to instantaneously translate what people are saying yeah there'll be no language barriers for people no we'll be able to I think that would change just human perception across the world just the way we view each other it's so easy to think of each other as being different because we speak a different language and we live in a different part of the planet but that would literally change how we interact with each other yeah and just remember that where do correct ideas come from correct ideas come from interaction with incorrect ideas it's the it's the struggle between ideas out of which correct ideas emerge and this does not happen on the internet because of course with chat Bots everything is cobbled together cut splice and simply glued together with Scotch tape masquerading as an essay so with fact tracking I think it's going to be different Because unless we do fact checking the politicians will get involved yes and this is going to be a real mess so I would hope that the industry does fact checking by itself rather than having politicians do it it's such an important point that you said where you said that the bad ideas have to exist so the good idea is triumph and that that's really an argument against censorship on the internet which is another problem that people have especially censorship when it comes to something being ideologically based but when you're you're thinking about Quantum Computing I think I think this is small potatoes right I think we're looking at literally being able to change how we interact with the universe like when we're talking on our last podcast about the preponderance of evidence that there's things that operate inside of our atmosphere that are Beyond imagination that are they they operate with no visible means of propulsion they move at insane speeds we don't understand what they are if we think about what Quantum Computing is going to be capable of that's the kind of stuff we're thinking about right yeah you see quantum computers are the ultimate computers because they're competing on atoms if there are aliens in outer space and I think there are it means that they they also have perfected quantum computers and they can do calculations that are far beyond anything that we can calculate with like for example a wormhole a wormhole in principle is a gateway between two distant points of space and time which allows you to break the Einstein barrier and go faster than the speed of light but the calculations are horrendous it may take a quantum computer to sort through what happens when you go through a wormhole and wind up on the other side of the universe and the aliens probably already have done that they've probably had centuries of experience with quantum computers because that's the ultimate computer you can't compute in anything smaller than an atom and they probably already have used the quantum computers to navigate through wormholes let's say hypothetically it's so fascinating when you think of where we were just a few thousand years ago or a few hundred years ago to where we are now and then you imagine the invention of quantum Computing you imagine everything just the whole idea of whatever we think of current computer progression just goes out the window and it's insane calculation capabilities like we could be able to do something like that in the future right quantum computers allows us to calculate things that are way beyond our ability to calculate today like going through a wormhole or warp drive or even the question of multiple universes uh people ask the question how come quantum computers are so powerful it's because they compute in in parallel universes this is the Multiverse which of course Marvel Comics has discovered and the Oscars have discovered recently but the Multiverse idea comes from quantum physics electrons can be two places at the same time now some people have a hard time getting their head around that but get used to it that's why we have lasers that's why we have transistors that's why we have the internet that's why we have this conversation because the electrons that are in this microphone dance between universes at the at the atomic level and so we have to get used to the idea that quantum computers introduces a whole new way of looking at reality now reality is not a Marvel comic but the idea of the Multiverse comes from quantum physics and that is electrons can be multiple places at the same time"

I'll see you tomorrow it's your birthday and your your wife called this morning and asked if I'd surprise you with a cake um but we got really busy and we worked through lunch I didn't have time to go out but there's a really nice Bakery just down there so either you come with me and I'll buy you a cake or please just explain to your wife that I tried because frankly I find her quite scary she's very intimidating that's cool happy birthday thank you I was 36 when we met I was working in my family's Bank in Frankfurt we got married had two girls and bought a house knife was good then the economy collapsed the bank failed and uh Hitler came to power and one day I took Aegis and the girls to play tennis and there was a sign on the court that says no juice allowed I have to look at my family and say we can't play silly it's tennis I don't even really like tennis but for me it was it was when I knew Germany wasn't my home anymore I'm sorry but what were we talking about um I I asked you when your family were moving here it's a very long-winded way of saying next week of course they're scared to come even though it's much worse there every day another rate another anti-jewish regulation Mr Frank I really didn't want to leave Vienna um my my my mother had no husband and she was born I was malnourished I was I was only 10. and um she found a Dutch family who are willing to adopt me and then the day came that I was supposed to leave and I hid under the bed so that I missed the train and she was begging me begging saying that my new family had food and medicine and Holland would save my life and she tried to climb under the bed to drag me out that she couldn't reach me and she said later actually that she'd almost given up if she had a I probably would have would have died I was so unwell sometimes I think here's this woman who made this huge sacrifice so I could live and it doesn't seem to me that you've forgotten her I think you pay her back by living a life worthy of her sacrifice I'll try okay do you know how she eventually got me out from under the bed she she told me that my new family had a cat so once I was on the train she ran home and wrote to them and she suggested that they get one and they did hello I'm looking for Mrs Vandenberg I just want to add about some kittens oh well do you know when she'll be back uh she's my landlady I don't keep track of her coming and goings um if I did I'd probably tell her not to give you a kitten excuse me have I done something to offend you you catty corner oh yeah you're the man who reads books in bars Yankees right yes oh God that was a really bad form of me I'm really sorry I was only waiting there for 30 minutes twiggling my thumbs you never showed up at least you had a book buddy have a nice day you know what your problem is you don't have a sense of humor because what I just said was really funny and the reason I ditched you is because you were being pompous and you were lecturing me like I was stupid and I was actually going through a really rough patch and I was tired of being underestimated but again I was nervous I was going for a rough time too and this girl appeared off ered Me by Kelly Brandy I thought she was I thought she was one of the most beautiful girls I'd ever seen didn't think he was stupid thought you're out of my league well they can't walk away in a half now not really so I got married at 18 to my high school sweetheart and after a few years well I realized we actually didn't have anything to talk about [Music] and I was working at a textile Factory and the money was good the job was Soul destroying I used to work next to this bloke and it's always going on about how much he hated his life and wanted to leave this place and go traveling and move to America and one day I snapped I said go on then leave and he did he left and I thought it'd be over the moon I was actually jealous I thought if I'm so happy in my own life why would I be jealous of this guy one of those moments you know realize you need to change something and the longer you leave it the harder it is so that day I left my job I went home and I asked my wife for a divorce wow yeah you were the bug the bug in the book you woke up one day and you turned into a bug yeah I was the bug yes that was when I became a social worker so did you get a divorce yes well sort of how do you sort of get a divorce we agreed to split and I started doing the paperwork but then her mother got sick so she suddenly had to leave town I haven't done it yet huh we're going to look like you don't believe me but we really are is that what you think this look is oh is it not no what is it then I was just wondering if you kissed someone would it be considered an infidelity I don't know technically legally probably [Music] let me just break the law would you like to go somewhere where we can break it some more Australia if I turn my back on you you'll disappear but I really don't

her Point him thank you Mrs fan Paltz we were neutral in the Great War and the queen just issued a statement saying we remain neutral also that's it that's your argument a press release by a figurehead you really are naive me it's been nice to me what's not nice about telling me she's being naive to think that Hitler cares about her Queen's Proclamation she's your queen now to her man and if she were here tell her what I'm telling you Hitler's objective is France and to get around the Maginot Line he needs to go through the Netherlands so neutral or not if France declares four on Germany he is coming well then we'll fight with what cheers the Dutch aren't equipped football the Dutch look out for each other it's not Germany and this country saved my life no your adoptive parents saved your life for countries made up of people Meep and people even the the good loving wooden shoe wearing people of your beloved Holland will be no match for Hitler when not if he comes and attacks so Hermann my love my vague grumpy cynical control what do you propose we do oh I have no answers or the answers I have aren't the ones you want to hear a lot of things we should move to America and what do you think well I think America sounds far away and I'm hoping that Meep is right that he'll leave the Netherlands alone I finally learned the language it's much difficulty dear Adolf Hitler please stay away from Amsterdam because our dear Edith can't possibly learn to say may I have some champagne in any other languages nobody's eating my cheese puffs except for the nice quiet Dutch what do you think here do you think Italy will invade the Netherlands I think I think these are delicious Mrs Frank be a true Dutchman he knows how to stay out of a fight it's a good

      "corpus": "I'm Mark Vince and I'm about to take a Sting from the most aggressive band on the planet this Nest here in front of me is home to the Australian bulldog ant that can both bite and sting and I'm about to find out just how much damage you can do I'm going to attempt to use this little stick try to get a bulldog ant for our sting test all right got our forceps small container now we just need the bulldog ant itself I'm going to lightly disturb the entryway oh here we go I've got them already that makes me nervous the ants are starting to swarm you see how big they are this is like a volcano of ants oh gosh almost got me they're getting on me all right I'm gonna get our ant fast here we go I got it yes oh man oh there we go we've got one that is a really good sized bulldog ant starting to swarm a little too much to hang out here let's go reposition away from the nest so we can get a closer look at one of the scariest ants in the world Australians fear these massive ants because they attack in swarms and without warning if you accidentally disturb them you can be covered in just a matter of seconds Bulldog ants can be found all over Australia and often build nests in people's yards and local parks which is exactly where we discovered these ants this particular species is one of the largest growing to over one inch in length and of course for this sting test we wanted the big dogs so we could compare how they rank against the legendary bullet ants up South and Central America now it's time to find out which is worse all right guys is officially go time with the bulldog and look at the size of this insect size wise I would definitely say it gives the bullet ant a run for its money but appearance this ant is second to none when it comes to intimidation Factor but before I test the might of this insect let's get it out of the container and take an even closer look at those jaws and it's stinger all right here we go well it's already jumping out I want to be very careful right now and they are so aggressive look at that it's already biting on the forceps I'm just gonna try my best to get a good grip and I'm getting nervous gosh hang on all right I gotta get it on the ground here we go unlike other ants They Don't Really react to scents and pheromones they react to sight so anytime I try to grab it with the forceps it sees that I'm coming there we go okay perfect hold there it is no animal has been requested for a sting test more than the bulldog ant in the history of Brave Wilderness and now I could see why Wow I have never seen a more terrifying looking ant in my entire life let's start at the top look at the size of those mandibles they are like serrated cheers attached to these bulbous eyes almost like a vice grip just ready to snap and pinch on to anything it can touch look at the eyes of the ant you can really see how much it reacts by using its sight look how it turns its head to the different ways that I position my finger around it and then of course before we get to the Stinger I just have to say look at the size of those legs because they are visually stimulated they use their extremely long legs to extend quickly and flick themselves onto any Woody Predators earning them the name Jumping Jacks and then of course we could see the Stinger flying already from the abdomen like other stinging insects only the females can sting this is actually a century or a soldier ant tasked with guarding the front of the nest and you saw with just the slightest disruption a fleet of soldiers came flying out of the nest ready for attack that they got all over my boots and nearly took a sting right away but we saved the sting for this moment in the video The Sting of this ant is said to be one of the most painful experiences that you can get from any animal here on the continent of Australia some even argue in the world the biggest difference between bullet and bulldog and stings are the toxins they use bullet ants use a Panera toxin which is slow building and can last for days where Bulldog ants use formic acid that causes instant pain and when these ants swarm and cover people by the dozens they have the ability to take down a fully grown adult holy cow she's looking at me oh my gosh look at that Stinger go I have a feeling this is going to hurt I'm Mark Vince and I'm about to enter the sting Zone with one of the most terrifying ants on the planet the Australian bulldog ant on three one [Applause] two three ah yeah ah oh God you see the Stinger going in yeah that's a good stink ah yeah oh God's plan look at his Stingers in [Music] all right put it back in the jar oh that hurts all right oh my gosh oh oh my goodness yeah that burns that is a super super intense sting oh my gosh okay hang on let me compose myself oh man that was like instant fire underneath my skin so much more like potent than the bullet ant but I can tell you this the bite was really nothing didn't really get a good grip on with those jaws but it certainly got its stinger stuck in my arm and it getting a little dry now hang on my adrenaline's kicking in you okay Mark yeah I'm all right I think all right geez it's all so hot out all of a sudden all right I think I'm good to continue on oh you bulldog ah all right see that Stinger site got a little bit of a acute swelling maybe some residual bumps and it definitely Burns I would say the initial onset of the sting it was like a lightning bolt way more intense than a bullet ant but I can tell you it's already starting to subside a bit but wow that is a rip shot of pain man really getting dry mouth guys the uh there's a wrapping pen in your backpack it is I've got my EpiPen don't worry okay yeah I don't need it yet but gotta monitor my make sure my tongue's not swelling up or anything but holy cow that sting is like a hammer it's like somebody literally just took a hammer and went Wham instantaneous pain not even a small delay as soon as the Stinger touched my skin boom it was on [Music] oh I hope you enjoyed that one because I don't think I want to go arm to Stinger again with that intimidating Little Ant now I am not out of the woods by any means I'm going to continue to monitor this thing over the next two days I could tell you this a single Sting from a bulldog ant so far does not compete with the bulletin unlike the bullet ant that just started to build and build and build I'm starting to really get past that initial wave of pain and now I'm just really more dealing with the uh the after effects of adrenaline starting to get that like Wheezy stomach cold sweat and just simple nausea that I usually get after taking a sting but a swarm of bulldog ants I would estimate to take even the most pain tolerant person to their knees all right I think I'm gonna need some ice sure enough things got a lot worse just hours later the redness and inflammation flared up and we're joined by an intense itching that lasted for several days compared to other things I've taken this one was a sleeper that turned into a monster bulldog ant stings are known for their instant pain so I was shocked when I was hit with these delayed reactions while I did not experience the 24 hours of deep bone break pain that the bullet ant gave me ah oh oh that is searing pain this was far from an ordinary walk in the park in fact as of the editing of this video my arm is still discolored and healing if I were to have been swarm and stung like the stick in the beginning of the video it would have been a very bad situation but now I know exactly why Australians go so far out of their way to avoid the jumping tear that is the Bulldog Inn yikes"

      "corpus": "It's spring. Rob and Brenda are out enjoying the nice weather. It was a beautiful day in California, so we went for a two mile open water swim and got done with a swim. And I could just start to feel like I was getting the goosebumps on my body. I just thought maybe we just had a cold. I just think I should just go home and lie down. Later that day, Brenda checks on Rob. I felt his forehead. He felt warm. And then I grabbed the thermometer and took the temperature. And I was like, oh, my gosh, you have 104 degree temperature. I was starting to get nervous because I'd always heard that high temperatures like that can be really dangerous. I said, Let's cool you down. Let's get you upstairs into the bathtub. He was really weak at that point, so it was hard to kind of pry him away from the couch. And I had to kind of be aggressive and say, Rob, go upstairs. Brenda finally gets Rob into the bathroom. I remember. I was just brutal getting in that water, that's for sure. The bath does help to bring down Rob's temperature. And that night he's able to get some rest. But the following morning his fever is back, along with another new symptom. I started develop like really bad headaches. It felt like my head was put in a vise grip and somebody would just kept turning the vise grip and kept turning the vise grip and kept turning it and just my head was just going to be crushed. It was just. Just a god awful feeling. Given its severity, His wife Brenda, takes him to the doctor. Rob explained the symptoms. The doctor narrowed it down to with this sort of ice pick type of headache. And he said it's it seems like it's a cluster headache. Cluster headaches are a series of relatively short but extremely painful headaches that reoccur every day for weeks or months at a time. I was like, Huh, That's really strange because he's never gotten headaches before. And so the doctor said, Well, why don't you you guys go home, see how he's doing overnight? And then if he still has a fever and isn't feeling well, then let us know tomorrow. But by the next morning, Rob's condition hasn't improved. So Brenda takes him back to the doctor. Rob said the only thing it makes me feel better, Brenda, is if I just have a bag of ice on my head. So we got the bag of ice and he was holding it on his head while we were waiting in the waiting room. I was extremely worried. We've been traveling and I was starting to get worried that it was related to our trip. Eventually a doctor comes to look at Rob and is immediately concerned. He just looked at me and he said, Somebody of your health should not be sitting in my waiting room with a bag of ice on your head. The doctor tells Brenda to take Rob straight to the hospital. Where he's examined by another team of physicians. I said, Well, maybe it is something from when we were traveling. But the doctors pay little attention to Brenda and instead focus on Rob's high fever and stabbing headaches. No one seemed to take it seriously that we had been traveling. The doctor basically said he seems to be really dealing with something more in his head. Suspecting a neurological issue, the doctors order a round of tests to look more closely at Rob's brain. I got MRIs done MRIs, ultrasounds, CAT scans, everything. But the results failed to provide answers. So doctors admit Rob for observation and further testing. And that night, while Rob is sleeping, his condition takes a bizarre turn. I remember thinking that there are people kind of running around the room. It was just like a guy with a spear kind of thing running around. Things were getting worse and getting worse quickly. It was frightening. The next morning when doctors hear about Rob's hallucinations, they have a new theory as to what's wrong with him. They said, oh, well, we think he might have meningitis. Meningitis is the inflammation of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord. It can be caused by a virus or in some cases, a parasite. I was feeling really scared for Rob. The doctors do a spinal tap, but it doesn't provide any answers. And they ruled out meningitis. They still were at a loss as far as what was happening. It was a really frustrating. Over the next few hours as doctors struggle to figure out what's wrong, Brenda notices a sharp turn in Rob's health. Rob's Skin. Looked gray. It looked like the blood was draining out of him. And the doctor said there's an onset of liver failure and kidney failure. I started to get resourceful and call as many people as I could to say, My husband's in the hospital. My husband's. I cry just like my husband is dying. And there's I can't get any help. I've tried to do everything I can. Can you please help me? Through a friend. Brenda is put in touch with a physician who studies infectious diseases. Dr. Charlie Evans. He got a call from Brenda who said that her husband was hospitalized and wasn't getting better and was concerned that he wasn't getting a proper treatment. Dr. Evans explains that it's hard to say what could be wrong with Rob without seeing his medical information and lab results. So Brenda goes over to the nurses station. I asked the nurse, Can I have Rob's medical records? And at that point she said, No, I'm sorry, that's confidential information. And I said, Well, I'm his wife. I'd like to see his records. But the nurse won't hand them over. So Brenda does something drastic. When the nurse walked away, I took the medical record. I started flipping through trying to find pages of information that had what looked like labs on it. Brenda sends the results to Dr. Evans and he pours over the information until he comes across something troubling. He had evidence of pneumonia. I was concerned about that. Dr. Evans goes back to Brenda for more information, including any recent trips her and Rob have taken. Brenda was was a very serious historian about telling me about where they had been. I explained that we had just gotten back from Costa Rica. For Dr. Evans. It's the missing piece of the puzzle. Just knowing where he had been gave me a good suspicion that we were dealing with an unusual disease that we don't see very often in this country. Dr. Evans believes Rob's body is under attack from a deadly intruder. Based on Rob's symptoms I suspected he had. Leptospirosis."

      "corpus": "with the odds stacked against me here I'm leaving Alaska and going down to the Columbia River on the Oregon Washington border here they have a large population of white sturgeon and I'll have a much better chance of catching one this will be another first for me I've never caught a white sturgeon before and I hear they can put up an incredible fight this line although it's very fine is actually uh it actually has a breaking strain of 100 pounds uh it's braided line the thing about this is though it's nice and supple so uh you know that's not going to sort of drag a lot in the water but another thing about it is it's got well it's got no stretch virtually no stretch compared to nylon monofilament normal fishing line and what that means is if I hook a big fish with this I haven't got that elasticity of the line you know I'm gonna feel everything very very directly up here so you know it's going to be quite a physical um struggle with a fish on this gear so just one final detail of what we're using here is a is a barbless hook there's no Barb on there and that's very much about just sort of looking after the fish I'm going to drop this bait into about 80 feet of water so there we go it's fully rigged I think it's still sinking it's going down that 80 foot of water and that will just bump there we just bump the bottom there bring it in there that's fine oh that's a bit of a knock again there a bit of a knotless there's something definitely interesting all right [Music] it's at that point where all you're imaginings about what's under the water they are well they're starting to take shape whatever it is is on the end of that line but that line is so fine the water here is pretty deep 70 foot or so I'm attached to something there it is there it is there it is there it is my first white sturgeon and the animal I think can easily grow to become a lake monster so I just bring it up and then look out while taking the hook out my chance to finally see the Monster up close eludes me that was a very very brief contact with the animal there I was leaning over the side that was I couldn't reach out as far as I wanted the sturgeon are clearly here and that one was about five feet long but I want a larger one white sturgeon can grow to about 20 feet in there it's not long before I get my next bite and this one feels much bigger [Music] and this fish could be bigger than I am when the fish wants to go I'm letting it go but I'm letting it go Under Pressure it's having to work for the line it takes away and then when the fish takes a bit of a breather I'm hoping you know in those little gaps I can gain a wee bit of line I think we might have to might be an idea to cast off Jack I think it might help if we cast off this is a long long run we're running out of line here we're running out of line and this goes quick we're on the backing we're on the back end wait a minute wait a minute [Music] if you have a look at this look at this line This is the backing I think I may have hooked a monster but I'm running out of line that's the end of my line there off the Reel I want to get the proper line back on the reel right there we are we've got the line back on the Reel here that was Harry I was watching my line going that light that Line's coming up on the water that's the fish that's the fish there it is there we go there we go there we go there we go seeing the fish now that is certainly a big fish it's taken me half an hour to bring this sturgeon in knowing that this is only around half the length they can grow to I now totally believe that a larger one could drag a tree stump into the water that was a tiring fight I've caught some big fish and fresh water this is probably this is probably the biggest freshwater fish I've caught uh about 300 pounds this one just you know a real monstrous fish that's actually 105 or even 106 inches that's eight foot ten inches nearly nine foot nearly nine foot this way it's quite a thought that's one and a half times me at nine feet this fish is roughly 80 years old but they can live to over a hundred this looks big in the water but these things grow to 20 foot possibly even more and I mean just imagine seeing that in the water I mean you could be forgiven for saying that was a monster up to 20 feet long matches all the descriptions I've heard about the monster including Robin's plus the pectoral fins on the long streamlined body fit how she described what she saw but what about the teeth marks on the propeller the mouth here no teeth in there at all I can put my put my hands in there see it's almost it's very telescopic you can imagine that just standing and literally just sucking in a small fish having only gums means it couldn't have been teeth marks on the propeller but I think I know what caused them and what's interesting about a sturgeon it hasn't got a bony skeleton the way we have or the way most other fish has it's just got cartilage but what it has got it's got bony plates on the outside of the body not totally covering it but just in rows and these are you know some form of protection they really are you know sort of quite tough bits of bone there we go and also very bony head very bony Gill flap as well I believe Bill triffon's parents actually ran over a white sturgeon and the propeller going over its bony plates caused what looked like teeth marks it may not have any teeth but this mouth is perfectly formed for being a bottom feeder eating mollusks and small fish this would explain why it is so rarely seen on lake iliamna or lake Clark thanks for watching if you enjoyed this video don't forget to like the River Monsters page thank you"

      "corpus": "y'all have been loving the fishing for giant bass in small pond videos so we are back at it with another one but today it is with swim baits I went to a pond that I haven't been to in three years and boy did we smack the best you're on private property that's all there we go boys it's a nice one yeah there we go boys oh it's a nice one let's go oh gosh giant dude right under the bridge look at that today we're fishing for giant Bass with swim baits and small ponds just like this one this is where we're starting off today we got our mock Shadow right here one of my favorite little swim baits very versatile you can catch a ton of fish on it big ones and small ones that's what I love about this got a beautiful paint job on it this one actually has some green on top some pearl white on the bottom and the sharp hooks as usual on the bait I got it paired up on my kick in their bass TV X loose combo if you guys want to check these out kicking their bass.com I have it linked down below and also with the mock Bates on my discount code I'll pop it up on the screen let's go ahead and get started and see if we can catch some fish in this pond on the old mock Shad I think we're gonna get smashed today guys I'm excited about it this isn't the only Pond that we're gonna fish today by the way we're gonna go to a bunch of different ones but this is just where we're starting off at last couple big bass videos and small ponds we've caught some big bass but we've had to work for him maybe today would be different maybe we'll just end up smoking them everywhere we go I got so much confidence in this mock shad and uh I know we're gonna get some big ones on it especially when the Sun goes down we only have a couple hours today of bass fishing I won't have like a whole day as far as the other episodes have gone but maybe that's going to be even better for this episode maybe we're going to catch them at the hot time just smoke a ton of fish it's actually a pipe right here that I've never seen before I might get lucky right here like a big one could be sitting out in front of a pipe before we get deeper into this video only 27 percent of you all watching these videos are actually subscribed so if you could take the time hit the Subscribe button really helps the channel I'd appreciate it I just got destroyed oh my gosh slam the back of it just didn't get the hook there see if we can get him to come back oh my gosh come on now at least we got some activity early wow just straight up swirled on it felt him just tap the back end of it he just didn't commit over the tree branch and I'm freaking out it's the worst case scenario right now boys oh my God exactly what I didn't want you know what sucks is this would be so easy to get but this tree fell so just totally I didn't even realize this tree was falling over here dude come on you come off oh my God it came off dude thank God make sure we're good here yeah we're set man I could have been very bad well now there's definitely not a fish on that tree so it has been a couple years since I've been out to this Pond and it used to be really good but they actually drained this place and when they were draining it I actually came out and fished it it still caught a few fish but I want to say a ton of fish died and I don't really know what that means for this place I just haven't came back and fished it ever since they drained it because I just assumed you know hey the fish are done here let's hope that there's still some good bass in here and maybe uh the population's back up to how it used to be uh was he coming after me oh dude he freaking boiled right up on the bank that's a good sign that had to have been a fish what else I could have been okay we saw some activity that's important one just swam off the bank I'm pretty sure that's a Dame bed and that's a fish on bed and I had a fish what okay hold on hold on hold on let's pause for a minute I had a fish trying to eat me the whole time as I'm distracted by this other fish hold on boys that fish is on bed dude he just put it in his mouth here we go here's first fish he's gonna ding bed fish with a mock shy what is going on are we gonna actually find these fish on bed it's awesome to see him reproducing where'd he goes he's still yeah he's still there now he's just iffy on me sees me we're gonna keep on going guys that fish is pretty small it ain't like he's big but that is insane to see a fish on bed right now I haven't seen a fish on bed in probably a month oh no oh nothing I missed them I knew they're in this corner I watched this boil come up maybe he'll bite it again Bank up there oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah there we go boys oh it's a nice one let's go let's go dude let's freaking go Macha baby let's get it look at that that's a healthy fish oh dude it's on boys it is on look at how he ate that thing too beautiful fish wow this is about to be good that is an awesome sign right there he missed it the first time he came back he really wanted it all right fish I need you to come off so we can keep catching them I'll take one hug off other one goes on there we go beautiful one right there two and a half pounder and about a one pound frame that's insane thank you buddy what a star boys it's about to go down get ready prepare yourselves so we've got to get another one here I feel it it's also bait running this Bank that's right when I threw this in and instantly I saw a big boil behind it so right when you throw this bait out there if you reel it in pretty fast you could see the Ripple and then if a bass starts telling it you can just see you can see his whole beeline coming up behind the beige is just so fun man oh my gosh I got drilled I had him hooked too gosh boys we gotta we gotta quit messing up I'm not paying attention see if we can give him the bite again [Music] I'm not totally bummed out that we missed these fish a couple of them we definitely should have landed what's that can I help you may I help you okay I can walk on down I'm gonna go that way on the other side where there's no houses no I want it all I'll walk wide so I can get away from him oh my God it's a nice one oh my gosh he choked it too let's get him off the hook I'm gonna walk on down by this other side of the pond look at how he ate that thing man oh my goodness that one totally crushed it right there look at that one that's another good a little two and a half pounder there that's a beautiful one he actually ate it out in the middle oh that's beautiful nice boys all right so we're gonna walk down and get out of these people's way we're gonna go down to the other side of this Pond there's no houses or anything stay out of people's way we're on board this Pond is hot too right now I'm actually gonna walk on this other side to where I can get away from the house this lady just go she acted a little upset but she was you know a little extra there but I'm gonna respectfully walk on I've actually fished this Pond for years guys probably been about six years now that I've been fishing this Pond I never really have any problems I might have once or maybe one time before um but they ended up being really cool but uh I'm gonna get out of this person's way so I don't upset them last thing I want to do is have a situation and then I can't come back here you know how that goes boys so we're gonna get out of their way she came off a little a little crazy though it's a little crazy it's all right we'll walk away from the situation and we're going to keep on smacking the bass that is our plan today listen we ain't gonna get upset we ain't gonna get all crazy we're gonna stay positive keep a good attitude and we're going to keep on catching them and I'm so excited about this Pawn this is just it's just so exciting for me guys I haven't been here in years I thought this Pond was just done honestly and to catch two fish that were like two and a half pounds that is the sign that we need that there's some big bass in here this looks even better I don't even need to be on that side of the pond now so one thing that actually came out of that lady coming out in her backyard was I caught a fish during that whole scenario okay and I want you guys to understand the reason I caught that fish so I threw out in the middle just like that I wasn't burning it you know this whole time I've been working it pretty fast if I can remember correctly I was turned around slightly reeling this bait and that's when I got the fish to bite so maybe we slow this thing down maybe that's what we've been missing this whole time we might have just been reeling it a little too aggressive for today oh oh my god oh it's a monster boys we got a monster on let's get it this is the size that we want yeah let's get it boys my Chad putting in the work oh my goodness come here baby get you out of the mud oh let's get it solid three pounder that is a start man I thought she was like four freaking pounds hopping out of that water bill I'll take her all good healthy bass man oh my goodness this Pawn's back home boys he's back home man look at that who took that advice that we got earlier oh my God that could have been that could have been horrible matter of fact that could have been not the move okay we're gonna get this fish back in the water solid girthy three pounder beautiful fish the size we want that's the side well actually what we really want is in five plus Pounders but I will take some three Pounders all day long to work up to that giant if you guys have noticed anything with these fishing for Giants and small pond videos we have just had to work our way up the ladder you know we stay positive we stay confident and it ends up happening we just got to sometimes be patient and today is one of those days we might just have to be patient keep casting we caught a couple two and a half Pounders and a three pounder now's about our time for about a four pounder and then we can work to that five six seven pounder range you gotta keep being patient it's gonna happen these fish are in here they seem to be biting they're liking what I'm putting down with a swim bait I think we're gonna catch a ton oh he's big dude oh my gosh I can't tell how big this fish is but he's large I think I got them hooked over here swimming at me oh my gosh she's not even that big I'm on top of the head that fish seemed huge there he is all right buddy you can go you can go there you go self release dude I thought that was a tank that fish felt monstrous between the boil I should have thought something was up you know with him not coming to the top of the water and not being able to see him oh man that's funny he sure felt big though I know you guys laughing at me right now Noah you're always freaking out over two pound fit listen man I just love it dude I get excited okay you ain't getting excited while fishing I don't know what to tell you I just love it guys I get happy I get excited you know sometimes I get a little over excited but it's okay man at least I'm doing it for a good reason by the way boys I am going to keep the volume a little low oh my goodness man that was a small one I'm not big at all it was like a pound and a half if that should be one in that little pocket oh when he just came up oh come on dude he's not committing oh my gosh what are these fish doing some of them are just choking it completely and some of them are just swirling on it so that's a fish that should bite again technically if he's interested enough I didn't stick him he didn't get it get the bait in his mouth at all it just kind of showed himself oh another one right there oh I just literally when I pause it he ate it when I started reeling it it just spooked him off [Music] oh dude I'll watch them eat it oh my God Guys these fish are so healthy this is just unbelievable here the bite that we're getting on oh my gosh okay buddy calm down and the crazy part about it they're smoking this mock shot in this Pond guys but we have a different Pawn that we're gonna hit after this and I'm gonna try to time it right when the sun's going down I think it could be definitely something to it to catch some big fish there we go another solid like two two and a half pound bass pretty man thank you buddy I literally watch that one eat it that's the cool thing about the swim bait fishing the top water fishing's so excited because you can see it but with this mock Shad you guys have to go get one just to see the movement of it but the slitherness through the water just looks so good maybe I can put it here if you guys could see that see it just looks beautiful and uh I was reeling it back and right when I paused it you could just see that bass just dive over it it looks so awesome this water's fairly clear in here it's good to see the water visibility get better too when they drain this Pond it was literally yeah it was orange guys the water was so nasty and dirty I don't know how they got this Pond back up and going but uh whoever did I congratulate them because they turned this place around big ass let's do it oh dude he was literally oh my gosh dude that fish was literally putting it in his mouth I couldn't feel it if it wasn't for me looking at that fish in my eyes I would have never knew he bit my bait oh my God this is acting so weird looks like a bed right there oh my gosh I literally landed on his head and he just ate it I was so sick he's not big at all but that was awesome that's a freaking cool bite right there to be honest I thought I was stuck on grass I mean the bait landed I pulled it off the grass and then it was just and he was instantly on there he didn't give me a second to do anything I was just straight up hooksetting them thank you for the bite buddy you're not big you're definitely our smallest one today but still appreciate the nibble if there's a definition of a nibble on the swim bait today that's probably it there yes we've just done it all nothing makes sense cannot believe we're catching them on bed too that's so sick that's the hard part with today too it's kind of cloudy out it's not Sunny so it's hard for me to see all these spots I can't really lay an eye on all these areas or any of these beds like I might be able to see them if they're really glowing other than that it's really hard for me to see oh is that a good one nice not bad oh look at this fish he's just the jumpiest one let's go we're just gonna keep it cranking boys look at how he ate it see he wanted it and they eat it like that and they got both hooks in their mouth and you got that mock shot just hanging out that's how you know they want it this guy he was not playing around it feels like these small ones are just so much more aggressive they're trying to get fat they're trying to get up they're trying to get like the grown-ups out in this Pond he's probably a little bit bigger than the last one just because of the the fat belly on him but he ain't much to show thank you for biting me keep it rolling keep it rolling before they drain this Pond I would only catch fish in specific areas of this pond now I feel like I'm catching fish all over which it could be because they're pushed up right now you know that could be definitely one of the reasons but at the same time I just feel like I'm catching fish where I would have never caught fish before before they drained this place if anybody knows much about draining ponds and uh bringing it back from that I'm telling you I need to try to go find some pictures I have a video of us fishing this place when it was drained and it was honestly sad man because I knew how good of a fishery this place was and I thought it was done forever oh vegan that's a big that's the biggest one today boys oh my gosh he steamrolled past that bank to get that fish come on he's our second biggest oh that's a nice one good good stuff right there oh man that fish is almost three pounds he ain't as big as that three pounder recall in that corner but he's up there he's got such a skinny body or he's got such a long body but his whole body's not filled out I'm gonna show you guys here see this one ate it he wanted it he went after it so if you guys notice super fat belly pretty decently sized head there and then he's got a little bit of lacking weight in his tail there's still a good fish overall that's our second second biggest today very heavy I wish you guys could feel this fish definitely three pound fish in a two pound body with how fat he is here he goes man we just can't stop just throwing parallel with that bank that's all that was very simple that's one thing guys when you're coming down the ponds like this just throw parallel with the bank that's one thing that you can do to catch a lot more fish it doesn't really matter the time of year I always always try it there's a lot of points where those fish are going to be out in the middle you know whether it's summertime or whether it's in the winter and they're getting in those little crevices to drop offs of the pond but for the most part something I always do it doesn't matter what time of year I'm fishing is walking and casting and throwing parallel so what I mean by that is I'm parallel with the bank right here I'm just throwing a cast down it so pretty much you're in the strikes in the whole time a majority of these fish today have came up Shallow between 5 and 10 foot off the bank so pretty much that seven foot cast right there off the bank is pretty much the strike zone that I've noticed obviously certain areas of this Pond I'm gonna fish a little deeper like back in that pocket and then out in the main water out here and uh we're obviously gonna catch a lot of fish but one thing to do is just always walking past third parallel don't miss these opportunities Hi how are you yes ma'am it's bass yeah they're just it yeah no it wasn't a bad one um I caught one that was a little bigger but yeah no there's some good ones I know they drained this place you know a couple years back and I didn't know if it was gonna you know mess with the fishing because I've been fishing here for a long time but they're still good they're healthy yeah I know he was yeah no thank you thank you thank you I appreciate it you have a good night what a kind lady it's just crazy guys the the Opposites of people you'll see I know everybody's different but and I and I totally understand some people not wanting me to fish near their house like I totally get it like I'm so with them on that but at the same time you know I do this for a living that's what I'm gonna do I'm trying not to bother anybody oh my dude right under the bridge look at that oh my gosh that is awesome not a big one by any means but a pretty one wow it's a little pounder definitely a downsize from the last one but still a pretty fish there we go boys not much to show but a fun fight that was cool was that oh I just let him go oh I could have grabbed them yeah it was just a little Bass yeah there's so many I'll tell you I I've fished it a lot over the last how are y'all I know they drained the pond a few years back remember when they did that and it worried me because I was like I don't know if the fish would survive that but it let me tell you they seem like they're almost yeah I wouldn't either yeah I know that was neat I might be able to get another one here they're biting really good look at that boys gosh I'm getting these casts perfectly on this other side of the bank I'm just gonna Coast them in he choked it see that's exactly how one should eat it this ain't even a big one see this is the one fish that's actually yeah this one's a little smaller no he ate it really good though a little skinnier you know yeah yeah no he's still healthy I will say a lot of the other ones were fatter than this one but I'm a pretty one [Music] there he goes all right guys we're going off to the other side of the pond and we're gonna fish for just a little bit longer in this place I'm actually gonna save it for another episode because I want to come out here with some different baits I think we can really put in some work not saying the mock Shad can't catch them because we're smoking them they're just eating it they're tearing it up but um met a couple awesome people that are there super nice super kind and uh just out here enjoying life guys enjoying some fishing it's a beautiful day to be outside and that's what it's about we're going to go ahead and throw a few more casts over here though before we head off to this next spot let's try to get one giant before we leave here I know we can do it oh my gosh watch this watch this watch this oh my God he just freaking ate my tail bro oh my God I wish you guys could see this I'm watching this fishes play with this bait oh man he came right out of that pipe we gotta be careful guys one thing that I don't like you guys already know what I don't like I don't know Mitch we just got a tiny bit of daylight left so I'm actually gonna take it over to this other pond in hopes that we're gonna get something pretty large on this I think we could continue fishing this Pond and catch a good bit of fish but I kind of want to go try a new place you know I don't want to stay in the same Pond the whole night as the sun's going down for this last 30 minutes I think this other Pond could produce a really big one I think the big ones will start roaming up Shallow here as we speak right now and uh and I think we're gonna end up catching a giant guys so stay tuned all right guys you know where I be back at the old juice hole we've been killing them in this pond I wanted to come back just for the afternoon bite because I feel like that's when this place heats up oh my God that was a huge boil bro I might be able to catch this fish oh my God that was quick man goodness that was so fast all right boys I'm excited about this we just got a capitalize that's all we got to do and I got him is he big I can't tell oh no okay that was such an awkward like hook set and everything smallest fish today officially did you hear what I said I said officially buddy all right smallest one today he's a little fat like that small one in the other pond was definitely bigger but this fish was fatty but that is one fish something is on fire because it smells like straight bonfire foreign [Music]"

      "name": "Mark Rober",
      "corpus": "I cut my finger making lunch so I placed an order for some Band-Aids a couple minutes ago and now they're four seconds away that is a nearly silent drone system that can deliver a package from the sky right to my backyard in as little as two minutes with dinner plate accuracy and as far as I am concerned that's basically teleportation this is the very near future of package delivery from a company called zipline it's been over a decade since we were first promised drone delivery that looked like this and to be honest I was never that stoked about it because I couldn't imagine that anyone would actually want something that big and loud with dangerously fast spinning propellers Landing anywhere near their house and that was a bummer because with the explosion of people using Amazon or food delivery apps like doordash or instacart billions of doorstep deliveries are now happening every year but when your lunch only weighs a few ounces driving it to everyone with these two-ton gas powered vehicles is wildly inefficient bad for the whole planet and not to mention just really slow drone delivery would not only take a lot of cars off the road but it would be a lot faster than a car it would be fully electric fully autonomous and it would cost pennies worth of energy G per delivery and with zipline because the Droid that lowers the package can move laterally in any direction it can make a dartboard sized Precision Landing even in high winds while the main drone can stay 400 feet up in the sky making the whole thing whisper quiet that is very quiet also due in part to the clever design of these really funky propellers as you all know I only make about 10 videos a year and while most are just sort of ridiculous I like to dedicate one video to Showcase how clever people are using engineering to change the world for the better and to be clear the company I'm talking about today is not sponsoring this or paying me in any way I'm just really impressed by the work that they're doing and how they're doing it so we'll Circle back in a minute to exactly how they're going to pull off deliveries using these short-range drones in a city but it begs the question if they can make it work there why not use gliding drones to cover longer distances to deliver critical medical supplies for countries with lots of remote Villages well as it turns out catapulting life-saving blood through the skies is what they've already been doing for over six years which is why we need to head out to Rwanda to understand where this all started and immediately after showing up we were right in the thick of it as drones were taking off and Landing as another one lands every 90 seconds they're coming from everywhere and as a newcomer it felt a bit chaotic but if you're gonna rack up 40 million miles worth of drone flights your team needs to be operating with the efficiency of an F1 pit crew so here's a crash course on how it all works it all starts with an order coming in from a doctor at a hospital say for example for an emergency supply of blood then once it's all packed up it gets passed out to be placed in the belly of the Drone and then the whole thing is placed on the launcher at that point they attach the wings and secure the battery followed by the nose cone then after some pre-flight safety checks they launched the Drone all within 90 seconds of the order coming in the Catapult launcher takes the Drone from zero to 65 miles an hour in a third of a second which is literally less time than it takes you to Blink and it's a pretty clever design too because it means the Drone immediately starts at its cruising speed where it takes much less energy to stay airborne then once it's in the air cruising at 70 miles per hour it navigates its way to the hospital and upon arriving opens the trap door to drop the package which lands safely using a parachute having not completed the mission it continues making all its own decisions to autonomously navigate back home from as far away as 150 miles round trip then taking inspiration from an aircraft carrier as the Drone approaches the military-grade GPS broadcast its position within one centimeter so these two pools know exactly when to swing up at the last possible moment snagging a hook on the tail with the cable which safely slows it down then once it settled to a stop the crew comes in to remove the battery and wings and it all goes back into rotation the whole thing is really impressive and Incredibly robust which means it works in pretty much any weather and because there's no human steering it it has no issues flying at night so they run the operation 24 hours a day which is how in six years they've managed to make those half a million often life-saving deliveries that is the uppermost top of the iceberg tip of how they're doing what they're doing but what you should know is six years ago all the experts told them this was a hopeless cause and failure was a near certainty and they kind of weren't wrong building an engineering product took time so you prototype you you know you build it and then you fail and then you try again and you fail to try again until you have the shiny product that you want this is a different type of aircraft this is not what we had the first one used to land on these inflated mattresses the vehicle had a hook on the back you had to tell the tail will deployed an aircraft carrier yeah and then the fishing pole will pull it no land on the mattress first of all he's not saying that figuratively they were early days using actual fishing poles as you can see here and secondly this is Abdul and what you should know about Abdul is he grew up in Rwanda and from where these drones are launching and while he would he would Stamford and Harvard he got his start in engineering for much more simple means I remember that I would make cars from milk boxes that you know was left over you know we add tires there and use it as a car Abdul was orphaned as a child when he lost both of his parents and all three of his siblings in the Rwandan Genocide narrowly escaping himself but he didn't give up on his passion for engineering and so as he got older he would go around to all the local hospitals fixing their MRI machines for free using knowledge he gained from watching YouTube videos Abdul was the very first zipline employee in Rwanda and he really helped to Pioneer so many of the systems they have in place today that are now used all over the world and so in an effort to test those very systems I wanted to see if it was robust enough that even a total Noob like me could send out an order oh [Music] good enough this is where the blood is right it's O positive I feel like I shouldn't be touching this stay calm that's the number one rule scan it scraps like this five okay just out here saving lives and once I ring the bell it's the Drone team's problem okay what do I do and push it here out of my way I'm coming through the wings how's that better we're trying to be thick there's so many so after a final check of the drone's condition a little bit of a look to the right and cough [Applause] I'm a hero we did it I just like saved the life basically wow how do you guys do this all day long so now that I had a pretty good feel for the launch site we headed out to see where some of these drones were actually flying to so we left the launch site like three and a half hours ago we're driving to this remote Hospital on these really windy roads and as we've been driving we've been tracking and seeing some of these zipline drones delivering blood and medical supplies to this hospital so since we're about a half hour out I thought it would be fun to place my own emergency order then it could meet us when we get there because when you need extra ointment you just need extra ointment and sure enough a few minutes after arriving I Got a notification for an incoming package this is wild because we're like four hours away on some really windy roads [Music] I got it [Music] close close and so after opening the package and checking their handiwork I asked if I could speak to a few of the doctors when's the last time you delivered a baby in few minutes ago a few minutes ago that's pretty fresh for the doctors it was like a miracle with zipline we are sure that in 15 to 20 minutes we are going to get what we need and you were sure that patient will be safe but it wasn't just the doctors who were big on zipline I also spoke with a handful of patients who for various different reasons are all alive today because of a zipline delivery every time when I sit the drones around I just think that someone's life is going to be saved and that's kind of true because their drones have reduced in-hospital maternal mortality by 88 zipline has two launch sites that give them coverage for pretty much anywhere in Rwanda but they also have operations running in all of these countries and while they serve 3 000 hospitals globally today that number will be ten thousand by the end of the year all right so we've covered their long-range country delivery drones which means we've now got the context to talk about their short-range City Delivery drones but first I just have to interject here and say I was blown away by Rwanda as a country I mean right out of the gate their stop lights are really cool because they're just countdowns till the light turns green they can balance and carry pretty much anything on their heads and there's motorcycle taxis everywhere and given that win in Rwanda you do as the rwandans do whenever possible that's how we got around ourselves everyone was also super friendly everywhere we went well not everyone because if you stop to play soccer with some random kids all right guys just know they're not going to take it easy on you seems to like it before traveling there the only real thing I knew about Rwanda was the Rwanda genocide that took place about 30 years ago and while there are still plenty of Battle Scars as horrific as that was it sort of galvanized the country into a period of healing and solidarity as a single Rwandan people instead of divisive ethnic groups for example on the last Saturday of the month literally everyone spends the day picking up trash and volunteering in their local communities and that's one of the reasons you hardly see litter anywhere the other one being 15 years ago they were one of the first countries to ban all single-use Plastics there was just a pervasive optimism in the air everyone was moving with the purpose everywhere we went not just working hard but working smart with their resources on hand including their improvised soccer balls for over a decade attending school up to age 16 has been both mandatory and free and when you combine that with leapfrogging to new technologies like drone delivery for the last decade their economy has been growing at four times the rate of the U.S economy while their violent crime rate has been 15 times less than the US and finally the most unducing part of the whole trip was when I hiked to see an entire family of mountain gorillas up close in the wild which was equal parts adorable and terrifying thank you you got me mountain gorillas only exist in these two tiny red regions and while there's only a thousand left in the world I got to just chill with 20 of them they're critically endangered but thanks to Rwandan conservation efforts funded by people paying for brief visits like this their numbers have climbed by 200 over the past decade all that's to say that besides of course my own country Rwanda is my new second favorite country we got this and next time I go back I'm bringing a bunch of soccer balls oh yeah which I will give away to any kid who just promises not to embarrass me okay so now let's talk a little bit more about these new short-range city drones because for the 4 billion doorstep deliveries that will happen this year in the US and that number doesn't even include Amazon by the way why not at least try and take some of those slow-moving traffic causing two-ton gas guzzling cars off the road in exchange for a much faster delivery that's also electric autonomous really quiet in zero emissions and while the solution of dropping down a Droid that could perfectly control its Landing from super high up seem promising and way better than something like this that had been proposed before when they first told me about it I had two main questions one how loud and disruptive are they because the last thing we want are annoying drones buzzing by our rooftops all day and two how safe are they because the other last thing we want is for those same annoying drones to start falling down on us from the sky outside of bonus third question around how a business is even supposed to load in their items for delivery and so in a search for answers I went right to their headquarters not that far down the road from where I live and the first thing you notice in the lobby is this really cool projection that not only shows the total number of flights they've flown now at over half million but it also shows all the long-range drones they have in the air at that exact moment delivering those critical medical supplies all around the world and this isn't now just where they design and build all their drones it's also where they do a lot of their testing and they test pretty much everything in every way possible before getting it out to the field as quickly as possible and according to their CEO Keller this is something they discovered early on our key Insight was we were dumb and we basically always assumed we were dumb and for that reason when we designed things we got them into the real world super fast and learned by serving real people and you learn so much that you can't learn in a lab or in an ivory Tower and so before we actually hear just how quiet these things are I just want to Echo that all the best Engineers I've ever known have had that same level of humility knowing there's no better way to learn than to test and to break stuff that's why I named the toy company I started that has the express School of teaching kids to think like Engineers crunch Labs it's because they things are supposed to Crunch and to break and to fill along the way and so if I could get them to do more than just passively watch a video by building something alongside me while we talk about the physics of what's going on then I know that principles will really sink in so if you want to have a ton of fun while building up that resiliency in your brain like a muscle just head to crunchlabs.com or use the link in the video description alright so to answer my first question on the noise level I'll just show you my actual reaction to the first time I heard it I mean I hear something that I cannot believe that's Airborne are you serious and I just wish there was a better way to convey this on video but here's my best attempt you'll first hear a leaf blower then a typical hobby drone that weighs one pound then their drone that weighs 50 pounds and of course I've kept the audio levels completely untouched for all three that is whisper quiet that is very quiet that cow is [Laughter] I bet the mic picked up that cow and this test was incredibly surprising to me because I sort of just assumed the weight of a thing would exactly determine how loud the propellers will end up being to keep that thing in the air but it turns out that's not actually true even if you just look at nature pigeons for example sound like this but with owls there's an evolutionary pressure to be as quiet as possible and as a result their flight sounds like this for this reason to crack the code zipline actually did turn to Nature we studied the hummingbird a lot where you have they have the worst case they're tiny and they're really quiet they just they just like hover there you barely hear it by the way that's Keenan he's another zipline co-founder and for your robotics nerds he's the dude who invented Ross which is the open source software used by basically anyone who wants to build anything robotic so whatever to try and visualize the secret of their quiet propellers in this graph the area under the curve could represent the energy from one of those annoying high-pitched hobby drones or the closest of these spikes is the high frequency that's just sort of grading on your ears so after studying the hummingbird and designing really wild looking rotors like this zipline figured out how to take those spikes and flatten them all out so while the extra weight means there's still more energy or area under the curve getting rid of all the spikes means it's much more of a constant whooshing sound more like white noise that your brain just sort of doesn't register they use the same quiet propeller approach for their long-range drones as you can tell from this doctor with an impeccable taste in YouTube content who just wanted to say hot you've seen my videos now you get to be in one have you seen the planes fly over and deliver the supplies here I have not yet seen one come and deposit something here that's amazing there was just 15 deliveries in the last hour not really quiet if I would have heard it I would have you know gone to see it for my second question regarding safety just like when sending something to Mars all their critical systems have backups on board in engineering we call this redundancy and they even demonstrated for us how if one propeller stops working it could still fly due in part to the large back propeller that picks up the slack and that back propeller is pretty clever by the way because it's what propels the Drone forward as it moves across town but then it turns down 90 degrees to help steer and create extra lift while it's stationary and dropping down the Droid in addition to the redundancy a whole aircraft parachute is automatically deployed if there is a problem that's sensed or if the Drone just loses power altogether and because of their painstaking engineering efforts it's worth noting in the six years they've been operating for those half a million flights they've had exactly zero incidents caught causing any injury as for my third bonus question around how the drones get loaded up in the most simple case something like a grocery store could reserve some parking spots as a loading zone or as one of the zipline Engineers told me you can take a window from your local pharmacy and turn it into this portal so the Droid would come down the Chute then some ASAP items like these would get loaded inside then it goes back up the Chute into the Drone and off for delivery for healthcare if you were really sick and say on a 15 minute video call with your doctor by the time the call was ending your medications could be on your back porch so you don't have to leave your house you could also imagine how this could work with a distribution center or a large retail store more than 90 percent of people in the US live within 10 miles of a large retail store and zipline drones conveniently can make a 10 mile round trip while carrying up to eight pounds an additional win for the planet here is you don't need to use all the cardboard to box it up because it doesn't have to survive being shipped out on a big truck but this isn't just for big stores your favorite local shop or restaurant can now more easily afford to send a thing to your door but an ostensibly much slower cost than a person driving a three thousand pound car to drop it off and as soon as by the end of this year customers such as sweet green will start delivering salads straight to your backyard and not having packages left on front porches is the worst news to hit the porch pyre Community since the invention of the glitter bomb Oh all right all right and we get it okay all right so if your mind isn't already blown let me try one final time by planting a seed for something we might see much further in the future and to be clear this is not at all from zipline it's just an idea that won't leave my head after seeing all this because it stands to reason if the system can work for packages it should be able to work for humans right in other words imagine a bigger drone let's say it's an ambulance with more powerful but equally quiet propellers parked so high up in the sky you can hardly see it then it lowers the entire cockpit like the Droid which could quietly touch down in your driveway so you hop in or they put you in on the ground then it reels you in so you can glide above roads and traffic straight to your destination only to be dropped off safely in the same manner alright so finally I just want to wrap up with the coolest part of all of this by far the whole time we were there kids would be lined up at the fence to watch the drones be launched and captured over and and over in fact one kid came up specifically wanting to show Abdul what he built completely on his own and in that moment it was impossible not to compare the complexity of this build to the simple milk carton version Abdul grew up making because here you have Abdul who Bears a scar on his head from the same machete that killed his entire family as a child not only using his engineering knowledge to save the lives of his people but more importantly to inspire the next generation of problem solvers to dream even bigger it's the type of thing that leaves you feeling a little bit of that contagious Rwandan optimism for the future and the incredible potential of us mere humans in the future your crunchlabs box just might come from the sky and the best part of Abdul's story is how using the super power of engineering they literally willed something into existence that is now saving lives and as it says on the box my goal with crunch Labs is to help you think like an engineer that means you know how to think critically and break a problem down into manageable steps thinking like an engineer makes you a better soccer player or piano practicer or Math study or because you're resilient and just like Abdul you know the importance of failing a bunch before you finally hit that break so the way it works is every month a really fun toy comes in a box like this and when you open it there's a link to a video where you not only build it alongside me but I teach you all the juicy physics principles behind how the toy works and the best part of all is each month we randomly select one box to slip in a platinum ticket and if it happens to be your box oh my God [Applause] then you're coming out right here to Crunch labs to design with me and my team for a day so if you want to unlock the superpower of learning to create and build whatever you could dream up use the link in the video description or go to crunchlabs.com and order your buildbox subscription

      "corpus": "There's a story of mine that I've told about a million different times, and it goes a little something like this. When I was 10, my family and I packed up our entire lives into large suitcases and dragged them across the Pacific to a foreign land called Canada. I was put in a school where I was the only Asian kid in my grade, and I got teased for my broken English, Asian features and funny smelling ethnic lunches. The racism was a real doozy. But don't feel bad. Through the magical healing powers of extracurricular activities and pure perseverance, I stand before you today, a new woman: healthy, healed and extremely employable. You wouldn't even be able to tell from just looking at me that I was once the weird little immigrant girl who begged her mom to pack PB&J sandwiches so she wouldn't have to eat lunch alone in the bathroom. This is a story that I\u2019ve told in academic essays, job interviews and even in the very application that got me into this fine university. It's also a story that, despite all of its truth, I've come to hate. Now this is a story that I don't have copyright claim over. It's one that continues to be regurgitated by immigrant kids all across the country to be served on a silver platter to prestigious universities who chew these stories and spit out acceptance letters in return. The contents of the story may change. Instead of a difficult immigration experience, it might be the death of a loved one, a chronic illness or a racist encounter. But what remains constant is the moral: A bad thing happened to me, but it made me a good person. This is part of a larger phenomenon that I'm here to talk about today. The overwhelming pressure being put on high school students to write about their deepest traumas in their college applications with the hopes that they seem resilient and interesting enough to be given a spot. I believe that these are not only bad metrics by which to evaluate applicants, but also incredibly harmful to the storyteller themselves and risks reinforcing existing inequities in higher education. There's also pressure that's being amplified by admissions counselors themselves who play a huge role in influencing what applicants decide to write about. Take, for example, this tip from the MIT admissions blog, where the author compares two different introductions for a potential essay. The first one reads: \"I'm honored to apply for the Master of Library Science program at the University of Okoboji. For as long as I can remember, I've had a love affair with books. Since I was 11, I've wanted to be a librarian.\" The second introduction reads: \"When I was 11, my great aunt Gretchen passed away and left me something that changed my life: a library of about 5000 books. Some of my best days were spent arranging and reading her books. Since then, I've wanted to become a librarian.\" The author notes that the second introduction is much more striking and leaves a much better impression. Consider another tip from collegeessayguy.com, where he advises students  to \u201cget personal.\u201d He says, \"Weirdly, including painful memories and what you learned from them usually helps a personal statement meet the goals of a college application essay. You come off as humble, accessible, likable and mature.\u201d Confessions from admissions officers themselves can also be telling. Aya Waller-Bey, a former admissions officer from Georgetown University, said in a \"Forbes\" article that, \"Within months on the job, I saw how the personal statements of Black and other racially minoritized students differed from those of white applicants. Black students highlighted resilience through stories of survival, while their counterparts wrote casual essays about service abroad and sporting championships. Black students shared their pain, white students shared their passions.\u201d Now, lastly, and perhaps the least reliable source is my own life. I remember feeling this way when I was applying to universities. Like I had no other choice, no other experiences worthy of mentioning and no other merit beyond the fact that I had thrived despite what I had gone through. I even remember worrying that my tale wouldn't be harrowing enough after hearing from a counselor that writing about immigration has become a bit of a cliche because of how overused it is. So what\u2019s the universities\u2019 role in all of this and why are these stories even harmful to begin with? Well, I believe that using your college application essay to discuss your trauma actually doesn't help you process it. And there are a couple different reasons why. First, writing about a difficult experience is, as you may have guessed, difficult. Not only do you have to relive the event itself, but you also have to actively suppress any negative emotions that arise during the process. That kind of emotional labor can be taxing for anybody, but perhaps especially so for these young applicants who haven't had enough time on this world to process the terrible things that have happened to them. For that space to be one in which they're confessing to a faceless stranger who gets to make the most consequential decision of their adolescent life imposes an incredibly heavy psychological burden. I mean, imagine if you walked into your therapy appointment and your therapist tells you that they're not going to respond to anything you tell them except with a rejection or acceptance email sent months later. And also that whatever you tell them will determine the trajectory of your entire academic and professional career. Hard to imagine that being therapeutic. Secondly, the trauma essay makes one assumption that is extremely problematic. It's not always the learning opportunity through which you can gain more confidence or develop better time management skills. Sometimes it's just a sucky thing that really sucks. And asking students to prove how they turn their pain into progress ignores this truth and falls prey to the toxic positivity narrative that everything happens for a reason, ignoring the very valid resentment and anger that many victims still feel. Lastly, the things we write aren't just informed by our experiences, they shape how we view those experiences as well. And if we're writing about our trauma to prove to an admissions officer that we are worthy of a decent education, then it becomes necessary to sanitize our pain, to make it marketable and strategic, to scrub away all the suffering, so all that's left is what will fit into the narrow margins of what is palatable. And this is what I see as being the fundamental contradiction at the heart of the trauma essay. It seems to give the writer free reign on vulnerability, but actually leaves them very little room to be vulnerable. Your story has to be just sad enough that it gains sympathy, but not so sad that it makes you seem beyond help. Just critical enough to inspire change, but not so much that it actually criticizes systemic structures. Just honest enough to seem real, but not so unfiltered that it creates discomfort. The protagonist also overcomes whatever struggle they're facing by the end of the 500 word count, instilling the reader with a sense of optimism that despite our deeply unequal society, it is possible to rise through the ranks and overcome all the \u201c-isms.\u201d This, of course, is not the reality of our world today. And for me, this looked like settling for the familiar story of the stinky lunch, one that's been told so many times that it's devoid of any real meaning, instead of talking about the ongoing social and political disenfranchisement of immigrants, the permanent loss of cultural identity that I suffered, or the sense of disbelonging that still haunts me every time I make a grammar mistake or someone mispronounces my name. These are all struggles that never really go away, but are carefully tucked away in my essay because they don't fit the linear narrative that is being constructed. But how are universities to blame for all of this? I mean, they never explicitly asked students to trauma-dump in their essays, and many admissions experts have actually come out and discouraged discussing explicit trauma in essays. However, I still don't think that universities are blameless. The reason why the trauma essay is so ubiquitous is because it seems to be working. Anne Trubek, who helped low-income high school students at Oberlin College write their essays, expresses the ethical dilemma that she faces. \"By pushing students to reveal their horror stories, I risk taking away their dignity, but by not pushing, I could be hindering their chances of getting into their dream school.\" Whether trauma essays and acceptance letters are actually causally correlated is impossible to tell from the outside. So this could all just be speculation and myth. But in failing to resolutely clear up these speculations and myths about whether trauma essays are rewarded or discouraged, universities are indirectly enabling the rise of the trauma essay and all of its harmful implications. So what are they to do about all of this? Well, first of all, I think that this is a problem that goes much deeper than individual universities, and even perhaps the institution of higher education itself. It's rooted in the cultural obsession with appropriating trauma and making it consumable, as well as the systemic tendency to tokenize oppressed people and their experiences. But there are still things that universities can do to make things better. First, they can be more transparent about their admissions guidelines. If it's really true that they don't want to reward trauma storytelling just for the sake of it, then they should be more forthcoming about this expectation. They could also restructure their prompts to avoid putting pressure on students to talk about past hardships and adversities and instead refocus prompts to ask students about their goals for the future and their academic interests. Secondly, admissions counselors should be trauma-informed and trained in working with BIPOC folk. As the unofficial gatekeepers to the secrets of getting into your dream college, they should wield their power responsibly and not pressure students to talk about traumatic experiences that they're not yet ready to talk about. Lastly -- and this one's for anyone who's actually applying to a postsecondary institution sometime soon -- remember that you are more than the bad things that happened to you. I know that when it seems like every other classmate of yours is writing an essay that could be adapted for an HBO original drama, that you may feel like your experiences are not worth talking about. But I promise that they are. You just have to find your voice and use it. Now as much as I don't want to live that nail-bitingly stressful time of my life ever again, I can't help but wonder: what would I have written about if I got the chance to apply to UBC again? This time absent the pressure to strategically use my immigrant background to gain sympathy points. Maybe I would have written about how I overcame my fear of public speaking and became comfortable with being the loudest voice in the room. Or I could have written about watching trashy reality television is what first sparked my interest in political science. Or maybe I still would have written about my immigrant story because that was a big part of my life journey and still impacts me to this day. But I would have done it on my own terms. Instead of being written as a one-dimensional, trauma-turned-triumph trauma drama, I would have been able to tell a story that actually reflects who I am today and acknowledge the fact that my journey is ongoing and it doesn't begin or end with my racial identity. This is the kind of ownership that I wish for everyone to one day have over their story. And now it's up for universities to decide whether they get to tell it. Thank you."

      "corpus": "we got a new flagship device from Vivo it's the X 90 Pro mine is in legendary black dual SIM card tray 12 gigs Ram 256 ROM what's interesting about this one I mean they kind of indicate by looking at the box here it's going to have an enormous camera section so you also see the co-engineered with Zeiss look at that monster these things have increasingly become cameras that also happen to be phones this one really takes the camera aesthetic to another place completely also in the package USB C2C cables hopefully there's going to be a fast charger in here as well absolutely there is and this one is capable of delivering 120 watts pretty much as fast as it gets let's go ahead and check that animation in a moment but first whoa I don't know if this is the new Champion as far as scale is concerned here you can see the t-star logo of course associated with the Zeiss camera brand flash section up here and then that enormous camera unit with what looks like four separate camera modules and then below there extreme imagination now I actually do appreciate this texture back anything that feels slightly more grippy especially on larger devices now they've kept this little band in the center kind of create a two section provide a little bit more styling and then that band wraps around into the side up on the top professional photography you have some power switch as well as your volume rocker camera setup on the front is going to be symmetrical in the center front facing on the bottom here you can see your usb-c Port as well as your dual SIM card tray let's go ahead and quickly test this 120 watt fast charging and check out the animation and of course we can watch it go up in real time thanks to this 120 watt flash charge fast charger now the other thing I'm noticing now that the display is turned on is we do have a waterfall effect which seems to be making a comeback on Flagship devices so the selfie camera on the front is 32 megapix now the rear camera layout is going to give you well you know what let's just jump right into it so the presets 0.6 1X and two let's go ahead and get our trusty plant in order to illustrate those capabilities we're going to start with 0.6 give you a sense for the ultra wide zero in on the green section of our favorite fake plant move into 1X oh some really nice bokeh going on on One X and then 2x yeah the camera's legit I'm really happy with the uniformity of color temperature here and just my initial feedback I know it's only one image Studio lighting but like the way it's processed is green is just a lot more what it actually looks like there's also a dedicated Zeiss button and this is kind of where they say this partnership comes into play is that Zeiss is more about that natural color maybe I'll go ahead and try that I already thought the plant was kind of represented well take another crack with the Zeiss button on and see if it becomes even more subdued and or natural it definitely does yeah the kind of potency of the green goes down ever so slightly you're having something that's a little bit more flat initially and then you can kind of Take It Whatever Direction you want to go as far as the edits concerned now if I move over to the front-facing camera let's get a sense for the 32 megapixels three two one and I mean it looks like 32 megapixels weird hair test rotational test can shoot up to 8K however that will cap our frame rate at 24 frames at 4K however we can do 60fps and we can do 60fps with standard stabilization this is our typical me making Mo feel uncomfortable while testing he's probably groomed himself he's ready for this are you groomed now 4K what hey man you look pretty good all right I'll take it 4K 60 frame video 60 frames if you didn't know 60 frames I was saying earlier the Zeiss button for color representation give you a little bit more flexibility if you want tremendous flexibility you can get crazy with it inside of the pro section we've also got settings here for portraits see the processing taking place there's Mo isolated from his background and looking extremely cinematic which is mostly the way he wants to look a series of looks and some of them have the Zeiss branding right on there there's a night mode sports mode so a very capable camera refresh is in the smart switch mode however you can lock it at 120 or dial it back to 60 hertz if you want more battery saving all right now let's go ahead and check out some multimedia and see how these speakers sound look at this dog right here what does he want from me he like pet in me please can you better me please that's Otis's voice speakers are good yeah stereo speakers kind of a fun little package here obviously the design here is for those camera lovers look at that you see a guy holding something like this you know they're serious you see that textured back you see that Zeiss logo over there you know something's about to go down Vivo X90 Pro coming in around 730 USD what are you doing buying or selling"

      "corpus": "foreign so here's the thing I used to be able to say cheap phones are getting good and good phones are getting cheap because it was true for a while there but then we started getting these more and more expensive Flagship phones they broke through this thousand dollar price barrier we've got super expensive phones now so I can no longer stand by the second half of that statement but the first half still pretty compelling and so this is the Samsung Galaxy a54 which just came out pretty recently and represents roughly the middle-ish of Samsung's lineup where they've got phones at every price from like 160 bucks all the way up to nearly two thousand dollars and this one actually has a great case to be the best value in the entire lineup I didn't expect to say that but I'm saying it now because I've been using this phone for the past two weeks and it actually delivers very well on a lot of the premium smartphone experience but at literally a third of the price of the flagship from the same company literally this phone MSRP is like 400 450 bucks right now you sign the right contract in the US you can basically get it for free and the flagship that I've been daily driving for like the first half of this year so far is the s23 ultra which retails for twelve hundred dollars still so what I wanted to find out and show you in this video is how close does this a54 get to this s23 Ultra or any of these Mega flagships that are like it because it's definitely not a third of the functionality so I'm breaking this down into five categories because these are my five pillars of a great smartphone build quality display performance camera and battery so I've said before if a smartphone can nail all five of these things then it's a good phone period And as a product goes down in price then you naturally expect it to start to make some sacrifices in some of these areas so right from the top with build quality it gets interesting because Samsung kind of adopted this thing where they use essentially the same design language across their entire lineup to keep it consistent and recognizable by but that also basically means that this 1200 phone does not look dramatically different from this 400 to 450 phone Samsung is one of these companies that only does the satin slash matte finish on the backs of their most premium phones and so the squared off rails on the s23 ultra are a polished aluminum for contrast the a54 on the other hand is the other way around it's glossy glass on the back and it's a more Satin finish on the aluminum rails and I kind of like that too at the end of the day though they're literally both glass and aluminum and so really it comes down to two main differences between the two one is the size they only come in these sizes and so this a54 is definitively smaller and lighter than the ultra and two it's flat and that's totally fine where the ultra does have this little bit of a curve on the sides of the display but to be honest yeah build quality is very close here it is IP67 versus ip68 which by definition is almost the same thing and the a54 puts the SIM card slot plus a expandable storage at the top where the flagship just has a SIM card tray at the bottom with no expandable storage if I can safely assume that both Gorilla Glass 5 and Gorilla Glass vectus 2 both scratch at a level six with deeper grooves at a level seven I feel pretty comfortable saying that the a54 is 90 of the build quality of the flagship which is a really good start so then there's the displays now this is Samsung we're talking about here so they definitely go the extra mile with the flagship display no question about that it is ridiculously good incredibly bright super sharp responsive adaptive and efficient I mean every number on paper is pretty close to maxed out from the 1440p resolution to the 1750 nits of brightness from an AMOLED panel 120 hertz Max refresh rate but variable down to one Hertz with ltpo I mean it's pretty awesome so the a54 display is a step down on paper sure and when you actually use it you realize that they've cut out like the extra bells and whistles the over-the-top stuff that are maybe a little more for The Fringe situations but still keep the screen to a pretty premium level for 99 of use cases so like I said this only comes in one size so it's a little smaller in the flagship but that's also probably a good thing for some people because phones are huge so this is a 6.4 inch 1080p flat AMOLED this is still over 400 pixels per inch so even though it can't do Quad HD it's still going to be pretty great for most people that aren't pixel peeping like I am and it's still plenty bright I mean I'm looking at this thing it gets up to a thousand nits and regularly goes outdoors and looks totally fine like in the dashboard of my car and out in the sun no problems so in that way it's pretty close but you can also see the bezels all the way around are a little bit thicker this is one of those things that tends to get like pointed out in YouTube comments more than by people actually buying the phone but yeah it's true it does have slightly bigger bezels and a bigger chin it's not completely corner to corner and then while the s23 ultra has the ltpo that can adapt all the way from 120 hertz down to 1 Hertz when it's not moving this a54 display can adapt from 120 hertz down to 60 hertz and basically switch back and forth so not quite as adaptive and efficient but better than nothing and it goes pretty blue off axis more than some of the more premium Samsung panels already do and also that hole punch cut out as I pointed out before is not quite the little perfect black circle but it does have this little shiny metal ring that can be slightly distracting when the Sun hits it at just the right angle it's a small thing but I gotta mention it but yeah they still give you every single setting in here as the more expensive phone to dial in the display's colors and match what you're looking for so overall I'm willing to say the a54 has 80 of the display of the flagship it's obviously not going to match it on paper and in the most bleeding edge extreme situations like direct outdoor sunlight and things like that then you can see the difference but honestly most of the time when you're just using the phone especially indoors they look very similar which is pretty amazing just with slightly thicker bezels so then there's performance now this is where you start to get a little bit of a wider Gap here so you've already heard about the flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 8 gigs of RAM one terabyte of storage all that good stuff uh this is working with a lesser chipset here so it's it's just not going to be as good so the a54 is powered by an exynos 1380 chip which benchmarks about 50 to 80 percent lower than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in CPU it's it's a very comfortably mid-range chip I'll put it that way for context it's putting up similar geekbench scores to the a12 bionic which was in the iPhone 10s in 2018. so pair this with six gigs of RAM and you've got a phone that you know can handle everyday tasks but it isn't blowing anything out the water in terms of performance and the specs are only part of performance like when I when I say performance as a pillar obviously you want it to be able to open apps very quickly and be smooth and reliable so for normal daily things like checking email or social media scrolling or just subscribing to this YouTube channel like it feels just like the flagships because it's fine and it's also 120 hertz and it's smooth that stuff doesn't require a super high-end chip now sure there are few dropped frames here and there and it does feel a little bit different and if you gave me these two phones and didn't tell me which was which sooner or later I could tell you which one was a lower end chip but it would require me starting to push you know some higher end stuff starting to multitask starting to flip between a couple heavier apps at once opening and closing a few things when you get to like navigating while streaming music over bluetooth you know while reading something in a web browser on a big website stuff like that then the difference is actually really quite noticeable and then the s23 line all has these like Lightning Fast ultrasonic fingerprint sensors while the a54 does have an optical sensor which is just a bit slower and has to shine a light for a second instead of the ultrasonic ones which are more versatile you could also argue that built-in storage is going to be faster than expandable although some people just don't care like they just want expandable storage in which case that's actually a benefit for the a54 but yeah it's it's pretty clear that the performance difference between Flagship chipset and mid-ranger is pretty big it's noticeable it's a it's a feel thing it's a smoothness thing if you haven't used a more expensive phone you might not even notice but that's what it comes down to and especially with the higher end tasks these phones are running the same software one UI 5.1 but just one executes the same stuff a little more reliably and smoother so I'm going to give a54 60 of the performance of the flagship not bad so now cameras cameras cameras cameras we got all kinds of cameras typically cameras are what separate the good phones from the great phones and that's still true so you look at the back of the a54 and it looks just like all the rest of the s23 series obviously not as many cameras as the ultra but when you actually hear that this is the 50 megapixel main camera and this is the 12 megapixel Ultra wide and this is a 5 megapixel macro now you're starting to see where they saved money like in what world do you want a macro camera over a zoom camera this is the obvious version of like making it look like the more expensive phone but saving some money not putting a zoom but still having something there so now the actual photo and video taking experience is the same as the more expensive phones literally it's the same app the same UI the same features and buttons so that's fine we can all say what we want about Samsung's layouts but you know they work they're pretty straightforward and then the photos you get in good lighting they seem perfectly fine like if you don't compare it to something super expensive these are all super passable sharp detailed normal looking photos maybe a little bit blue with the white balance a little bit Overexposed but honestly short of the pixel 6A this is about as good as you'd expect from a 450 phone but of course like I said my goal is to compare it to the super expensive big brothers so when you do that highlights a little more some of the flaws of the a54's main camera which really is just that it tends to overexpose and take unnecessarily bright shots quite often and the white balance is a little inconsistent but it's funny there's always this angle always feels weird because most people buying this phone have never they have they haven't come from a 1200 phone they don't know what a 1200 phones capabilities would be so it's like comparing a Toyota Corolla to a Supra sure they come from the same company but like people buying the Corolla weren't cross shopping with a Supra and they weren't even thinking about getting a performance of a Supra so just me putting them side by side helps highlight the differences uh but yeah this camera's set is fine I think sometimes I boil the camera all the way down to like yeah this one's just fine but I really mean it it's fine like when you zoom in yeah you lose sharpness because you went with a macro over a telephoto so it doesn't come close to touching the zoom performance of the more expensive phone passed about four or five x the a54 also can't do 8K video or even 4K 60 like the flagship can but it can do everything else just fine and the ultra wide is pretty soft as expected especially in lower light but it happens to actually be a tiny bit wider than the flagship's ultra wide so it's got that going for it you know between the missing telephotos and the Lesser compute power this one can go in a bunch of different directions but I'll say the a54 is 70 of the camera for most normal photos of the flagship which is pretty good but then last but not least battery this one's pretty simple five thousand milliamp hours 5000 milliamp hours and so it turns out the usable daily battery life of these two phones is pretty similar but the thing about the chips though is the the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 which is in a lot of the higher end newer phones now is it's really good it's it's also it's both more powerful and more efficient uh than the XML so basically this flagship phone is capable of way more it's capable of a much higher Peak output and so you can actually Spike the usage a lot and like run down the battery pretty hard if you wanted to but then it's also more efficient so for you know combining it with this ltpo display just using it every day regular scrolling social media email hanging out you know this is It's Sip and Battery it's actually going slower through battery than the a54 so the a54 is more of a constant drain it doesn't Spike as high but it doesn't have as good standby time so the the curve of the flagship phone might look more like spiky but the a54 looks more like an even descent if that makes sense now you also do not get wireless char charging with the a54 despite the glass back that's one of those features that you sometimes see in phones at this price but it's definitely a common emission and the max charging rate is 25 watts which is straight up slow in 2023 but it's fine it's serviceable there are all kinds of phones offering blazing fast like 50 80 100 plus watt charging even at this lower price point so even if the battery isn't amazing you could at least top up quickly if you had that but that's not here either so it'll take about an hour to charge from zero to 100 totally average but overall it's it's not a substantial weakness especially versus the flagship from the same company which only does 45 Watts so a54 battery experience is is like 90 of the flagship so if you total up all of my assessments uh and average them out over 500 points you get 78 of the flagship for a third of the price which that seems like it's pretty clear that it's a pretty good deal now there's also of course lots of little things that didn't quite fit into those pillars like the slightly better haptics of the flagship for example you might be really into that or the bigger speakers that come from having a bigger phone that do sound better uh also there's a stylus in the big one uh also if you want decks you'd have to pay up because the a54 doesn't have that funny thing is they both have the exact same unboxing experience which is just the phone no charger but yeah these mid-rangers today masterfully mitigate the law of diminishing returns matching the flagship's Finesse for a fraction of the funds thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace [Music]"

desktops but also Epson watches accounting software and even anime all of that stuff is there and this is here and this raises a lot of questions like is it any good does it refuse to work when the

special in true Epson fashion it includes laser printing of course they're referring to the laser printing on the keycaps which includes not only Roman characters but also what I assume are Japanese ones I don't know I don't read Japanese what I do read is this fantastic label on the mouse which is the worst thing I've ever seen this is the sm9023 from light on that's the whole review which is fine because the main star of the show is the Epson Endeavor Pro which is kind of like saying Acer Aspire or Asus Rog given that they've been using this name so long so the specific model we're looking at is just on this little nondescript sticker right here the first thing that stands out to me about which is the rigidity of the chassis I don't think I've seen anything like this in the last 15 years sure it's not made of the you know latest trendy materials like aluminum but dang it this thing is built like a freaking tank that's not the only thing that reminds me of 15 years ago though check this out five and a quarter inch Bays not one but two and it gets even better a three and a half inch Bay are you kidding me it has a lock for the power switch this is how my parents kept me from gaming that's how they thought they kept me from gaming I actually had a cute everything about this design is so retro I wouldn't even expect to find USB 3 ports on the front of it and yet here we are okay I'm me oh what shut up it has an actual optical drive in it can't believe I paid real money for an optical drive in 2023. did we buy this oh yeah of course we did yeah oh good and we imported it but in Japan that might not seem that outlandish and there are a couple of reasons for this Japan made headlines recently for their efforts to finally phase out floppy disks in an effort to reduce bureaucratic waste so as a machine that can be used for business or a workstation for game development for example this could easily find its way into an office that still keeps a lot of data on disk or even worse diskette older home users with disk-based backups would also find it useful for the same reason and even for those without backups Optical drives may still have some alert as video rental stores are not uncommon there Geo a chain of video rental stores had nearly a thousand locations at the end of 2022 when you consider that one in five apartments in Tokyo are less than 200 square feet and the average house is less than half the size of its American counterpart it's not unreasonable to conclude that there are a lot of people who could have an entertainment center or a desktop PC but not both so with an optical drive in your PC even if you don't have an entertainment center you can still watch the latest Blockbuster videos you picked up on a two-day rental from the local Geo half expecting to find PS2 ports no not so much okay about as sophisticated as NCIX was in terms of branding of individual machines probably the most interesting thing back here is this he goes uh not much to write home about in terms of cable management there Epson that actually was our fault well that's our fault yeah yeah it was cable managed just fine did they wrap the CPU fan around this eight pin connector because in shipping if this gets jostled around it can pull out that connector so that's a bad idea the power supply is a 650 watt non-modular unit from Delta with a single 120 millimeter cooling fan the CPU is a ryzen 5600x but can be configured with up to a 5950x very high end case fan seems to use a bit of an unusual mount comes to us courtesy of manibia mitsumi fun fact mitsumi who later merged with manibia to create its current form was the company that made the controllers for the Ness the SNES and several others this fan appears to be a very similar 120 by 38 millimeter fan like you would find in many older Dell Optiplex units but with just the standard three pin power connector instead of Dell's non-standard 5 pin these thicker fans are great for applications where High static pressure is necessary like against radiators or restrictive fan grills not that this is a particularly restrictive drill what I want to take a closer look at here is our GPU and more importantly our GPU support bracket these were commonplace in Server Chassis back in the late 90s and early 2000s but have made their way out of fashion somehow in spite of the fact that gpus have gotten heavier and heavier as the years have gone by you'll still find these in Tier 1 systems or Puget systems for example manufactures their own out of laser cut acrylic but this is really robust I would actually be confident putting a modern heavy GPU in this thing knowing that it is not going to come loose in shipping this is great I guess we'll find out how well it works when we upgrade our GPU after because as you guys can see I didn't exactly go with a top spec gaming GPU out of the box don't touch I love the a the times it matters when it's spinning you won't be able to read it anyway and even if you could I suspect many people in Japan wouldn't read English like it should probably be in Japanese right I could be wrong this is a GT 1030 which is five years old and not a good GPU as we discussed in our surprisingly recent review of it but it's not the only GPU that the Endeavor Pro can be equipped with in fact it can be ordered with up to a 3080 TI 4500 workstation card for professional workloads but rather than pay a huge markup we figured we would just swap in a more powerful GPU on this side of the Pacific fun fact by the way epson's configurator is pretty rudimentary if you select a 3080 TI it won't automatically upgrade you to the 1000 watt power supply option a 650 watt unit should handle this card but I would strongly recommend the thousand watt unit if you want to be safer in the long run yeah what you're going to do well this how's this going to fit in there though because we're going to move these up and down oh wish me luck good luck to myself now that's weird last time I checked Epson also doesn't make motherboards how suspicious my first thought was they just put a sticker on there but that's not actually what happened it appears to have been silk screened on at the same Factory that did all the other printing on the motherboard I mean this is clearly an Asus Prime b550 plus motherboard but it's been rebranded for Epson curiously the model number has also been changed are they trying to make it harder to track down the original part number for some reason but then if they're doing that why go to the extra steps of rebranding it if they aren't also going to change the lettering on the chipset heatsink which still says Prime series on it hey pause the drive motherboard screws how about that we had so many requests for posit Drive bits for the LTT screwdriver presumably from people in Japan I guess can confirm Phillips head Works fine-ish maybe the answer lies with the Intel version of this Tower available in a stylish blue rather than red so you can show off your preferred processor brand is the motherboard from that an Asus Rebrand as well unfortunately we don't have that one on hand I didn't feel like paying another two thousand dollars plus shipping to get one oh that one's four thousand four thousand yep anyway what we did manage to do is track down a review of it that includes a plethora of pictures at pc.watch.impress.com.jp it's an X 299 chipset system with eight Ram slots a PCI connector and two PS2 ports on the i o it's also screen printed blue something that gigabyte might do but there's no x299 motherboard on the market that we can find that matches the shape IO and the inclusion of a legacy PCI slot to say nothing of the color so what the heck is going on here well if you've been building PCS for a while the model numbers on these motherboards might seem familiar not the numbers themselves but the font in the 2000s nearly every Asus motherboard featured this font slowly over the course of the late 2000s and early 2010s it was phased out of asus's retail boards this could be attributed to a corporate restructuring that Asus went through sometime in 2007-2008 the organization split with asus's branded offerings remaining with Asus while their divisions for OEM parts and case fabrication were spun off to a separate company called pegatron ironically pegatron would later end up buying ASRock which itself was also spun off from Asus but back in 2002 very inbred these Dell motherboards and these HP motherboards feature the pegatron font and are as far as we can tell made by pegatron it's probably not a stretch then to a assume that this case and any other parts not branded Epson are also pegatron if you're wondering whether Asus is aware that pegatron is rebranding their retail motherboard designs we emailed them to ask about how the devil all of that works and at the time of filming we were still awaiting a response though awaiting is a word that I'm using pretty Loosely here because I'm not expecting them to comment on it every time I've asked them about the history with ASRock for example they've just kind of gone let me get back to you and then never gotten back to me it's pretty safe to assume that they do know about all of this though given that they have drivers on their website for this model number albeit with very little additional information oh look at that she's level boys oh I like it laugh at the Antiquated approach all you want but that GPU is not flipping going anywhere and I don't even have the PCI screws in yet look at this I love it this is not a cheap chassis in spite of the fact that it kind of looks like crap and it's not painted black and doesn't have any RGB this is like solid never deviate from your principles here Epson this is awesome so level I could eat my dinner on the back of this 3080 TI cook at first too while we're in here I'm gonna upgrade it with some more memory we ordered the bare minimum eight gigs because I also didn't feel like paying their markup for system memory so let's go ahead and throw some more Ramen hey not bad huh it's not particular hey no I don't want that I don't know about these I no I want to use these these came with my gaming PC yeah you ever you ever tried to use a Japanese uh keyboard with uh with a US layout no oh my God the space bar is fragmented oh this Facebook no the spacebar is Tiny the rest of those are our keys for other things well I know I know I know I just mean it's in three pieces okay I have a short shift which I can tolerate I hate this enter that space bar though wow uh can I even yeah well no it's kind of yeah that's kind of where I would hit it most of the time no I should be okay okay just make sure that you change the keyboard layout I mean it's not quality that's for sure I mean it's possible but I shouldn't have been able to do that oh hold on yeah look at that we bent it back right I realized we never talked about the hot swap Drive phase in the front these are awesome each of them is just wired up individually to the motherboard so you don't need a complicated backplane or uh Port multiplier or anything like that you just load a drive onto one of these pop it in I wouldn't say that these were popular in the mid-2000s over here but they were certainly more broadly available and it was mostly due to cost that case manufacturers didn't Implement them where's my start menu at hello buddy uh is this their OS like did they load this on yes okay did they remove my bloody start menu or like no that's supposed to have a start menu it had a start menu when I left the other building okay cool yeah let's just give it the old the old one two here for a stupid gamery case it's not that bad it's kind of you know classy and I have some hope that that thick 120 mil fan is going to manage to remove the heat from this GPU there's an intake right next to the gpu's cooling fans that I think might help wait that's the boot hard drive yeah yeah we were trying to save costs this doesn't have a bloody SS oh my God you guys are doing the wag hoodie photo shoot hey there we go it booted up just fine this time also I am not having any trouble with this keyboard I will have you know yet where's my tildee you might also have some keys not line up with what they say on the keyboard if you haven't changed the keyboard over to Japanese layout no no I got this i got this I don't know it just says standard keyboard okay good luck bottom right corner beside the clock no no I'm good I got this you only have F1 hold on hold on this is the part we're missing oh give me one second oh we're missing something yeah oh we always put our Steam games on hey steam drive and there's a no type no front type c that didn't even occur to me yeah that's not the most modern thing oh balls to be clear this is a fairly small problem but a problem nonetheless it is 2023 and I just bought a computer with a mechanical boot Drive what yeah it's better than the craptastic ones that we got with the sports team branded mice like I mean I managed to do that I don't even know what the objective is right now oh this is just Team Deathmatch oh my God it's 15 to nothing right now this is not quiet it's that big back fan that chunky fan in the back is definitely contributing 71 degrees on the GPU though 63 degrees on the CPU while it's not the quietest system I've ever encountered it's not ridiculously loud either and the temps are well under control wow you could warm your hands on this maybe toast some marshmallows I mean with all the exhaust focused in one place and that's without even the highest end CPU that we could configure not that you can configure anything at the moment as of filming this unit was actually discontinued two days ago but that doesn't mean that Epson is done updating their desktop offerings it looks like they might be gearing up to revamp their AMD machines probably with ryzen 7000. we're going to have a link down below but please note they only ship domestically how much do they ship domestically well at least enough to justify a custom motherboard I guess and PC gaming in Japan has been going through a bit of a boom recently doubling in size in just four years by some accounts also our machine handled a high-end GPU like a champ even with that 650 watt power supply our 3080 made it through a stress test in our environmental chamber at 20 degrees Celsius room temperature with no notable thermal issues now that doesn't mean I'm necessarily recommending that you buy one of these the AMD version like this one starts at 226 000 Yen or roughly 1675 dollars with specs that are not great as for the Intel one it starts at 360 000 Yen or roughly 26.75 also not great but PC parts have typically been more expensive in Japan and Epson does offer on-site repair for very cheap like really cheap as low as 34 dollars a year for up to to six years you have to be within Japan's five most populated Islands but that covers ninety nine percent of the population just like 99 of our videos end in a Segway to our sponsor Squarespace it's 2023

      "corpus": "this is the xiaomi 13 Ultra it has the most sophisticated most ludicrously specked out camera system on any phone ever so I thought does it beat the most popular flagship phone on the planet the iPhone I mean it definitely wins a point in the unboxing Department not even because this is some sort of extraordinary presentation but because at least it does come with everything you need you get an insert on to off which has the Sim ejector a couple of manuals and a hard case this is kind of a weird shape and then right at the very bottom a 90 watt charger which is surprisingly compact for what's still quite a high wattage the USBC cable and then of course the 13 Ultra itself the iPhone packaging as you know is nice it's satisfying but basic there's no charger here and definitely no case it's not even really a competition and honestly the differences only get bigger when you start looking at the design of these phones the iPhone is much less polarizing it kind of has to be if Apple wants this to be the phone that 30 million people are going to buy they've got no room to be edgy with any of the style choices they've got to keep it simple clean elegant and this does that xiaomi doesn't have that same concern I think this company knows full well that they won't be selling 30 million units of these they're going to sell two maybe three million and those three million are going to be Pro users who are actively seeking something that feels unique and this achieves that goal I wouldn't say it's the neatest prettiest phone it's got like a speed bump halfway up the back of it besides the phone blend into the rear which is again just a bit weird and it kind of makes this strip going up the back look like a carpet that's not fitted properly the phone rattles quite a bit thanks to lots of large camera lenses moving around and the screen borders are still not completely even all the way rounds which at this point is just bordering on painful but technically it's really impressive the only reason that you can even see the sides blending into the back is that the sides and the back are actually all one continuous piece here which you know I've had a pretty good play at trying to bend or Creak or crack and uh nothing by using a unibody design like this they've massively reduced the number of points of vulnerability around the phone it reminds me of how reassuring the unibody MacBook feels is like how resistant it is to any kind of flexing compared to a lot of these even technically more expensive laptops that just are made of more parts well that did not sound good and then this uh rug on top is actually specially treated silicon which is made for grip is completely resistant to smudges and fingerprints made to be anti-yellowing which is not a given for silicone finishes and even inhibits the growth of 99 of bacteria plus I know I bang on about this but having your camera in the middle of your phone's body is actually just really helpful because it means that when you put it on a table it's quite usable without wobble so effectively I think the iPhone is a little more form I think the xiaomi is a little more function both matter but I just think it's up to you and this case on which one matters more but then you notice something on the xiaomi that is just undeniably Peak smartphone the screen because putting aside for a minute my nitpicky gripes about the bottom chin being thicker or the top corner is looking a little bit off just because of the way the screen slopes around the edges the panel itself is dazzling you might have heard of a few phones in the last few years cropping up with 1500 nit Peak brightness levels the iPhone's actually well regarded for going even beyond that at 2 000 nits and now this pushes that all the way to 2600. that's so high that it's a difference you don't even notice in most scenarios but it means that should you be in direct sunlight this phone is not just visible from all angles but actually bright from all angles plus the fact that it is slightly curved at the sides is I think a perk too it feels a little bit rough when you have the pre-installed screen protector on because your thumb is effectively grazing over the edge of it but as long as you possess the risk appetite to take it off it makes gestures feel way more fluid than they do on the sharp edges of the iPhone and the crown jewel is that while both phones have super fast 120 hertz refresh rates the xiaomi's using more up-to-date refresh rate Tech that can scale the refresh rate up and down faster and more battery efficiently than the iPhone cam it is also the higher resolution screen but I just hesitate to call that a benefit because it's one of those strange situations where they're giving you the option to use the screen in super high res mode but then subtly telling you that they don't actually recommend it for the majority of users for battery reasons because by default the phone actually runs at 1080p which is lower than the resolution on the iPhone okay so given the xiaomi takes this super energy saving ideology and the fact that you've got this super energy efficient panel how good actually is the 13 ultra's battery so I've got a new version of both phones I've charged them up to 100 we'll unplug and I'll spare you the pain of actually having to watch smartphones die one percentage point at a time let's just fast forward all the way to the moment where the xiaomi calls it quits because sure enough yes even though it has a 5 000 milliamp hour battery which is quite significantly bigger than Apple's 4 3001 even with the low resolution and the more advanced screen technology it is still the first one to go it ends up with 10 hours and 8 minutes in this particular run and the iPhone only very marginally longer at 10 hours 18. as for where that puts these phones in Real World usage I'm using a 14 pro Max every single day since launch and I would say it's one of those phones with good battery life but not so good that you can just completely forget about it and xiaomi sits in that same ballpark but what makes me actually slightly prefer it is the new hibernation mode see plot twist the xiaomi's not actually dead it's programmed to hibernate when it hits one percentage point of battery it closes all apps it disables almost everything to give you one more solid hour of still being reachable so overall we'll call Battery a draw but that's a cool feature can we just have every phone do that from now on and if you're curious how long each one then takes to charge it up well I plugged both back in I went down to make myself an iced tea and by the time I was back which was probably four minutes later xiaomi was already at 15 it's not hugely surprising I mean 90 watt charging is significantly more powerful than Apple's 27 Watts but it is kind of interesting that even though this is xiaomi's highest end smartphone ever it's far from their fastest charging phone you can get xiaomi phones with over 200 watts of charging power nowadays that charge in like nine minutes but I guess because super fast charging comes of its own set of compromises like usually having a smaller battery capacity and that their marketing for this one is almost definitely going to focus on the cameras they decided to keep the charging a little bit more typical which is not to say slow because it's still fully charged within 45 minutes while the iPhone is lingering at 66 xiaomi is way ahead of Apple but uh we're not yet I think it'd be absolutely hilarious if me and my tiny team of seven people could actually overtake the single largest tech company on the entire platform and hey if we do I will personally build the largest most powerful iPhone on the planet myself so a sub to the channel would be me tiorik so that's five points to two points right now but what about the audio quality I actually have a very exciting new microphone that we're going to be able to test this with so for a moment try to imagine that these are your ears this is what the iPhone sounds like it's very clean sound with a little kicker bass but it's not one of those phones at the same time that like defies its dimensions in audio or anything so now let's switch over to the xiaomi and this phone does something a little differently instead of one downward firing speaker and then the earpiece on the front doubling as the second this has one bottom firing and then one top firing and I like the fact that xiaomi gives you more symmetrical sound but to be honest for me the fact that Apple's earpiece fires directly towards you makes the vocals feel more direct and it's also a little bit louder so I'll go with the iPhone here the software is subjective of course but I will say one thing xiaomi is not xiaoming shying away from being clearly inspired by Apple you know it's similar when you're finding that the muscle memory that you've developed with your iPhone still works to control this phone now that doesn't make it bad I mean on the contrary this new MIUI 14 can let you open up more apps at once although who actually uses more than two on a phone as a wider selection of more colorful widgets I'm finding it better organized in terms of finding what you need from the settings plus this is the smoothest a xiaomi phone has ever been in my eyes and actually just before we get to the cameras this is something that we do need to test how fast is it a few weeks ago I compared the speed of the iPhone to a super top gaming Android which had an external cooler attached to it but arguably the even more interesting question is how does a more traditional Android Flagship one that's more focused on photography stack up to Apple in performance so I've run a whole Suite of benchmarks and the results are pretty clear that apple is far ahead when it comes to the CPU performance anywhere from 15 to 25 depending on how you measure it but xiaomi leads when it comes to the graphics and just to see how well each phone handles temperature because xiaomi does go on about how this phone has the first Aerospace grade toroidal Vapor liquid separated powered cooling system called the marketing these days kill me now I ran an extreme stress test for 20 minutes straight and actually yeah you'll notice that xiaomi not just starts at a higher score because its Graphics are better but also that this score Falls slower over the course of the test it has a higher stability of 80.8 percent as opposed to 65.8 which basically means that whatever gobbledygook they've actually called this internal cooling system it does work when you push both phones to their limits this does feel hotter on the outside but that's because the cooling system is doing a better job of getting heat out the inside and internal heat is generally where more of the problems occur which makes overall performance about a draw depending on what specifically you're trying to do on your phone time to see what this phone was made for cameras because I mean you don't have to look at the specs for long to see that on paper xiaomi absolutely murders the iPhone which talking a 32 megapixel selfie camera four 50 megapixel cameras on the rear yes four with all four having high-end sensors and the main camera having the largest sensor currently available on a phone this is why the crowd basically erupted when the price of this phone was announced we've never seen a phone camera like this but uh before we get to the rear cameras which to be honest actually do deliver on that type we need to talk about the front camera because it does not it just looks so washed out I actually look a bit like a ghost and it's a far cry from what phones like the Google pixel have done with their super deep natural skin tones and while this is somewhat rescued by the powerful image processing when you're snapping photos honestly the video is pretty trash I mean look at this room over here it's just it's just a white look plus it's limited to 1080p which I just don't understand like genuinely if there's anyone that showing me watching this video please tell me why this phone your 2023 Pinnacle Flagship Ultra phone cannot record 4k on its front camera it's not a tech limitation phone's been able to do this for years now surely it's not a cost concern they've kitted out every single other camera on the phone all the way to 8K and it can't be anything to do with the size of the cameras either because Samsung does 4K just fine with one that actually takes up less space the only thing I can think is like maybe people feel like 4K might over represent skin imperfections but honestly how your skin looks as much more down to the software processing than it is the resolution you can have sharp footage that also makes you look good like the Samsung that I'm recording this on it might seem like a small nitpicky thing but honestly in an age where everyone is creating content using their smartphones especially this front-facing camera I don't think it is this front camera has probably been the single thing that has actually stopped me from jumping ship all the way from the iPhone because I've very tempted and to understand why I've been so tempted let's talk about the rear cameras and really the best way to Showcase just how great these rear cameras are is not to bind you with a flurry of hundreds of shots taken from it I mean every Flagship from the last five years has been able to take photos like this it's showing you how easy it makes it to do that the key thing that I would say xiaomi have just mastered with this phone is the thoughtlessness everything about the way this camera system works the fact that each individual lens is super high quality and so you can zoom all the way in and all the way out without worrying about degradation the fact that focusing is first class so you don't need to sit there messing with it or even tapping your screen to pick out your subject the fact that colors are really pleasing I hesitate to say that the colors are accurate because to be honest if you're going for raw accuracy I still think the iPhone does do a better job but for me personally what the xiaomi does do is better than that I think if you point blank ask someone would you rather your photos are realistic or not the vast majority of people would say I want realism we don't like the idea that images are being tampered with and I'm the same I like the concept but the truth is every smartphone is doing thousands of calculations and adjustments to each photo you take anyways and when it actually comes down to it and you show someone what technical accuracy actually looks like side by side with what the xiaomi does which I would say is stylistically prettier I have a strong feeling that most people would rather actually have xiaomi's photo it delivers not necessarily exactly what your eyes see but more what your eyes think a great photo should look like and so it makes you feel good it makes you excited to use it to see what other beautiful cinematic artsy shots you can take while also for one of the first times matching the reliability of the more functional tool iPhone camera now it does also have a variable aperture on its main camera which allows it to switch between a wide F 1.9 and a really narrow F 4.0 but I just think it's kind of dumb for this phone I mean the three main challenges that we spent the entire last decade trying to overcome with smartphone cameras are getting more light into these smaller sensors shooting shots faster and creating more background blur to mimic the Cinematic style of professional cameras switching your aperture to F 4.0 basically shuts off your light into each shoots shot slower and reduces background blur I mean there's a couple of super Niche situations where you might want this like long exposure photography but come on when your front camera looks like this fix that first anyways whereas actually even more impressed by this phone was it's night mode Let's be very clear the iPhone is good at night but the xiaomi 13 Ultra feels not like it's kind of close could go either way genuinely like there is no competition like this is a photo from both phones main cameras you can see so many little Parts where the 13 Ultra is just picking up a little bit more information or is a little bit sharper but where you notice the difference even more is flicking to the ultra wide cameras kashami is both wider while also being more detailed I was expecting xiaomi to also steamroll when it came to the zoom shots since Apple's zoom camera is just not equipped for the dark so it uses its main camera and just digital Zooms in I mean to be fair so long as there are lights around the xiaomi does tend to win but it's just when you go to those super super dark scenarios that Apple's artificial intelligence algorithm does seem to just creep out ahead a little bit and xiaomi freaks out but the video really impressed me I wouldn't go as far as to say that this has better video than the iPhone but it's not really worse the sharpness the stability the dynamic range this feels like a big thing to say but for all the time that I've used this it hasn't felt like a compromised video experience which is one of those things that I've just come to expect when using an Android phone it's still a little bit grainier in super low light but then on the other hand you can film 8K video at five times magnification yeah it's only 24 FPS so it's a little jittery or cinematic but that's not normal on a phone so xiaomi definitely wins in more categories than the iPhone it doesn't outright mean it's a better phone for everyone like to me the front camera is particularly important and I can't work with this but it is enough for me to say that if you like the sound of it I can very easily recommend it when it launches in your country okay this will be cool actually try filming this on the zoom camera of the phone so recently I've gone into a bit of a rabbit hole when it comes to securing my accounts I've been seeing how even YouTubers who followed all the recommended steps they've still managed to get hacked it's scary and it's made me realize that there are entire forums out there on the dark web whose entire purpose is basically just for people to buy and sell user data your addresses your passwords and sometimes they don't even need your passwords a hacker can just send you a link via email and if you so much just click on that link can download a file that gives them access to your session ID which effectively just means they can start browsing the internet already logged in as if they were you so using surfsharkvpn it's not a one-click solution that instantly solves all internet security problems but it does make it a lot harder for Bad actors like this to mess with you it serves as basically a middleman to receive your internet traffic and scramble it to keep you Anonymous to whoever's hosting the network plus it comes with a proper antivirus a private ad-free internet search and surfshark alert which will let you know if your data has been compromised it's a very simple quite inexpensive way to strengthen your security using the code boss it ends up as less than three dollars a month with an extra three months for free for unlimited

      "corpus": "foreign this is the town of Saint Thomas Nevada or Nevada as they say here around the turn of the century St Thomas was a bustling agricultural Town it was a farming town and people lived here this was actually the school the elementary school where the kids went every day every day kids would run down these stairs to go home and play with their toys or probably do chores it is a farming Community also it's raining here today so hat but by 1940 this entire town was under 60 feet of water because about 10 miles that way is Hoover Dam and this was once Lake Mead now as we all know Lake Mead has retracted quite a bit over the years of going through something of a mega drought right now so sometime in the 1990s St Thomas um was out of the water again and what's left here is mostly just a bunch of Foundations but this was basically about 50 years underwater and the fact of the matter is St Thomas is just one of dozens hundreds even of sunken towns and Villages all around the world that were created because of reservoirs being built sometimes the Levee broke sometimes it was a catastrophe sometimes they got their land butt out from them but they're all over the place and most of them are actually still underwater So today we're going to look at the history and some of the coolest and most interesting sunken towns in the world [Music] there's a great quote from the movie Inherit the Wind where the character Henry Drummond says quote progress has never been a bargain you have to pay for it progress isn't free it's from Team America that whole thing yeah for most of us progress is this inevitable unyielding force that moves a Breakneck speed and you're just trying to keep up with it basically I mean just look at all the AI news lately we also generally believe that progress is a good thing and on the whole it is I mean we like to complain about the modern world a lot but if you think about it we live lives of luxury that the richest kings 500 years ago couldn't have even imagined but all that progress has externalities and unintended consequences like take the interstate highway system here in the U.S yes it may cross country travel a lot easier and faster and it was actually funded as a National Defense measure in the 1950s but it also killed a lot of small towns you know small towns that you used to have to drive through on small you know Farm to Market roads and whatnot maybe stop and get a sandwich or patronize a business and now you just bypass completely I kind of grew up in one of those towns but a lot of small towns had it way worse earlier in the 20th century there was a kind of a massive leap in progress that led to a lot of towns going underwater and I don't mean that financially I mean literally underwater North America is covered with artificial Lakes those Lake bottoms used to be ground ground that had a long history maybe people used to travel there maybe people Farm there maybe people lived there maybe a lot of people live there it's a really weird thought when you realize that for a lot of lakes there are Towns at the bottom of them think about that the next time you're on a jazz game so how did this happen well in the early 20th century there was a mass migration of people from rural to urban areas as industrialization led to new jobs and higher wages in the cities between 1800 and 1920 the percentage of the population that lived in cities went from 30 to 50 percent all those new people needed clean water and all those factories needed power so what follow was an explosion of new artificial lakes and reservoirs and hydropower stations all over the country for example here in Dallas the population doubled from 1910 to 1920s so the city bought land around White Rock Creek to build a reservoir the dam was finished in 1914 and it began to fill up with water creating what is today White Rock Lake although this used to be Farmland today is the largest urban park in the country it's twice the size of Central Park no Towns at the bottom of it though the same can't be said for many lakes in Tennessee starting in the 1930s the Tennessee Valley Authority was created to build dams and power stations along the Tennessee River and while yes it provided power and improved the economy and modernize the entire region it also displaced 125 000 people and destroyed several towns it also saved George Clooney at the end of O Brother Where Art Thou another standout area was New York state where the Catskill Aqueduct was built between 1917 and 1924. it created six reservoirs to provide water for New York City but this required drowning 25 communities if that sounds Bittersweet that's ironic because one of the towns was actually called bittersweet even more ironic one of the towns was called Neversink now to be clear these communities weren't just drowned with no warning or recompense they were acquired by imminent domain and people were paid for their land but still sometimes towns are lost to progress it happens a lot and sometimes nature decides it needs to slap a bit that's exactly what happened to Port Royal Jamaica Port Royal has a crazy history actually it was an important hub for transatlantic trade everything from sugarcane to Rum textiles cotton and of course Slaves by the late 1600s it was one of the largest European cities in the new world second only to Boston but it was also riddled with pirates yeah like the whole Pirates of the Caribbean thing this is where all those pirates hung out and with them came all the booze and prostitutes and debauchery one would expect it was once called quote the most wicked and sinful city in the world a title that now belongs to of course Provo Utah it was so associated with pirates that the famous pirate Captain Henry Morgan became the city's lieutenant governor in 1675. yeah that Captain Morgan but the party was short-lived because on the morning of June 7 1692 a massive 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the island Port Royal was largely built over sand which experienced instant liquefaction buildings roads and people were literally swallowed up by the ground geysers erupted structures collapsed and then a tsunami hit the city that basically watched anything that hadn't already been destroyed out to sea by the time it ended around 33 Acres of the city had just disappeared underwater four of the five forts were demolished and 2 000 people were killed one detail that I ran across it's a pretty gruesome is that apparently all that liquefaction in the ground caused the bodies in the cemetery to come to the surface and then the tsunami washed those out to sea to mingle with all the newly dead Port Royal still exists today but most of the original cities Under 12 meters of water one of the more interesting sunken towns is the ancient city of shachin and China means lion City in Chinese because the city is populated by dozens of lion statues and this place is old it was founded in 621 A.D during the Tang Dynasty and actually became kind of a major administrative Hub in the XI Jin Province but in 1959 as China began modernizing their infrastructure hydroelectric dam was built creating the chandau lake chandel lake grew to cover 573 square kilometers leaving many of the hilltops above water and which actually created thousands of islands it's actually a pretty neat landscape but in the process it displaced more than 300 000 people and flooded several towns and communities much like the Tennessee Valley Authority but way bigger which begs the question is there a Chinese remake of O Brother Where Art Thou because I want to say that cheen was a prominent in ancient city and now it's gone and that's sad but there is a silver lining because it was flooded before the area industrialized so it actually kind of is Frozen in time it's it's preserved in water much the way it was a thousand years ago you just need scuba gear to see it in fact some have taken to calling at the Chinese Atlantis in that same general hemisphere of the world as calyazen Russia this is another town that was drowned by a man-made lake with a slight difference that we'll get to here in a second kanyazim was settled on the high Bank of the Volga River and was separated into by another small river called the jobna the town's population grew over the years eventually sporting a couple of churches the monastery of Saint Nicholas or the Nicholson Cathedral on One bank and The Trinity College and Monastery on the other bank but in the 1920s say it with me several Hydro power plants were built one of which created the ugly Reservoir which drowned half the town and just like that all those houses and Gardens and streets storefronts all that stuff went to a watery grave except for one thing the bell tower of the nikolski cathedral it was just tall enough so that half of the bell tower remained above water creating a really interesting View later on this Tower would be used as a navigation point in a lighthouse and I think I read that they still do Services there sometimes makes the baptisms pretty easy I guess by the way it's not the only submerged tower in the world there's a whole page on Atlas obscura of submerged towers around the world including in Italy Spain and Venezuela but perhaps the oldest underwater city is pelva Petri Greece now you might be thinking you know hold on a second that Chinese city was built in 620 A.D surely this isn't older than that well it is older than that and don't call me Shirley Pavlo Petri was completely lost at time until it was discovered on a peloponnese peninsula in 1967 and it was mapped the following year and it's believed to have been inhabited as far back as 3000 BCE it's like 5 000 years ago this was a Bronze Age City and some researchers consider it Neolithic An Origin based on some of the items that they found there nobody knows for sure what happened to this city to make it slip into the drink but theories include earthquakes rising sea levels erosion and a tsunami and of course the Tennessee Valley Authority really using digital technology archaeologists discovered buildings Courtyards streets tombs and religious structures many of which suggest they were Mycenaean society as Elias spondylus the head of Greece's underwater Antiquities Department said quote it is significant because as a submerged site it was never reoccupied as such it represents a frozen moment of the past so yeah kind of like xiachen the fact that this town was submerged actually preserved it and offers a unique glimpse into the past at this once important city or maybe it was a Port Royal of its day who knows by the way this city um predates Plato's story about Atlantis just saying now this is by no means an exhaustive list there are hundreds of sunken towns and communities around the world and yeah as bigger and bigger dams start to be constructed more and more towns will continue to disappear I mean the three gorgeous Dam in China drowned 13 cities 140 towns 1300 Villages and displaced up to 1.3 million people but it also generates around 100 terawatts per year without using a fossil fuels so its merits are hotly debated the point is as we continue to decarbonize our electrical grids into the future we might be seeing more of these dams being built sacrificing even more towns and Villages plus as more people move into the cities those cities will need more water spurring more reservoirs that drown more towns and then those people will move into the cities which will need more water it's a vicious cycle add-on type of that rising sea levels and more extreme weather events due to climate change and we might be entering a new golden age of sunken towns different golden age is the right word no that's very vague and unspecific but there is one very specific weather event that researchers are keeping an eye on one that might spell Doom for a lot of towns in California okay so take a look at this picture this is K Street in Sacramento in early 1862. that year California was hit with a massive flood that came to be known as the great flood of 1862. it started as a snowstorm in the Sierras that turned into the biggest flood in modern U.S history California saw one third of all property destroyed 800 000 cattle drown and four thousand people died towns in the Sierras were the first hit as the rivers overflowed their Banks and as the flood traveled into the valley several towns disappeared overnight with entire communities drowned almost instantly after several weeks of rain Sacramento to the San Joaquin Valley were completely underwater that's 483 kilometers by 32 kilometers wide flooded up to nine meters deep all this water affected places as far away as Arizona Nevada Oregon New Mexico even Utah and Idaho all places there right now are dealing with a mega drought turns out they also get mega floods and fairly often according to the U.S Geological Survey Mega floods hit California about once every 200 years on average and the last one was in 1862. who's doing the math sedimentary analysis suggests that this pattern is repeated for at least 2 000 years and these are corroborated by Native American legends in the area of course this didn't happen every 200 years some periods were longer than others so maybe the real takeaway here is that it could happen anytime maybe I shouldn't smile when I say that so as we were writing this episode California's been dealing with massive flooding and insane snowstorms that have affected up to 15 million people and actually caused a handful of deaths it's being blamed on atmospheric Rivers which is an awesome term and this is exactly what it sounds like a massive flow of moisture in the atmosphere that condenses and Falls as rain as this graphic shows the Earth has a kind of belt of warm equatorial air masses that are saturated with water vapor from the war motion below this belt is always traveling toward the east from our perspective thanks to the Earth's rotation this is called the Coriolis effect but from time to time this swirling mass of air can fling a little piece of itself off to the North or South creating these long tendril structures filled with water that's the atmospheric River and when it hits the land and cools it condenses and falls to the ground as floods the ones that hit California tend to break off and come from the direction of Hawaii so they're actually called a Pineapple Express that sounds like a joke but it's not that's what they call it but from time to time all this chaos will line up just right and filling a particularly massive chunk of itself toward California and that's how you get these Mega floods but the biggest of these Mega floods was in 1605. historical evidence suggests that the 1605 flood was at least 50 bigger than any of the other Mega floods including the 1862 one it's thought that this flood basically just made a lake out of the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys that lasted more than a decade this is the Doomsday scenario that keeps climate scientists up at night it's not a massive earthquake that could knock California into the sea it's this this is a storm that has actually happened before and variations of it have happened regularly for at least 2000 years it is almost certain that this is going to happen again in the U.S Geological Survey already has a name for this storm they call it arcstorm AR stands for atmospheric River and the K stands for 1000 because the storm could bring one in one thousand year floods to some places it's believed that this future flood could cause up to one trillion dollars in damage with a death toll in the tens of thousands the scenario includes overwhelming flight in the Central Valley Orange County Los Angeles County San Diego the San Francisco Bay area and other Coastal communities wind speeds in some places could reach up to 201 kilometers per hour and hundreds of landslides could damage roads highways and homes major Metro areas like Los Angeles Sacramento and San Diego could find themselves partly or completely underwater it's not total Doom and Gloom though there are some things we can do to prepare for it a recent study published in science advances in 2022 talked about some of the options it's Daniel Swann one of the researchers involved in this study told CNN quote I think the extent of Mega flood losses can be significantly reduced by doing certain sorts of things to revamp our flood management and our water management systems and our disaster preparedness that same study also pointed out that yes I know we're all tired of hearing about this but yes climate change does play a part in this warmer temperatures means warmer Waters means more water vapor in the equatorial belt which creates larger atmospheric Rivers by the way this doesn't just happen in California these atmospheric Rivers occur all around the world so yeah between the needs of Modern Life and the effects of Modern Life we may be losing a lot of towns and communities in the coming years which is sad but going back to St Thomas the town that I visited at the beginning of this video apparently the last person to leave the town was a guy named Hugh Lord who literally waited until his home was halfway underwater before putting all of his stuff in a canoe and Rowing away from its house in every one of these towns have a story like that I'm sure people people don't want to leave their homes people don't want to have to change so maybe the lesson in all this is that we're going to have to be more flexible in the future be more willing to adapt that's what got us this far one thing you can easily change is your shaving habits like getting rid of those plastic cartridge blades for a Precision safety razor from Hinson shaving okay look at this you see what they did here look at this they performed an experiment just to prove that their razors are better on the skin than the cartridge ones so you've heard me talk about Henson they're cheaper they're cooler they're more sustainable yada yada that's all great but the best part is they're nerds their design was based on the idea that if you fully supported blade all the way across you could cut down on chatter which is the blade skipping across the surface of the skin and because they work with Aerospace grade equipment they can make the design incredibly precise so they did and they've been getting rave reviews for it but that was not enough they teamed up with a company called Mimosa Diagnostics to use their special thermal camera to measure the differences in blood flow to the skin after using their razor and a leading cartridge Blade the more damage is caused to the skin the more blood flow that same damage leads to razor burn which the medical term is erythema and they did this with multiple people and you can see how it's redder on some people's faces than others it's redder with the cartridge razors then with the hens and razors and they determined that quote statistically significant Improvement in post-shave arrhythmia was observed when using the Henson razor and you can see it right there in those photos it's crazy I mean just the fact that these guys went to this much effort to check their own Works enough reason to give them a shot this is really cool so um it's better it saves you money over time it's less plastic and it's even better for your face so head over to hansonshaving.com and give one a try grab a box of 100 blades while you're at it and enter the code Joe Scott at checkout and you'll get those blades for free you literally won't spend another dime on shaving for like a year at least it helps support this channel helps support an awesome company and you'll get a better shave I mean what more do you need uh hensonshaving.com links down below all right today's the day everybody this is the big reveal of the champion of the sketch Madness Tournament I want to thank everybody who voted in this this is a lot more fun than I expected um but uh we all kind of know what the answer is to this like I've been doing Blind reveals of this this whole time but I think we all know the answer but the that's the final match up was the big million subscriber clone sketch and the one where I had Earth and Venus in Family Therapy uh there was uh one person whose name I have not uh gotten the uh approval to reveal just yet there was one person that got them all right and wins the grand prize uh we're gonna be doing some live events at some point in the coming year and and this person will get to have a VIP access to it so congratulations um three people got 14 right eight people got 13 right and on down you can see it on screen uh but the big reveal the champion is is the Clone sketch of course with 60 to 40 percent that was actually a little closer than I thought it'd be um but uh yeah that I I did not get very many right in the brackets but I did suspect that this one was going to win so I'll Pat myself in the back for that one just a little bit but um I don't know this tells me you guys want some more clone sketches that's the lesson that I took from this so um it might happen again soon and so yeah I mentioned a minute ago that there was one person who got all the questions right that is our grand prize winner I didn't know how many people would do it but it was just one and that person was Olivia Corey so congratulations Olivia um we do have some live events that we're working on and when we get those going we'll let you know and you're gonna have some VIP access to it along with all the other prizes that everybody else gets to get for those who won the lower tier prizes which there were quite a bit of you um we'll be emailing you and taking care of that as well in the next hopefully a couple of weeks but again this was a lot of fun I do really appreciate all of you who voted all of the people who were able to get some prizes from this and there's actually quite a few of you uh you'll be getting emails from us soon because we've got your emails in in the setup for this that's how we get to deliver those prizes to you so uh again I want to thank everybody for participating in it this was a lot of fun for me maybe we can do another one again at some point but uh there you go thanks a lot everybody all right last but not least big thanks to the patreon supporters who are supporting this channel directly and forming an awesome Community I cannot thank you guys enough for

      "name": "Hacksmith Industries",
      "corpus": "This is our most powerful Iron Man project ever!  A 1.5kilowatt fiber laser! Is that actually possible? How would you even go about creating a highly complex mobile laser and cutter, and welder, and make it sick  and stylish like an Iron Man tech? There is no way I've made something that does all that...or did I? With this new laser tech we are now one step closer to the real life Tony Stark. To this day, the most powerful, self-contained laser that we can fit into an Iron Man gauntlet, it is still this 100 watt blue laser that we used in our Iron Man repulsor. At 100 watts this thing is already terrifying, But I want more power! Just ten years ago, a 1000 watt laser would have cost you upwards of a quarter million dollars if you could even get your hands on one. Nowadays, you can get a one and a half thousand watt fiber laser shipped to your door for just about $6,000. Let's just say we have our fair share of lasers, Giant industrial fiber laser cutter, MoPa laser engraver, laser resin 3D printer a CO2 laser, a new creality laser cutter, fiber laser welder, laser etching machine, and a miniature CO2 laser. That's ridiculous. Our industrial laser cutter that you've seen us use in almost all of our projects use a 1500 watt infrared laser similar to this. This thing is big, heavy and fragile, and it requires over 10,000 watts of input power, as well as a mini fridge sized water chiller to keep itself cool. But it is capable of cutting through half inch thick steel like butter. Unfortunately, there's no way I'm getting all of this mounted on my back. But lasers like this come with a nice glass fiber optic cable to transmit the power. Which means if we had the right lenses, we could mount all of that onto my gauntlet and still use it from pretty far away. The initial plan was to use a cutting head from a fiber laser machine. But as you can tell this thing on an Iron Man gauntlet, it would be a little oversize. But then we got our hands on this laser welder, which is way more compact and simpler to use. And in addition to welding, this can also cut through steel and remove rust. To do the welding and the rust removal the laser actually moves back and forth using a tiny mirror on a galvanometer to actually point a laser in different direction. But if this thing\u2019s on my hand I can just point the laser with my hand, which means I can actually remove this entire part. And since I've designed a custom fancier nozzle, we actually don't need that either. So we're left with a simpler water cooled culminating lens and our focusing lens. So I needed to create a piece to join the two together at the right distance and with perfect alignment. After a bit of prototyping, I came up with a design that we can manufacture in aluminum on our Tormach 1100 CNC machine. And this is our final piece which actually sits right in between the culminating lens and the focusing lens. Keep them in perfect alignment. This is the smallest one and a half thousand watt fiber optics lens assembly I've ever seen. And this is going to be perfect for our Iron Man laser gauntlet! The build of the gauntlet consists of 66 pieces that bend and weld together into five assemblies. Before we start making the entire gauntlet. We have to figure out the order of operations. We know we want to laser cut the pieces. We want to laser paint them...wait.  Laser painting?  When you get a piece of stainless hot enough it forms a layer of oxide. And based on the thickness of the oxide, we actually reflect different colors. This right here is our OmTech Mopa laser. And basically what it can do is super precisely adjust the power, duration, speed and frequency of our laser pulses to accurately control the temperature of the stainless, giving us any thickness of oxide we want, which means whatever color we want. And we want to laser weld them. But the problem is the laser engraver they're going to use to paint our pieces doesn't really do great with non flat objects. So I want to run a test and I want to figure out what surface finish and what order of operations is going to give us the cleanest color and the least amount of scratches after we're done bending all these pieces. So we finish the entire thing. It doesn't have a huge amount of scratches and it looks really clean and really consistent. So we have the painted, then bent, bent and painted, sandblasted, painted, then bent and sandblasted bent and then painted. And I think out of the four, the one that looks the neatest is actually the very first one we did, which was painted and then bent. So these three don't make the cut and I think this is our winner. The tig welder was needed in the early stages of connecting these thin metal pieces and getting each piece aligned. But from there on, it was full steam ahead on the laser welder. In true Stark Industries fashion, we're using lasers for everything. We are inside the laser cutter. It doesn't seem like much right now. Once I'm done with, it\u2019s gonna be pretty cool. It's incredible how simple laser welding is. To do a weld like this requires tons of training for TIG welding. But this laser welder, it's like a hot glue gun.

I got to go get my gloves, my glasses. Uhh. This bucket is a terrible freaking work table. Everything moves. Where the heck are my damn nozzles? Why? Why? Our previous gauntlets looked straight out of Iron Man. But to put them on and use them was so uncomfortable. With this revision I changed that by sewing in a Kevlar glove that holds both the chainmail glove and the air cup together. So theoretically, it\u2019ll all be one piece and be super easy to slide my hand in Give it some air and I'll hold onto my hand nice and tight. You know, this is not going according to plan. With the shape of this being so, like, wavy. The problem is laser engraver they're going to use to paint our pieces doesn't really do great with non flat objects. Gloves also not coming together as well as I'd hope so. Obviously in order to join all the pieces we've had to weld and grind some areas where the surface is like very inconsistent. It's very hard to get it perfectly flat and to focus on the same spot. Yeah, it's the issue of doing curved surface because the focus is really important with the color. Physically, I'd say this looks way better than last ones. It was a cool try. Like the laser works great for painting flat things. Painted properly I think this will look really legitimate. So other things. So these fingers. Same thing with even a way it did weld. It would just like have pieces of wire sticking in and it was just like, can you even get your finger in there? No. Even my broken finger has more, more flex. Yeah, that's my other finger. Why don't we get a really small stainless steel flathead screw? And that way you can push it through the chain mail through one of the links. And then I could stick through the slot or change those. So it's a hole. And then that way, really, you just need to tack weld, that screw in place. And it\u2019ll hold everything there.  It's weird. Like this is our third one and this one has not gotten easier. Linus spent almost two weeks of this time painting all of these individual pieces. He\u2019s going to be very upset when I tell them I'm going to get rid of this entire finish. What do we say when we fall down? It\u2019s a Bruce Wayne...an Alfred quote something about getting back up. It's pretty logical. Are you going to tell Linus? Yes.  I think we\u2019re going to take a break with the laser painting.. I mean, we're going to sandblast this whole thing and then we'll get rid of this finish and then just go with traditional paint. I know. You put a lot of heart into this. I understand. It does look messed up. The quote was, Why do we fall? so we can learn to pick ourselves up again. Why do we fall Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves up. Some rope in here Why is there rope in there? That's what I was using. to hold the finger open. Oh, that's why you couldn't fit your finger in it Bogdan. We ruined everything. No, no. Did you sprinkle Kevlar in my Red Bull? So what do you think Bogdan? Like, 50 bucks? That's like $8. Not even like $5. But it\u2019s a collectible. It\u2019s a one of a kind. $100. Less than the mini saber. $35. $700 someone can make of themselves $500. $40. That's more reasonable. 40,000. Ah we\u2019ll just let Jose figure it out. After hours of adjustments connecting the fingers, painting and setting up the electronics. Which by the way, you can view the full schematic diagram using the maker.io link below. We finally finished the laser gauntlet. I'm nervous. We\u2019ve got a little bit of a leak. You can see there's one of the hoses a little loose, but it's not too major right now. So I think this will work for this test. This is the most powerful Ironman laser we've ever built, and I cannot wait to see what it can do. Let's get straight into it. That was so fast! We're moving onto a mannequin head! Lasers on! Meet your maker! There is a hole straight through that mannequin head. Look at that. We saw what this can do to one mannequin head. But what if you're fighting an entire army? You can see the beam! That was awesome! The amount of heat that came off that helmet with all this oxygen Ridiculous! So compared to the previous lasers we've done, it takes a little bit longer to get going because it's an infrared laser. But as soon as the material becomes a little bit charred, the whole thing just melts instantly. How do you feel about Mike? Well, it's a little scary. That thing's got a lot of power. You saw the range that it fired at. I mean, he went right through all three foam heads, and it started burning the door like ten feet behind it. The thing's scary. It's awesome. Logan thoughts? This thing...it's a little scary, Darryl. That laser is kind of like the bad boy you should be worried about. You know, be worried about or be inspired to be Here's the right way to light a candle using a Hacksmith mini saber. Easy. But I don't think it's overkill enough. You guys are finding like the weirdest stuff for me to burn. But I guess this is how you de-pit an avocado. precision. I should have picked it before it started raining. And now it's now it's not lighting. And, you know, like, I got this. It's okay. It's. I'm sure I got this. I'm sorry, man. Our Hacksmith shop coats are fire resistant, But are they laser resistant? They are not laser resistant. What about some of our other Hacksmith products like our safety glasses or a stone paper notebook? Oops, that's why I'm wearing these. Honestly, this thing is scary, but if you need to protect yourself against Iron Man, it's might be a good choice. Light them up Not as good as my TIG skills, but that is a solid weld. I think we're through. Oh, yeah, we're through. Okay, you order some rust removal. We got that perfectly clean piece of metal. No more rust. We've got a variety of items that we stole from our coworkers. To help test stuff. set up on a couple of different sizes of rope and metal chain. Let's see what it can do. Next up, we've got some metal chain and metal cables! And that was with a long distance lens. So now we have the short focus lens and the high pressure oxygen nozzle to be able to cut through metal. Let's do this. Nice. No problem. Look at that. Look how well that cuts Thicker metal cable. This thing is sweet! I just lit a metal cable on fire. The thickest metal chain we have. Perfect. We managed to cut everything from two millimeter rope all the way to one inch thick rope. And even 3/16 inch steel chain. This is a metal door that I am going to cut through. Look, this is literally cutting straight through that door. The doors in on fire on the inside. This literally feels like Iron Man. look at that. That's just a piece of spaceship. We cut through a 1/16th thin steel door. Well, what about 1/8 inch steel plate? There's molten steel flying everywhere. Holy crap. This is basically like the lightsaber all over again. Except this time I'm Iron Man. I just got a piece of metal in my mouth That is 1/8th inch steel plate. I mean, look at that. That's so hot. This thing can burn. This thing can engrave this thing can cut through steel. And there you have it, a 1500 watt Iron Man laser gauntlet. If you like this video, please make sure to leave a light comment and subscribe.

IR shot so I guess picture mood and menu so this is the view on window the stop side here there's a tripod holder also non-slip stent there is a white bird right there there it's pretty far I don't know how many feet away that is let's turn it on easy to show you guys is the preparing okay the zoom zoom aside here super easy there's a fence there's another fence well that's far there's a fence close by and then there's a bigger zoom over there there you go also I can look with two eyes like regularly it's nice and comfortable and this might Zoom one and two so I could just go two with couple of fingers keep adjusting it and it will zoom in really nicely this is what it's going to look like with just this adjustment this is focus this is zoom and then Focus so that's awesome and then the digital Zoom right here zoom in more like this then it goes the more and then Focus it's quite nice let's go on maximum oh wow that's easy actually too close wow so we'll be awesome if it's on a tie pad too kind of harder to do it filming it and focusing it beautiful there you go okay it's complete darkness sounds like a forest but when we look into the camera I just focused it so that's quite nice there's a fence without it it's complete pitch dark with this night vision it's nice yeah the focus is just amazing [Music] I'll just leave look like an animal that's cool yeah that's pretty awesome okay again complete darkness and that's what I can see into this night vision it's amazing nothing on this I cannot see it with anything even without the Cardinal it's super dark but with the night vision so much to see 12 color flame candles blue red purple yellow pink and green let's see how they work okay beautiful comes with the stents and yep I'm gonna do one of each grab it by the bottom so they don't break there's a green purple okay turn off the lights okay let's slide them all up see how they burn in semi.com pretty easy light just like pergola Kennels okay and this is what they look like the blue is really blue red is red green looks a little while yellow is very yellow and pink nice purple it's a long lasting candles seems to be it's burning quite nice and long walking test is burning quite nice a little bit darker area wow that looks so nice even better right here forgot to turn off the light they go and they don't blow out easily that green looks soil again too I like it so long lasting okay blowout test nice and easy too mechanical hose faucet timer that is cool so it has 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 105 121 year mono or no so it's like I know person this way then turn it this way boom and then whenever it goes to zero pay attention to this little lever it will lock itself okay it's on zero turn it on okay a little bit one two but looks like it stopped uh lock it all the way okay I don't see any leaks great okay let's say I wanna press it and time it it's running and let's adjust and I guess the time I would die here okay looks like it's stopping oh cool when the type timer stops is slowly lock locks it up it's still clicking sweet so it is self-stopping and but no it's at zero that is awesome so if I wanna press this to get more water perfect kind of nice I don't need water anymore lock it hard medium soft beautiful let's see how it looks cold water still cold just set it onto the burner I don't have to boil water first then add the egg in for like 7 10 12 minutes it will automatically uh warms up and will let us know when it's soft medium or hard let's see how it works but let's turn off soft medium line coming up turn it back on we'll wait till it's a little bit more medium soft okay it indicates it's on hard almost very hard this couple lines okay let's see if it's hard boil oh yes hard boil perfect not overcooked it's just nice whenever a Decatur disappears it will be even harder but I think this is a hard boil all the way the way I like it and when it cools off it goes back to normal and ready to be used again this is the quick connect with the lock looks like everything made out of plastic but there's a on and off obviously this would be lined with the pipe floor would be on this would be off and the pipes looks this way okay Quick Connect push this way and it locks in boom then this twist a little bit and it will not push back and then twist this way just a little push and it will unlock so it's easier to pull it off and it has a swivel so that would be easy to adjust it it's on off and on so now we don't have to spin it all the time okay now Quick Connect part boom very easy to plug it in very easy to unplug it with one hand actually don't even have to push it up it just slides in so well now on and we got the hoser onion full of water don't see any leaks really nice I can folding chair very skinny so the way to unfolded just cover that here and right here and push it down okay this way there you go when it sits on it I'm six seven I'm very comfortable look at that swing quite nice there is the front legs so that way it doesn't fall forward too much okay once I'm done I'm ready to fold it pull on these two then what I learned is the best thing to do is uh I'm gonna push this down once these two goes in it's easy to fold that's the easiest way to fold it for me then it goes into the holster and Holster will hold it all together and once again don't fold it [Applause] there you go very nice Makita brushes below kit really powerful there is uh the attachment one two three so we can go on a longer stumble a little so probably we'll need the longest and then there's two more to get it closer to the um ground or powder from the ground then the butter is closer here two 18 volt batteries so 36 volt then there is a speeds from one two six okay go back to one then there is a Tigger this is speed one then press and lock left hand and here full body so will be a good test let's blow some locks with full power I have a little bit of gravel right here we need to blow it off because it's not good for the concrete [Applause] [Music] [Applause] very good okay now there's some dirt Spilled Out right here [Applause] no [Applause] so very powerful to removing some of the dirt for the leaves it will work really well too"

And new eye-popping views of Earth from space \u2026 A few of the stories to tell you about,  This Week at NASA! On April 28, NASA astronaut Steve Bowen and United Arab Emirates astronaut Sultan Alneyadi did work outside the International Space Station to prepare for the installation of more new solar arrays to augment the station\u2019s power system. Four of the upgraded arrays have been installed already. The remaining two will be installed on a future spacewalk.  On April 25, Vice President Kamala Harris, Republic of Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol, NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, and others visited our Goddard Space Flight Center. They were briefed on our space exploration efforts, as well as missions addressing climate change, like TEMPO,  which is similar to Korea\u2019s GEMS. Both missions are revolutionizing the way we observe air quality from space. These recently released views of Earth in ultra-high definition, or 4K, might just be the next best thing for those of us who may never make it to space. The imagery was captured from the space station between March 2022 and March 2023. Check it out for yourself at go.nasa.gov/earth4k. For the first time since 2019, there  was in-person competition at our Human Exploration Rover Challenge. The event was an opportunity for student-built, human-powered rovers to be tested on a course that simulates the terrain of the Moon, Mars, and other distant bodies. That\u2019s what\u2019s up this week @NASA. For more on these and other stories, follow us on the web at nasa.gov/twan."

      "corpus": "Do you know what this is? If you do, you're going to be, like, super excited about this video if you don't know what this is. Let me bring you up to speed. This is called a Prince Rupert's Drop, and it's created by dripping molten glass down into water. Now, when that happens, this really interesting material science thing happens where the outside is an extremely high compressive stress. But the inside of this drop is in extremely high tensile stress. What that means is you can hit the tip here with a hammer and it won't break. It's glass, but it doesn't break. You can even hit it with a bullet. And I've done that here on this channel and it shatters the bullet. But if you even nick the tail, it explodes. I get really excited when I do this. It explodes. Watch this. I now have a mess I have to clean up. So a prince. Oh, wow. It's everywhere. That little moment where it explodes. I wanted to capture that. And so what I did is I cast a Prince Rupert's drop in epoxy resin, and then I shattered it, and I tried to capture the exact millisecond of the explosion. Now, a lot of people watch this video and they're like, Oh, well, you did it wrong. You didn't use the right epoxy, you didn't vacuum off the gases correctly. And these are fair questions. I mean, look, it's yellowing. It's not as great as I wanted it to be. But there was one person that saw this and asked a very different question, and that was Cal Breed, the man who made the original Prince Rupert's drop that I showed here on Smarter every day. Cal's question was, should you be using epoxy at all? Couldn't you do it with glass? To which I replied, What? What? Think about it. A Prince Rupert's drop is glass. Putting glass inside molten glass has to change things, right? It's a very difficult problem. So today on Smarter Every Day. We're going to get into the mind of an artist who understands the material properties of glass far more than any engineer I know. And we're going to see if we can put a Prince Rupert's drop in molten glass and shatter it. Let's go get smarter every day This is Cal. He's the owner here at Orbix Hot Glass. What we're going to do today is we're going to have fun. And I have fun by making weird stuff. And I've got a great team of awesome people that like making weird stuff with me. We've made clear Prince Rupert drops, I want the ice blue one, and so we're going to pick up some ice blue glass. We buy colored glasses, and then we can break off a chunk of it, put it in here, heat it up to a thousand degrees. This is, we park it in the garage. So this is our garage. It's hot enough to keep the glass from cracking, but it's not hot enough that it's going to slump. We're going to pick that up on the end of a rod here in a minute. Heat it up, pre-heat it a little bit more up in that top corner. What do you mean, Up in there? Yeah, up in the top left corner there, that's going to be the hotter area. Yeah. And then we'll bring it out and put it into here, which is closer to 2000 degrees. This is what we use when we're making anything throughout the process of just reheating. You can't just make it in one gather and it's done. We're going to heat up that blue, make it into little pieces so that we have multiple tries because the colored glass for some reason doesn't want to be made into Prince Rupert drops. The clear ones we can do in a small bucket. They can hit the bottom and they're fine. But with the colored ones, if they hit the bottom, they typically break. Jill, for some reason has a knack. We figured out that she, she has a higher percentage right now. Do you have the magic touch for the color drops? -I guess so, yes. What's the secret? What? I'm not. I'm not sure. She's just lucky. -You just know what's up. I'm just able to do it somehow. Yeah, I have a higher percentage rate of success. That's, that's awesome Okay, you see what's happening here? We are already learning that these artists have a feel for glass in a way that an engineer doesn't. Like, they understand it in a more intimate way. You heard Jill there, who's an apprentice under Cal, talking about how she's able to do certain things and she can't really articulate it. She just feels it. She knows what she's doing. So when I think of this, this is just clear glass. When I see this, this is colored glass. They didn't make this, by the way, They make way prettier stuff. So I just see clear glass colored glass. But these artists see like temperatures and gooieness at certain temperatures. And they have an intimate level understanding of how this stuff works, which is fascinating. So today we are going to be working with Jill, who you met there. We've got Eric, Lily and Bodi. These are people who are all working under Cal, which means they're learning just like Cal did. Cal has apprenticed all over the country under some of the huge names in the glassblowing world. It's cool to see how this knowledge is passed down through exploration. And Cal explains here what he and his wife Kristi were thinking when they started the studio. When we built the shop, we wanted to make sure it was like a mad scientist kind of place. So you come up with ideas and let's try to make it. Similar to what we're doing today. It's a process of learning how to explore, how to learn, and then you have your ideas and you come in here and try it. All right. We now know that glass behaves differently depending on what color it is. So I asked Cal to explain some of these colors. Yeah. So this is ah like an ice blue. You can see how beautiful that blue is. These are very dense bars of colored glass. So if you were to use emerald, it's so dense, it almost looks black. Right. -Okay. Which is why I chose this ice blue. I love this color anyhow, but it's more transparent. A little later I explored these colors more with Eric, who explained that the physical properties and the color itself is not only a function of the chemicals inside the glass, but how you heat it and cool it. Copper Ruby, this is a very interesting color. This will go completely clear when you're working on it. Completely. And then once you put it in the oven, it will turn blood red. And if you get it too hot, sometimes it'll just go clear. It's a very bizarre color. I've never heard some of these words. -Aubergine. It's like a purple. Uranium is, Oh, no way -Out, of Is it actual uranium? -Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So to make the individual Prince Rupert's drops, they need to break up that one piece of blue glass they had been warming up in the garage. And to do that, they attach a thin, solid metal rod using already molten glass as glue on the tip. That grabs the blue piece. And then they put that in the glory hole, they heat it up even further, making it malleable. Then they form individual balls that they can break off in a really interesting way. So you just broke that off with a mechanical vibration. Every time we're making a piece, we have to eventually get it off the blow pipe or off the punty rod. So we're going to create a a weakness, you know, that we can shock typically with temperature. And so umm putting a little bit of water on it or a cold tool in that weakness. -So and then tapping it, break it off -So he's making the weakness now. He's yeah, well he's kind of creating a narrow spot to make a good weakness. Yeah. -A stress concentration. So engineers and scientists, they think about materials a certain way, right? They've got aluminum and steel. And if you pull and push these things, they have certain things called a stress strain diagram. Steel, you're going to pull it and it'll eventually it'll yield and then break. Aluminum does the same thing, but it does it a little bit differently. Glass is different. It doesn't yield and stretch over time. It breaks because it's brittle. Glass artists are always thinking about that point right there, the point at which glass breaks. Sometimes they're trying to avoid that, like in the middle of a big piece. And sometimes they're trying to create that. There's more to this, though, because they're going from liquid glass to solid glass. You've seen a graph like this before, right? This is the phase diagram for water. We can boil water from liquid and turn it into a gas. We can freeze water and turn it into ice. Right? We can move into the solid part of the graph. This is the way I always understood matter to work. You can just move around on this graph changed from solid, liquid, gas based on the pressures and temperatures. Well, yeah, that's true for water, but that's not true for all materials. Water has what's called a first order transition. Let's make a graph of viscosity versus temperature. If you have solid ice and you heat it up to turn it into liquid water, that phase transition happens very quickly in an extremely small temperature band. This is why water is called a first order transition. Glass, however, is a second order transition, which means the phase change happens gradually over a wide temperature band. And you would think the graph of that would look like this: linear, but it doesn't. It works like this: cold, solid glass exists up here in the glassy region. But as you heat it up, the glass transition begins and you fall off and the viscosity starts to change drastically, then suddenly it levels off in a rubbery state. This is known as the rubbery plateau. More heat is added and you drop off the rubbery plateau and it starts to flow in what's called the rubbery flow region. If you add yet more heat, the glass will start to flow like a liquid. Look at this curve. Glass Artists know how to use this curve to make glass do exactly what they want. If you were a glass artist, where would you want to work the glass? For me, it would be on the rubbery plateau. It's a relatively large temperature range that gives me the same physical properties. That's pretty cool, right? So as a glass artist takes their work out of the furnace, it's a certain temperature, right? And then it starts to cool off. And so they have a certain amount of time to work it until it gets all the way back over to the glass transition region. And then they can't work it anymore and they have to stick it back in the furnace and they move it back down the rubbery plateau, and then they come back and forth and that's what they're doing. They're controlling the viscosity by managing the temperature of the glass. They don't need to know these graphs to know what they're doing. They know it in their soul. Like engineers, we're thinking about the stress strain curves and we're like, Oh, the glass is going to break here. Well, the glass artist is managing all this with the temperature of the material itself. So they're riding up and down the curves at all times and they're just doing it. So what I want you to think about is this curve, because this is how I have to understand it. The first step for the team is to make the Prince Rupert's drops. Did it work? Oh, wow. Yeah. -That's a beauty. Oh, that is so beautiful. -Yup. So now we have this beautiful Prince Rupert's drop. How do we get this thing in molten glass? The obvious answer is we need it to be transparent. Whatever we're going to hold the glass in. So it needs to be a glass. And so Cal has explained to me that he can't just go get a glass off the shelf and pour molten glass into it because the temperature difference will cause it to explode due to thermal stresses. So what Cal has elected to do is create this glass as he's getting everything else ready. So it's going to be hot and the temperatures are similar and it's going to work out beautifully. And just the process of how he makes this is amazing. So what we're about to do, you can't do unless you have multiple artists doing different parts of the process. Is that true? Yeah. You have to have a team for this. There's no way you could do this by yourself. Everyone really has a great understanding of the material already, so this is only helping us learn the material better. I think we should just try it. -Okay. Sounds good. So the first step of making a drinking glass is to gather glass in the liquid flow region onto a blow pipe. Cal then takes it out of the furnace, gets the blow pipe cool where he can hold it. And then he does this. What?! Did you see that? Back that up. Cal puts a little bit of air inside the glass and then he plugs up the end of the pipe with his finger and then the heat from the glass makes the gases expand and it does all the work for him. He used the ideal gas law to blow up the glass. That's amazing. -Just going to gather one more time over it blow, please good. stop. So at this point, they have a sphere of glass and now they're going to straighten the edges and make it a cylinder and they're going to flatten the end. Watch how they do this. And you're thinking about temperature and thickness and things like that right now. -All of it. Yeah. Stop. Okay, Eric, feel heat from here down and we'll drop it out a little bit. So he's only going to heat it shallow. That way we can, ah, stretch it from from the shoulder. We've made a kind of a wide shoulder. We're going to stretch it down now. So once again, the heat differential is plays part of how you shape it. Okay, So see how we had this colder shoulder. I was able to brace the tips of these off of and had her blow it up and it blew the glass here. You made it a cylinder. -Yeah. So now he's going to heat it even shallower. So he's making it upside down. Right? And so this part's cold and this part's hot. So this part is already solid. So he can take his tongs and he can put them on down there and he can push down and form the part that's hotter. So they're in different parts of the flow regime on that curve, which is amazing. Also, he's rotating the thing because this part that's over here that's more droopy wants to droop down. This is incredible. So he's going to heat only the base now so we can flatten and tighten that up. -Okay After that more shallow heating. The end of it is more pliable so they can flatten it out. They do a combination of paddling and using the gases inside to make it fill out. After that, they then put another rod on the other side and they break off the cup, turn it around, and then they make the cylinder from the inside out. All the while, while we're doing this Lily's over there putting some molten glass on a piece of kiln shelf. So when we set the glass down, the kiln shelf won't be too cold and thermally shock the glass and break it. Can I briefly look at it. -Yes. Oh yeah. Yeah, that's awesome. Okay, now that the cup is finished, Cal started letting everybody know where they need to be when because he has to manage the temperatures and the timing. He has a big ladle that he's going to get molten glass in and it's very dangerous. I got out of the way and went and got the high speed camera ready and I just sat back to watch. Okay, I think we're ready. Are you all ready? Yeah. -Ready. Oh, dude. I'll tell you when, Jill. I'll tell you when. -Holy moly. Now. yeah, yeah, yeah, ya'll. We got to be a little faster on that big time. I want. I want to be able to lay that down and be able to pick this up and you be and shove it in there and boom. I was still making my way back over. I mean, the glass is still, like, super gooey. Like, you could still put it in there, you know? Other than that, Look, look, you did the cut perfect. Look, it's like flat in there. Looks like a cup of water, you know, like. -Yeah, Yeah So let's look at the slo-mo and see what happened. You can see when he triggered the tail of the Prince Rupert's drop, it ran straight to the molten glass and then did not go any further. Let's ask Jill what happened. What is it that you need to do quicker? I didn't quite catch it. So the the the snapping of the tail has to be done faster because the tail is so skinny. Once Eric shoved the Rupert's drop into the molten glass, they heated up so quickly that it like slumped over. So Cal has to snap it before that tail heats up. All right. It's getting complicated. Hang with me here. If you think about where the Prince Rupert's drop is on our curve, it's way up here. It's solid, right? It's cold, but it's not a lot of mass there. If you think about the molten glass, there's a whole lot of it, and it's really hot. So if you think about when the heat transfer starts, that molten glass is going to influence the Prince Rupert's drop a whole lot more than it's going to influence the molten glass, which means the Prince Rupert's drop is going to run down that curve down into the rubbery plateau. It's going to melt quickly, right? So there's a time thing we have to think about here. It has to do with heat capacity and the amount of time it takes one thing to heat up versus the other. And the colors that we're doing, blues and greens are on the softer side of of colors. So those tend to heat even quicker than, say, like a red or something like that. So having learned the lesson, Cal and his team made another cup and got ready for another go. And now. Whoa, so you use cold water to do it. -Yeah Okay, things are happening and Bodi, you get your shot. Take your time. Take your time. That's still dripping, please. There you go. Jill. Okay, that was pretty. Look at that bubble coming up. Where'd the bubble come from? -I guess we must have trapped an air bubble. It'll probably come to the top, We can pop it with a torch. That should semi disappear. Nice. -Mhmm, Cool. Are you happy with that? -Yeah. Yeah. You know, I'd be great if I was, like, a master caster and I would not trap air around For some reason we didn't catch all those on other ones. Well those are like when the glass is, like, folding in there like that. It's like, it's trapping air. This time the fracture ran down into the glass and we could see it on high speed. We tried it again with the deep blue one, and just like Jill was talking about blue being softer, it didn't work. It didn't rupture and go down into the molten glass. So we had a failure on our hands. And at that point, Cal did something interesting. He had always talked about wanting a square one, so he put it on a punty and put it back in the glory hole. There we go. Focus more on the back because it's colder there. Oh, you're making your square. Yeah. -You're making your square. I never thought about doing it this way. This would be a little bit less grinding. Okay. And it really got weird, didn't it? That looks awesome. Yeah. Typically, if I screw up, I want to screw up as many ways as I can in one go. Hmm, We'll see. I think it can be done substantially better. But this is a start. So you learn on the mess ups too, don't you? Yeah, that's what I was saying. Like, if we're going to mess up let's mess up as much as possible so we can figure out as much as possible. So is that why you started squishing it? Yeah. Like this is the one to squish. Let's go. Got it. So we did it one more time, and it's cool to see how the teamwork got better. The choreography of all the elements got smoother and tighter. And so much more calm. Okay. I'm ready, Eric. Push it in there, good. Good. Yeah. That was awesome. Okay. Cal, what's happening? I don't know, that one blew all over my face. Blew in my face too -Keep watching it because it'll heal up. The last one they did, it looks like a little cloud and the cloud goes away. Really? Do you think that's glass flowing in there? What do you think is happening? No, I think just the heat is healing it, you know, It's It's just slowly closing up, isn't it? Yeah. I don't think it'll heal any further. I think the rest of it is just a veil of air bubbles, you know? Let's watch that again at 41,000 frames per second. I love the lighting on it too. Whoa That's awesome. That's fun. So you remember that Cal wanted to make a square one? Well, Cal told me that sometimes glass artists will use graphite to make molds. so I bought some modular pieces of graphite and started trying to put it together and then took it to Cal, who adapted it to his needs and figured out a really clever way of using it so he didn't have to make a glass cup every time. Yeah, cut it, please. We need to practice the cutting. Not quite molten enough. No. I'm still going to pop it. Ya'll watch your eyes. Oh, we didn't close the mold. Cut it. Remember the shears move Hold on, one second one second See if we can maybe get in whatever. Okay. Yup push it in there. And That looked good. Yeah, it definitely worked in there. Okay, Dude, Totally going to admit. I did not think you could do that. Dude, that looks amazing. So when we pulled these out of the molds, you could see that the inside is still very, very hot and the outside is cold. This ends up creating stress inside the glass. And glass artists have a way of dealing with this. It's called an annealer. Basically, it's an oven that gradually heats up and cools down the glass to relieve the internal stresses in the pieces. Now that the mold was working, the team could work even faster and they can figure out what worked and what didn't. Okay, that looks. Yeah, I think we got something -Absolutely awesome. Yeah, I think we got it. Yeah. -You like it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was good that time. That one before that is still pretty rad. That looks so cool. That looks awesome. Sweet. I love it. Yeah. It's good. I think. I think you got it. Yeah. Boom. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. Good teamwork right? There ended up being a ton of failures, but a select few were chosen by Cal after they came out of the annealer to be worked in the cold shop. The cold shop is where Cal uses an assortment of tools to cut, grind and polish his art pieces to their final form. The cold shop is all about patience. He uses a variety of grit and diamond tools like this lapidary wheel to make flat surfaces. He uses an interesting wobbling tool called a reciprolap to passively polish surfaces using silicon carbide grit. He also uses this diamond wheel to fine tune surfaces and shape them to exactly how he wants. Glass is an amazing material. There are trade offs for how you make a piece. When something is blown. The surface finish is perfect immediately, but when it's cast, sometimes you see what Cal calls the elephant skin on the outside, which Cal often spends hours and hours smoothing. A quick flick of the wrist or nip with a tool in the hot shop can easily translate to dozens of hours of work in the cold shop, where Cal carefully refines every surface of the art piece until it catches the light just right. Revealing the final piece as he imagined it. 11 years ago, I wrote an email to a guy named Cal Breed. I was an engineer and he's an artist. And the engineer needed a little thing called a Prince Rupert's drop. I think it's fitting that my deepest understanding of this topic came when I went back to the guy that created it and tried to get into the mind of the creator and see what he did and how he was thinking. And once I did that, I started to understand this material at a much deeper level than I initially even hoped to understand things. And so now I would like to show you the piece of art that Cal made out of this. I think it's beautiful. It's like the bottom is folded on there. I think it's pretty, man. I mean, I think you're able to see really like the folds of the glass and then those skins piled upon each other as it was pushed in. But the fact that it shattered. It shattered, but it's you know, it doesn't have much room to go. The glass has got such a thickness to it. Right? It's like this weird moment of fracture than reassembly. Yeah. -I don't know, man. It just makes me feel things. I just don't know what they are or what it makes me feel. It's like a weird science, art, mechanics, materials. -Right? These things ended up being gorgeous. I can see now what Cal was drawn to when he was imagining this before I could imagine it. We also looked at them under the polariscope. This reveals the stresses inside the glass and you could see the folds as the glass was ladled in. And you could also see how the nose of the Prince Rupert's drop pushed aside that. And it ended up like in this amazing rainbow pattern, this is almost my favorite part. It looks like a it looks like something in space, but it's got supersonic shock waves coming off of it like it looks, I don't know. That's how my engineer brain interprets this. There's two main things I learned in this video. The first thing was about the second order phase transition of glass. I didn't know that. And it's fascinating. And the second thing was about failure. Now, sometimes people will celebrate failure and there's a place for that. But Cal has a unique perspective. When he's doing something really, really hard. The moment of failure means something different to Cal, and it was informative to me. A great piece is basically balanced right on the edge of failure and success. It's just it's just balanced right there. But you don't really know how or where that line is. So you're very excited about that idea, it's spectacular to you. And you go and do it even though you don't seem like it. You're going into it with a little bit of fear and trepidation to get too close to that line because you don't want to fail and lose it. But once you do fail it... all that's gone. Now it's game on. It's all about just learning, right? So if it's a piece that you know is going to take four and a half hours and at 3 hours, it's kind of screwed up. And you just say, okay, let's stop and start over. Well, you really don't know what happens in hour 3 to 5. You have no idea. So when you get to three again. Now, you have no idea what's coming. So my idea is usually if I screw up, screw it up all the way that I can to find out exactly what's hiding, what my intuition doesn't, what vocabulary of intuition has not been developed, what part of that language. So now I've screwed it up, screwed it up, screwed it up all the way until the finish. We know where things might happen. So now, when I go back into it, I've got the intuition more developed. I mean, failure ends up being a good space for discovery, right? But it's like, if I'm going to fail, let's, let's keep failing, let's keep screwing up. Let's see what see what's there. Let's go find out. You know, like, but if you just stop and put it away and start over, you're kind of missing out on a lot. The fact that Cal and the team were able to figure out how to make a blue Prince Rupert's drop and how to cast it without melting it, I think that's amazing. So if you actually want this thing, I've asked Cal if he'd be willing to sell it. He said, absolutely not. I can understand why. Because he loves it and I love it too. It's special to me. But I just asked him to put it up on his website, priced not to sell. This is one of the most fascinating objects I've ever seen in my entire life. It's this blend of fine arts and science and research and learning, and I just love to stare at it. I've had it for a few days, and if you'd like to buy it, you can do so at calbreed.com You see, he signed it there. I think it's I just think it's amazing. So if you're interested in this, go check out calbreed.com So it will be interesting to see what price he chooses. He also has other ones that he's going to put up there as well, some clear ones. And they have this ghost, I don't know how to describe it like a veil. It's beautiful. So if you'd like to check that out. calbreed.com And he also has figured out a way to cut some polarizing filters and to send those as well, which I think is really cool and that makes it look neat. I'm going to close with this 11 year old email I wrote to Cal. I said I would love the opportunity just to work on your crew for an afternoon or something. I would like to tell people about your website and where you're at so they can contact you to commission your work. I don't make anything from telling you to go to calbreed.com or orbixhotglass.com This is just me trying to make good on an 11 year old offer I made to a buddy and I think it's awesome. And thank you to the patrons for allowing me to make videos like this. If you want to support smarter every day, you can do that at patreon.com/smartereveryday. That's it. I hope you enjoyed this. Go check out Cal's website calbreed.com It's absolutely phenomenal. This thing is beautiful. If you want to see maybe he has a few more he can he can make and put on his website. That's it.

      "corpus": " More charcoal needs to be made for smelting experiments  Digging a pit for charcoal   Lining pit with clay  Conical pit is 50 cm wide and 25 cm deep  A rim is made around the edge to stop dirt falling into the charcoal and contaminating it  Time lapse of making fire  Drying the pit with fire  Drying wet wood with fire in preparation for making charcoal  2 thin sticks laid down as foundation  Alternating layers of wood stacked on top   Each layer is perpendicular to the one below  Fire is lit from the top of the heap and burns down  Water is collected to douse the coals when carbonized  The fire burns back down the heap against the draft converting the wood to charcoal without burning it up  Wood is stacked against the pile to stop logs rolling off  When the fire has reached the bottom, the sticks are pushed in causing the coals to fall into the pit  Unburnt wood is stoked to the top to further burn in air and convert to charcoal. Coals at the bottom of the pit remain unburnt  The coals are then doused with just enough water to extinguish them. The whole process took an hour.  The residual heat dries the charcoal  The charcoal is passed over a woven sieve. Lumps over 2.5 cm roll into the pot while lumps smaller than this fall on the ground.  The larger grade of charcoal is used for smelting and forging because air is more easily blown through the larger void space in this fuel bed giving a higher temperature.  The smaller grade charcoal is used to supplement fire wood in ordinary fires  This centipede came out of the wood/small charcoal pile. Be careful handling wood and charcoal piles as venomous creatures make their homes here.  Now it lives in the roof with the scorpions  Charcoal pit  Wood left over for the next method  A small stable pile of wood is laid down first  Then small pieces are laid against this at an angle so they won't fall over  As the pile grows, larger pieces are added  Take time to neatly stack the wood so there are few spaces  When the mound is the desired size (50 cm tall, 50 cm wide here) fill any gaps with smaller pieces of wood  Collect mud and bring it to the mound  Coat the mound in layers of mud starting at ground level and going up, but leave it open at the top so smoke can exit  Make air holes about 25 cm apart (6 holes are made here)  Light the fire from the top and let it burn down  Stay outside when it gets this smokey, it fumigates the hut  When fire can be seen through a given hole it should be sealed  Use mud to do so  Finally, seal the top with mud (this took 2.5 hours)  Add water to cool the mound, the charcoal won't get wet  The next day the mound is opened  The mud is set aside for use in the next batch  Unburnt wood is set aside for the next batch too  The charcoal yield  The charcoal is better quality than the that of the pit method. It is larger and denser with a higher energy content  Sieved again to grade the charcoal, there are fewer smaller lumps with this method too  For the third method a permanent charcoal kiln is build to save labor with each batch  A cylindrical kiln is made of mud  This one is 50cm tall, 50cm wide and has 6 air entries  The kiln is fire dried so it won't crack during a firing. Cracks let in air that burn the coal to ashes.  Wood is stacked into the kiln in horizontal layers  It is finished with a conical pile on top  This way only the top needs to be coated in mud with each batch, saving labor  The kiln is lit from the top and allowed to burn down  When fire reaches the bottom it's time to seal the air entries   Finally the smoke hole is closed after the air holes are sealed after 2.5 hours The next day the temporary top is removed while the rest of the kiln remains intact The charcoal is good quality for less work than the mound method  The charcoal is sieved again  The kiln also made more charcoal than the mound for the same time and floor space due to it's greater volume. It can be reused when ever charcoal is needed to be made"

Apple's latest iPhone 14s and 14 Pros with all of the latest and greatest In Case Technology all the latest quirks there's a lot of innovative and new stuff here I'm excited to try and of course seven years after the first video here I'm back with our fourth generation of our personal products the phone Rebel Rebel Series so yes I do have a case company now thanks to these videos I'll try to keep it fair as always this is 50 feet well above the norm where your phone tends to drop at but it's at these extremes where we really see where these cases shine so without any further Ado got a stack of iPhones here let's get to dropping we'll start with the Apple clear just an average case I think this is a good Baseline for what a case should be for the average Joe nothing special all these phones are using our Rebel glass Gen 2 which is a 0.5 millimeter custom made glass just so they're all fair as always there's a degree of Randomness to how these will fall but generally you get the idea the more material there is on a case in the critical areas the more matters Apple clear case two one wow that's quite the impact massive crack here this is a PC Plus pmma Tech which is very brittle good for scratches though magsafe is delaminating incredible Survivor and next up we got the phone Rebel Rebel series gen 4. the culmination of our hard work our fourth release this one pairs gorgeously with the Deep Purple 14 pro nice tight fit so these are the ultrasile buttons that are upgradable to match the Apple watch Ultra all right let's see what this bad boy can do been wanting to try this one out for a minute here Rebel series Gen 4 dropping in three two one always nerve-wracking foreign to the light here gnarly chunk there right into that corner and phone is off this tends to happen with the heavier phones glass is intact what an impact we do have the shock absorbers inside they relatively did their job for the glass see if we can hard reset it we got a little law enforcement visit here everything's okay the iPhone is actually just booted up 14 pro survived with some minor band damage but a mean drop Rebel Gen 4 A-Okay and one more drop on the rebel just to bring the point home two one why did these uh Pros have a propensity to shut off all the time so screen protector delaminated glass is intact face down impact so our Corners raised Corners took the brunt of that see if we can get this to boot up again yes this bad boy has booted we're back in business all the lenses seem to work and the rebel series Gen 4 on the crisp 14 in red two one wow face down how did we do Rebel series glass saved the day let's see what happened underneath it yes looks like the glass is pristine underneath oh that's a nasty gouge but the material we have in the corners definitely did its job and next up is the mouse Limitless 5.0 I got to give these guys props they are tried and true for durability I see they took constructive criticism re-added the microfiber back in as a plastic on glass contact not exactly great for shock resistance personally not a fan of the banana curvature and the soap styling but let's see how it does this year two one if this survived I will be impressed oh yeah surprisingly did its job glass takes most of the credit there is delamination happening on the display frame bent I would say this is a Survivor next up The Nomad rugged case nice raised edges bold design bold shapes p-e-t back plate with co-molding very simple but effective styling too one first fatality if not I will be very surprised wow Rebel glass taking the Brunt of today's impacts definitely needs more lip protection we did the job the Aero grip by Incipio is uh definitely unique one I haven't seen done this way before with these winglets on the side apparently aeronautically inspired give them props for being unique let's see if it actually helps how interesting is that looks cool almost interferes with usability though two one nice face down all right this is our first fatality yeah the glass did as much as it could and the back plate has cracked huge Bend right there where the glass is actually coming out this gives you an idea of just how much force running through everything and next up is a continuation of our Legacy the phone Rebel Flex series this is our exposed side continuation we started with this style and this is the third version our sleekest yet more band exposed we now have shock absorbers inside definitely unlike any other phone case out there bare metal feel exposed sides huge corner protectors let's see how it does two one from what I see the front of the screen looks okay wow a little nervous here look at that took that impact it's rattled no glass breakage and phone is booting up so definitely a Survivor no metal deformation this time what an impact here's that Rebel Flex series on the iPhone 14. huge upgrade in Aesthetics got the TP shock absorbers full TPU enclosure design see if it made a difference two one nice Corner impact I love when you get that perfect drop and you just see it arcing down wow I just love how it completely demolishes the material all in the sacrifice of the greater good here as the iPhone is pristine has survived I've never tested these before the cadabe synthesis wacky looking lens leveler two one I think that was a face down impact Rebel glass saved the day yes it did again I would say not enough lip protection we got delamination here phone is ever so slightly bent I mean this thing has come a long way I remember these six days where almost every single phone came out just mashed yeah that's a Survivor and the first I've seen an aluminum lens surround from decoded looks great nothing specifically remarkable about this one I thought the lens would be an interesting study here two one that's a double Wipeout so aluminum has properties that steel doesn't you see all the fissures the glass is practically sitting on top of the aluminum here that Gap there but did survive and the Pelican Shield two-piece case way above and beyond what you'd need coal molded over Airmen fiber definitely gonna protect your phone from all manner of Falls two one oh I think I saw chunks flying oh wow what's this oh that's the latch case has separated and absolutely crumbled a feature not a bug I basically took the brunt of the entire impact here magnet has fallen out phone is intact and the tried and true D brand grip with a nice nothing skin two one from the way it bounced excellent energy rejection a disappointing result here screen has been demolished definitely a lot of warp here and we've got a recent Contender the banks Airmen or sorry Kevlar Dupont Kevlar endorsed case here very simple rigid side walls shaky buttons almost no lip protection on the front two one straight on the back screen looks intact here the phone did survive the case did its job Banks well done in the elements Case Black Ops not your standard run-of-the-mill case 250 dollars absolute unit of a case that you have to bolt on this thing doesn't survive there's no excuse great design just yeah it's a it's a little much and this thing weighs a ton one wallet attachment ejection feature has worked phone looks intact what excuse would it have not to be though next is the OtterBox Defender XT this is a case you set and forget because it is a pain to put two piece cases on one Corner shot plastic part has partially ejected oh this is a shock for an OtterBox major crumple on the bottom this is a first on this channel case defy bounce returning again this year no changes that I know of massive bumpers definitely suited for these kind of Falls I think two one foreign glass did the job once again aside from a few dead pixels here the mag safe ring here falling out phone is relatively intact and two at once here UAG Monarch Pro a lot going on but feels sturdy these guys have always done well and a cheapy Spigen Tough Armor two one nice bottom impact and the Spigen two one kickstand has ejected wow for a GP case not bad at all and the UAG Monarch Pro a ton of material phone is intact and working oh wait wait wait spoke too soon oh no the aluminum crumpled concentrated there that's another one I'm surprised about with so much material such a clean drop all right let's take a look at our survivors really can't go wrong with any of these they all performed well some with technicalities but in the end the phone survived and uh was usable surprising ones that did not survive dbrand grip Incipio Arrow grip the OtterBox and the UAG not coming to see those there really comes down to preference eventually cases will be obsolete but until then choose phone Rebel I'm kidding we pour our heart and soul into these cases and we make them better and better every year got some great upgrades planned for uh gen 5. anyways just for this video running a 20 off promo and that's drop 20. links down below take 20 off all vulnerable cases throughout the end of the year thanks for supporting guys and helping us build the ultimate phone case and then after that whatever else peace"

Oh, that's right We made a bold move Well, it doesn't matter For example, if the weather is good we say, \"The weather is f*cking good\" That isn't really a curse... But it has to be beeped out abroad, right? - It's \"Damned World\" - That's right, that's right (They're not SEVENTEEN years old) You're all grown up That's right MINGYU, you give off the vibes of an athlete... Do you work out a lot? - I work out every day - He's serious about it Oh, so you're on your way I think he's on the train And then this is how you end up like Yang Da Il Even his bag is like the bag of kids who work out When I open my bad... \"What's in my bag\" is also a good content - Chicken juice - Oh, you have this, too We have this at our gym, too - Low-sodium chicken breast - This, this And then, this is calcium Multi-vitamins This, this - Peanut butter - Wow, peanut butter Oh, this guy is in trouble - I need to fill up with peanut butter - Hey, he's in trouble And I brought straps just in case we do back workouts today - I need to have protein afterward - Have protein He's in the moment If he's at this extent, he's in the moment - MINGYU, I didn't know you were this bad - I'm seriously in trouble You know this, right? You always work out at the same gym seven times a week And you occasionally go to a new place, and the stimulation from new people - That excitement - That excitement I kept reaching out to you for that Wow, he's in, he's in DINO, what should he do? I don't know, I just... I also enjoy working out, but I'm nowhere near this guy And then, his bag will get bigger You know what I mean, right? There's a bag that gym rats carry I did change it to a slightly bigger one But I figured it was too big for my level I felt a lot and returned to modesty I do have a bag that goes from here to here Doesn't Da Il carry that bag? Oh, I'm suddenly excited [PD] Did you two volunteer to come to \"GYM-JONGKOOK?\" - Yes - That's right Wait, did you volunteer? I volunteered I swear I volunteered - I love working out - He's talking like this right now - But he's actually in it as well - I enjoy it He works out 6.5 times a week Oh, really? So when we were asked to raise our hands if we wanted to go to \"GYM-JONGKOOK,\" we were the first to raise our hands Oh, is that so? Hey, DINO, I think you should build your body - Oh, I should - Because your face, your visuals... - Will suit a good build - Oh, really? People will feel betrayed if you don't have a nice body with those looks Is that so? What kind of looks are that... Some faces need to have a good body You dance Dancers have beautiful bodies There are dance muscles There are muscles that dancers have I'm planning to make you do partner workouts When we go on tour, we workout together Oh, do you visit the gym when you go on tour? - Of course - Of course, we visit one These are the machines at Gold Gym Machines from Gold Gym I have to pull that over there Machines that make you go insane Oh, they have these? Hey, I'm getting excited - It was my birthday two days ago - Oh, was it your birthday? - What did you do on your birthday? - I worked and worked out You're in - And recovered at home - You've got to work out on birthdays You're meant to work out on your birthday You have to work out It's a gift for yourself on the day We started asking this lately Let's say your girlfriend won't let you go for a workout Then, what would you do? But then, it's not just with workouts I shouldn't keep regarding it as a workout But the time for self-management, not just workouts, should be guaranteed Not just workouts... But there's the nature of our job... It's not like we work out all day long - It's an hour a day - That's right It doesn't take long to burn myself out (LOL) I can burn it all out in half an hour if I put my mind to it You can Oh, great I feel good today Since you work out a lot, do you have any questions... Actually, we were planning to do back and shoulder workouts today Oh, back and shoulders? That's nice It's great if you have something that you want to do When we woke up this morning, I asked, \"What did you work out yesterday?\" - \"Chest\" - \"Me, too, then let's avoid the chest\" We came to mutual consent, so... Ah, that's right \"What are you doing today?\" \"I'll be doing this and that today\" That's the conversation between average people But when people, who work out, are asked, \"What are you doing today?\" We say, \"Well, I guess my back?\" And, \"What did you do today? Chest? Okay, let's do back workouts together\" Do you do split workouts? - I do 3-day split workouts - Yes, I also do 3-day split workouts 3-day split workouts? Where? Where? - I do the chest and shoulders together - Chest and shoulders together I don't do many shoulder workouts these days And I do my back and arms Arms separately Oh, the arms separately? Then, you don't have lower-body workouts I'm avoiding lower-body workouts Because once I start, I have a feeling it'll drive me away from dancing Oh, that's right - Due to the nature of my profession - Oh, due to the nature of your profession Actually, it's best to start lower body workouts at a young age But you'll feel it when the time comes There's a moment when you feel the necessity to do it I always say this, but it's only right to start with workouts that you enjoy That's how you grow interested and find joy The same goes for your body It's not a bad thing to work out more on parts that you like Great, then let's do quick back and shoulder workouts in the style of partner workouts Because the two of you go on tour a lot, and you're members So, let's try doing workouts that are best for when you're abroad Our Natural Champion (90-degree bow out of adGYMiration) Let's warm-up Oh, but you've got good shoulders as a given And you also look good without your jacket Oh, this guy has a nice body DINO, is that your real name? - No, it's my stage name - It's your stage name, right? My real name is Lee Chan Is it Lee Chan? You've got a cool name, so why... I actually wanted to debut with that name, but... - It really is an honor - Oh, what do you mean it's an honor? We seriously looked everything up, and we bragged to our members... - Oh, really - That we were coming here A lot of our members are addicted to working out Oh, is there a lot? In SEVENTEEN? There are around seven or eight members who work out seven times a week For real? We work out for three to four hours even after the concert Oh, really? Idols now feel the need to work out, right? As we grow older... You're globally popular, so to go overseas... You never know, seriously... MINGYU, you're going to act Are you already acting? - I should start - You should Many Korean actors are going out to Hollywood these days Asians should have perfect bodies, too The speed of the workout and not getting injured while working up Being able to focus on the target with moderately heavy weights effectively That will be the direction of today's workout If you go on overseas tours a lot, you end up working out at the hotel Often, the equipment is insufficient And the weights might not be as heavy as you would like them to be Making the most out of them and applying them correctly to the target area Okay, that's it Try to maximize the range of motion for the first set [Jongkook] Pull it all the way down That's it One All the way That's it Seeing that there's a finger here, it means he's pulling with three Oh, great You learned it well Great Oh, great speed Feel it all the way Hey, that's great You're doing great right now But when you hold your grip, you roll up slightly You need to hook it Don't roll this Some people use their forearm muscles to pull, but that burns you out quickly Push it all the way One Great Two Okay Oh, great All I did was place my hand here, and this is coming up all the way You need to stay immersed to go all the way - Four - Great, five I'll add 5kg - Thank you - No, no, you guys stay put There are cases when you roll this up as you pull to pull further That's unnecessary Just do it as if you're stabbing someone behind you with your elbow - [Hanjin] Four - That's it, go - [Hanjin] Eight - Okay, go Hey, do you guys have a trainer?

      "corpus": "new driver screw drivers where the screwdriver oh my label maker I've been looking for that oh perfect I'm gonna label everything foreign I don't know that's all right hmm I've got it hey welcome to Demolition Ranch a few months ago back in December we actually went up to Montana and I shot a sword International mjolnir and I was like I want one for myself so I got one for myself it's chambered at the pool but oh look at that later come out here let me show you what we got over here like 100 months ago or more there was a company called Pinnacle armor and they came out with um a armor system called dragon skin it was actually in like the early 2000s they came out with dragon skin and it was all the rage well no one actually knew they just seemed really cool it was on TV it's on Future Weapons and it was cool and we actually got a set and tested it which is really hard because the company went out of business in the early 2000s too and so they weren't making any more you couldn't find anywhere the military wasn't supposed to sell it we found a set though and shot it and it actually did pretty good problem is it was really bulky but it did stop a lot so we actually have a brand new one another company has started making dragon skin that is brand new this is from stealth armor systems this has dragon skin in it inside this vest we have a panel out over here I'll show you but this is rated at level four plus so nij ratings go up to level four which will stop a 30-06 black tip and so this one is rated at level four plus which means it can stop more than that and we're going to test it today and see if it can stop a 338 Lapua Magnum I'm actually really excited about this let me show you what that armor looks like pulled out of this vest and then we'll show you the gun so we have two panels one was in the front of that one and this one was in the back I went ahead and cut this open because I wanted to see what it looks like but you can see we got dragon skin 2022 and it's actually pretty neat I don't know if it's stuck in here or not we haven't actually pulled it all the way up let's cut it a little more let's see what this baby looks like this is Strike face and you can see it has the kind of classic looking yellow Kevlar but then you can see each one of these so the reason they call it dragon skin is because they have these little ceramic discs that line up like scales and so it makes it a little bit flexible because a normal ceramic plate is not flexible because it's a big hard ceramic plate so this is flexible but also they overlap each other so they kind of help each other to stop so it will Flex when it hits and then behind we have these sheets which will catch bullet fragments that make it through ceramic pieces that make it you know that are pushed through and it's big it's bulky it isn't heavy it's light but the one downside to dragon skin well besides being heavy the other one was pretty heavy this one seems lighter the one downside though is it's just bulky it sticks out a lot more than a single plate but it is flexible that's the benefit of dragon skin and level four plus also stealth armor system makes other uh armor besides just the dragon skin four plus now let's go ahead and talk about this gun but first let's go ahead and talk about 338 Lapua Magnum that is a big boy and shoots very fast and we have a lot of it look at that good stuff sent To Us by Norma ammunition really appreciate them for supplying all the ammo today I think they have a decent chance of going through four plus but I I don't know there's only one way to actually know okay on to the gun but first how you guys doing today everything good everything cool all right onto the gun this like I said is the sword International mule near so mjolnir is Thor's hammer which is super powerful we have the most powerful AR right here it is a semi-auto AR platform chambered in a 338 Lapua Magnum I've actually not shot this yet um but we did paint it day one it came all black and we were like you know what let's cerakote this but instead we just painted it with some Walmart spray paint you know and then we put a can on the end so we have a suppressed 330 Pua AR we topped it with a little scope here just a little guy four and a half two seven so we can really reach out there also so we can take Demolition Ranch scientific testing to the next level we have a ballistic dummy lab torso in here we will actually see uh not only what happens if a bullet makes it through but just the blunt force drama if say it does stop at 338 Lapua Magnum but it still punches hard enough to hurt him we'll see his lungs bleeding which would be great we're starting small just a little tiny uh with a 50 cal Desert Eagle see if that'll stop it 50 AE baby yeah I hit him okay of course I hit him I never missed hold on let me put this in my my holster here concealed carry bro what are you carrying I'm just happy is that a 50a winning right there nothing came through of course we didn't expect it to uh I see no damage didn't feel it it's like a fly landed on him next up green tip five five six so you know we going deep uh in the armor out of the ACR let's see what happens every time I shoot this gun I'm like I need to shoot this thing more I wanna I wanna rip like a thousand rounds through this thing someday soon hit right there it's hard to see 556 teeny little hole uh but no damage he's got a little bit of a beer belly thing but don't we all you know solid 556 total stop barely even felt it tis but a flesh wound but it wasn't even a flesh one now 762 by 39 and this is some steel core ammo should be decent and penetrating but probably not level four God I'm Meridian look how good this thing looks all right we actually hit really close to the 556 762. that's a problem with Ceramics because it'll start degrading once you break those little tiles and then you throw another one in there they can make it through oh it did that's not a complete fail because we did hit the same spot twice and that's the downside of ceramic but I kind of still thought it would stop I wasn't trying to miss anything in the case that you get shot with a 556 your armor totally stops it and then a 762 by 39 comes in your armor totally lets it through uh you should definitely have some safety gear so these are actually from Refuge medical we partnered up with them and made a demo Ranch specific kit this one is just the bare minimum thing that you should have all the stuff that you should have at a range in case of some you know someone getting shot in case of an emergency this has everything you need if you don't go to range with something like this you should really consider getting something like this so this is just the bare minimum kit this has all of this stuff plus some other things that are helpful for like more minor injuries and it also has your carrying bags so this is called the smaller back kit so you can put it on your belt you can put it on a backpack we actually have one on the golf cart right there so this is this exact same kit we have it out here every time we come out here to the range it is right there we have them in multiple colors you black red orange tan green we have them all all this stuff is in here and all the things you would need for major and minor injuries here also both of them have a cat 7 tourniquet so you're good to go all that stuff we are selling on the bunker brand new website Linked In description below thanks to Refuge medical for helping partner with us make these things available get this at least please keep yourself safe get this if you want everything the queue fix chambered in 8.6 blackout it's a supersonic ammunition so a lot of energy this is a big heavy round flying we're gonna shoot left side I bet it stopped hit here which is away from everything else so that should not have hit any compromised panels ceramics and did not go through that was the first one no bruising over here probably got a little belly punch but not bad now I think so are they ready for that they're not ready for this bro I'm not ready you're not ready for this oh that's nice let's shoot this bad boy so this thing has a left-sided charging handle over here non-recipitating charging handle has mag release both sides Ambi has a forward assist dust cover and then of course no charging handle in the back since it's up here on the left side look at that freaking mag 10 Rounds of Fury we are at the 1 million yard range let's just send one see what it feels like oh yeah we got a nice trigger here new mag yeah buddy we'll hit the other targets down lower golly you guys have seen our 300 Win Mag ARS which is crazy that much power just in an AR platform and then you come out with a 338 and yeah uh even more power oh we knocked that one down we moved the plate we've been shooting at we were shooting just the front plate for all those other rounds we moved it to the back and we put the plate we looked at here which is a fresh plate right in the front now we are shooting three thirds of the Pua out of the sword at a fresh dragon skin plate will it stop it and then we'll go investigate what happened on the other one and what this one did fire oh man that hit hard we got us a belly hit I always aim for the belly right there now let's just see what we got here this is from this was the back side where that 762 by 39 went out so this is the backside 338 so this thing did stop at 338 Lapua Magnum dude right in there got stuff all falling out into my hands but nothing in the back all right we're gonna take this over table and dissect oh look at this one too so this is where the 762 by 39 did come through uh came out right there but you can see this guy has alien blood so all the blue is simulating blood inside them so it did go through Pass all the way through this dude's belly and hit some not necessarily vital it it might have fit vital like arteries in there do we get a spine oh yeah he's definitely paralyzed I think it came right through and broke that vertebrae there so I would say that's pretty vital hit let's do the one we're shooting first first let's go ahead and cut her open oh they're like little gray ceramic discs weird so that's what they look like there are a bunch of those things all layered in here here's our 50ae that is yeah that's a piece of lead stuck on some ceramic it did break one so 50a came and broke one oh there you go right there it hit that you can see all the ceramic is gone so these are like wrapped in like um looks like fiberglass so it has a piece of ceramic wrapped in fiberglass so that definitely deteriorated a little bit the 556 probably deteriorated it a lot more which made way for our 762 by 39 to come right through there's more of those broken those broken there's tons of chunks in there this one is totally empty so you can see it's just rock so when it hits and cracks makes it a lot less strong and then our eight six over here probably did similar things there's our eight six totally mangled these bullets are real tall real long it probably lost half its weight but it didn't make it through it stopped on to the 338 Lapua I wonder oh wow look at that you can see the chunks there the ceramic is the big hard layer that's made to break the bullet apart and take the energy and then these are all made to catch the bullet and that's what happened here so you can see back behind there all that's coming out the back side of this yellow and there's a bullet right there oh yeah dude look at that 338 Lapua that's the back end of the bullet right there and the front is totally smashed dude it looks like it didn't even go through to the next layer of this stuff no there's no hole there it caught it in the first half it's pretty good and I would say that is four plus protection on single hit once you start hitting multiple is when Ceramics start degrading you could put a 330 here here here you could probably get 10 on there but if you put another one through that spot it's going to go straight through okay we know it'll stop at 3 30 at Lapua and we also know that multi-hit is not great so I was like what about if we do like a multi-multi hit so we put the uh the vest up there has been shot one time and we're going to shoot it at least one more time let's go see if it stopped them all we also missed like half of those all right yeah hit hit hit hit hit and you got some on the barrel too yeah well let's see if uh the ones that did hit hurt our dude or if he is protected oh yeah well some of these went low but I mean you can see which ones went through and not many oh that one went straight through so this one missed the actual Dragon scan and just went through this poked him looked like a knife wound right here yeah I mean he took some to the belly button but that was just regular 762 by 39 wasn't steel core it stopped most of it but it led a few belly shots through but that has been wondering what what about if you do a multi-round hit with uh no armor on let's go see if they went through there are no rules oh man yeah he's well as you guys know I am a doctor oh there's a problem right there you're missing quite a bit of your alien torso I'm gonna be blue for the rest of the day hey guys thanks for watching Demolition Ranch I love you and I'll see you next time you're really gonna enjoy what we have here y'all okay okay yeah I'm good thank you it's quite simple there's only one rule in the demolition you don't tell mayor"

all right I insisted I'm like I had the money so you don't have to run down the fact that they just did that without asking is insane insanely nice people here all right so the street says it has three grams of proteins actually not usable protein for your muscle protein synthesis because it's collagen protein so you see protein Jello or any Jello playing tonight it's high in protein it's just

the salad let's try this out pretty good not bad not bad it's a salad I can egg I put oh I got so many of my second egg just because you guys think I'm joking about this no I actually eat it with the shell it's good meal number two down and I think we're at 53 grams of protein my goal is 200 grams of protein today but it's looking kind of rough on a positive note though I literally just found out that htlt sups is having a flash sale on these specific items they really have sales and actually Stacks with the code King so take advantage of it while you can guys look how big these mangoes are I want to buy one but I can't because of the 7-Eleven challenge should I get one for tomorrow though this is a very nice lady I was picking out some bananas and she's like sir and I'm like oh no am I doing something wrong I am from India yeah thank you she's like sir and I'm like oh am I doing something wrong she's like I just want to say your biceps are really nice I'm like thank you what's your name from India I have a lot of Indian teams that watch me shout out to all the kings from India you guys are so motivational and shout out to project Hill for spreading positivity those small comments can make the biggest difference in someone's day you getting some bananas but I'm not gonna eat these today I'm gonna eat them tomorrow guys this is the sketchiest thing I've done apartment and leaving the traffic holding on with three fingers and almost fell off a couple times Kings we've made it alive somehow that was the sketchiest thing thank you that was the sketchiest thing I've ever done in Thailand you're like you're my mother and I'm like the sun going are you going to school or somewhere you're going through school or somewhere or my graduation or something yes all right right now I'm trying on my finished custom bespoke suits I have to admit one of the biggest reasons I came to Thailand was because I saw a tick tock where you can get a bespoke suit for like 220 from this place called rain tailors usually bespoke suits are like in the thousands at least because everything's custom and made to measure I love a great deal and I was not disappointed the staff was so friendly I was very intimidated at first but they guided me through the whole process I got to pick the Fabrics the buttons the colors the Cuffs the lining and you can even add extras like extra Pockets but I chose to engrave my name into my suit jacket so everything's customizable and they measure your body so it's made perfectly to fit you you also get a free custom shirt but I decided to upgrade the material to a silk material look how beautiful this is I don't wear clothes often let alone suits but it was just such a good deal that I had to get two different suits I also got an overcoat and some shirts done but yeah a bespoke suit with a shirt with a tie starting at 220 US dollars is a steal here's the address if you guys are interested I just picked up our suits and now I need to get dinner so far I'm pretty impressed with the selection that 7-Eleven has in terms of healthy food and food that I can actually eat they have eggs that's an option beef jerky no it's not beef jerky can't eat instant noodles they have nuts maybe go for some nuts they have this pigeon brand I actually checked the macros not bad sauces I think I need to get some tuna these squid snacks aren't bad actually but they just have a ton of sodium it's almost suggested I should get these Sun bites because they're made from quinoa and they're supposedly healthy but the macros aren't that good in terms of protein so it goes off on these Sun Chips not gonna get cereal because it's a fake healthy food guys this might be a lifesaver they have Frozen white fish and just frozen meats I think this is the leanest thing I've seen all day but I don't think I need all this all right Kings I've decided what I'm gonna make for dinner got my ingredients and we're gonna head home to make the meal but I can't wait to get home from our bank tomorrow lunch guys I think that couple I think he's having some fun this is meal number three it's a fishbowl soup with a soy sauce egg and some tuna let's give this a taste test those noodles are made of fish and it's good broth is nice do you guys like eating tuna out of the can I do Kings I have bad news I just did the math and that was 44 grams of protein and meal number three so I think we're at 97 grams of protein for the whole day over three meals and I tried my best to always add protein into my meals but Kings I just don't think it's possible unless I eat like six meals a day at 7-Eleven to get 200 grams of protein I think if you're in a Russian you need a quick snack then 7-Eleven is great but Lester just go to 7-Eleven to get eggs chicken breast and tuna then you can hit your Macros but most of the things there don't have great macros unlike this I'm gonna finally open this box and hopefully it has what I need to save me oh my God yes I've been waiting so long for these I'm so happy I've literally dreamed of these because they got stuck in customs and now I finally have it oh and some other goodies but this is what I'm the most excited for kids I tried my best birthday cake flavor chocolate peanut butter double chocolate oh my goodness this will get me to my protein goals birthday cake flavor is my favorite oh my goodness I can't wait [Music] hmm double chocolate guys can you tell I've been waiting so long that eat these seagull bars [Music] and screw it why not I'm also gonna have a peanut butter chocolate [Music] I've been waiting so long for this Kings this is literally the tastiest there's just something in my teeth I'm sorry I failed but this is such an amazing way to fail um each of these has 20 grams of protein 220 calories only so filling and it has 15 grams of fiber in this one little chewy tasty bar is tastes literally like a soft chocolatey Snickers candy bar and they're literally the best protein bar I've ever had and I've had a lot of my time and if you guys want to try them out use code King Link in description they're called Seco bars and you can also use my code for pre-pump protein powders like comment subscribe thank you King so much for watching and until next time we're getting Shredder together but um first I'm gonna eat this um"

new ingredient I gotta try it out plain to get the real idea of how it tastes so sir could you please cut this open very ceremonial Vera is a succulent plant that's been used medicinally for thousands of years oh dude that looks slimy here in Lima it's usually found at emolliente carts which sell a load of natural power drinks meant to boost your energy right now I'm just gonna grab some oh yeah this vendor has consumed so much of this powerful liquid oh it's good it's like a seven-year-old just sneezed he can partly contain himself we found the most stoic guy in all of Lima I didn't have this feeling since childbirth I think salute salud it's like gak do you remember gak I don't remember a guy but I remember Kobe when you try to cough and the cup didn't come you know what I mean that is the slimiest thing I've ever eaten in my life I would say it has virtually no flavor there's a hard part in a salami part the texture of the hard part is almost like a dragon fruit but then the gooey part is incredibly gooey it feels like my first kiss a little bit why are people drinking aloe he says it's good for the skin also for the stomach it starts with freshly scraped aloe mixed with Maca soy milk and quinoa when you put this into a drink does it make the drink kind of gooey and slimy too start to disappear a little bit so it doesn't feel this way [Music] I'll say pretty slimy The Taste is good you can tell they put some sugar in there there's quinoa so you taste kind of like a weedy grain flavor to it it's definitely very rich we don't just have the drink to start out with we have this a very famous Peruvian sandwich stuffed with chicken onion tomato potatoes mayo and a yellow chili sauce the main flavor is it's like a blend of chicken and fried potatoes it's very crispy and it feels like the bread was made right now actually they make all of it at home it's food it's quick it's cheap it's made for on the go it's built to last [Music] let's get down to business oral I brought you here to Peru for three reasons first of all number one you're my friend I want to hang out with you bro number two you speak Spanish so you get home translated here because Spanish is the national language in Peru they have few different words but overall we totally understand each others is the same he's gonna say I'll get by just fine number three I brought you here to torture you why you mean touching me basically I want to introduce my daily life to you we lived together for several years in Korea now our lives have changed drastically you live in Miami and I travel for half the year eating exotic foods oh my God sorry it's just that this is the creepiest thing I've ever seen it's like in a Sci-Fi movie when someone's making a clone of themselves and it's not quite finished yet that's what this is well might as well eat it now I get to share that with you in a way that may make you suffer I see I I seriously have no idea why Sunny made me do this I came here I thought it was a full review show not a cleaning poop joke you know what I'm up for the challenge anything you do I'll do that's fair for the most part no man you come on you gotta do it you gotta do it all right this is breakfast but today we've got a lot more to eat you ready let's do it if you're on the hunt for the most prized local food catering to actual locals follow the people in Lima that means heading straight for the Beating Heart of Commerce the infamous Kamara Market the epicenter of the rag trade in Peru the last time I was in a market like this that had this Vibe I was in Legos in Nigeria and here it's just like an overwhelming amount of people noise honking cars people yelling out selling stuff people on megaphones yelling out what they have to sell and there's people from every Walk of Life there's food there's produce and then beyond that you can just see that there's people hustling from every strata they're like trying to figure out whether it's Beggars or whether it's people selling food or people just creating jobs that didn't exist before like this woman when she came to this Market this place just has a Vibe all its own right at the corner near the subway station you'll find the true gems of Lima's street food scene how long have you had a food stall in this market welcome to Georgina's spot she's president of the women's Association of sellers at Kamara Market 10 years here she's the one that directs that Association they bring food from the mountain the coast and the jungle they equalize and sell the food here here she's offering a Savory dish that hails from the Andes Mountains you have a very special dish what is the name of the dish you're selling here this is too I don't want to surprise you too much but there's actually a custom here in Peru there's a special part of the head people don't usually get to eat what part is that can you guess the eyes thank you for giving me the heads up I'm gonna grab this eye out right here there's a bit of skin attached to it there we go you know I have a technique to approach this I like heart so sure I just look at it and imagine this is a heart can you see let me show you something that ain't no heart I'm sure it's not bad it tastes a little bit like soap have you tried soap yeah chewy it tastes cheapy a little gaming but Savory this too that she's cooked this in is very nice can I tell you something eating the eyeball not a custom I just made it up so I ate the eyeball yeah for no reason can we still be friends this is also going to join the soup I can't wait to try out the actual final dish with maybe even more ice yes no de Cabeza also known as sheep head soup made by boiling the sheep head with potatoes onions corn and peppermint for hours why use the head and not just general meat when it's dished this too includes every part of the Cabeza cheeks tongue eyes and ears with some organ Meats tossed in as well she said no you can get anything she say that the testicles are excellent too it's the more you put the more delicious top with potatoes and corn then sink it with that soup I gotta say this is such a gorgeous dish if you want some flavor you can put this on your soup local demo lady and fixer for this series Marella sits down to show us how it's done this is goat cheese yes and this is like fried Peruvian corn a lot of texture a lot of crunch I put the parsley lime and you can put this Red Hot Chili and go with the chili oh that looks like it could be cheek meat oh yeah oh man it's very rich and warm it's such a Savory and comforting broth all the meat it's become really soft and tender but then here this corn the white one what do you call that it's distinct because it has these huge white corn kernels not really something we have in the U.S so I want to try some of that you can feel the starchiness it's interesting that the flavor of one corn kind of balance the flavor of the other corn it's pornography sorry I've used that joke like 10 times that one I'm gonna get some of this cheese it's the last thing I haven't done goat cheese I'm really blown away you can put a flip-flop in here and somehow it would still taste good you live in Lima did you grow up here no I grew up in the north of Peru so how long have you lived here eight years I mean this is legitimately my first day here we're out in the streets we're getting like the full immersive experience right off the bat for you what separates Lima from any other city in the world or in the country first of all Lima is really really big and everything is really quick everyone is so aggressive like it's kind of chaotic but I think in that it has like its beauty I'm going to say this in Spanish she said that yes is chaotic but when you start living here at the end it kind of like traps you and gets into your heart at its surface parts of Lima undoubtedly feel like crashing waves of chaos and disorder but when you shift perspective your witness the entrepreneurial Spirit within beyond that just serving food for her is a way to educate her kids to be entrepreneurs and encourage everybody to succeed in life [Applause] [Music] just down the road of the same Market a street seller turning the cows underrated offcuts into on-demand dining with this not tongue tongue not liver these here are beef lungs they're loans you didn't think we're just gonna have some fun noodles did you this dish is the creation of stall owner Tia Nina there's potato cowlungs and it's got noodles too you know how they prepare the Meat part they have to marinate it the day before and then they fry it put it all together with Peru's giant white corn and top it with red onion and a squeeze of lime I know you're supposed to mix it up but I think we should get a taste of just straight pure cow along I bet it's similar to the heart ah all you're gonna find out not like hard clothes actually more like chicken what part is that they ask why do you open the chicken test you know the gizzard yes it tastes like chicken gizzard a little bit for me gizzard can be a little bit more tough this is very soft and almost like spongy oh this is some of the best long I've ever had but it's not alone so this is some lima pasta right here and very delicious I think they're taking ingredients that don't cost that much money onions a lot of flavor there's the noodles for great texture potatoes and then using this unique off cut and then making it just taste extremely delicious so far we've just had three things we've had like a soup and then some slimy drink and then we're having this and uh it's not gotten me any closer to understanding like what is food in Peru there's a lot of variety you can find anything you want like from Seafood from this kind of food dishes without with pork with Fish And we have a lot of operation food too there is Asian influence here yes when the Second World War II come here and we have a lot of migration from Japan from China I'm sorry but when you mix Asian with anything it just gets better we cannot forget that there is a lot of indigenous influence too like the Spanish side and the Asian side mixed with the indigenous culture here and that's what we are tasting right here when the sun sets and the streets cool down the charcoal heats up this is the best time of day to eat outdoors here Alberto and his mother Alodia have been serving up one of Peru's most coveted late night snacks for 45 years this is our grand finale we've been eating street food all day and it all has built up to this moment right here with the antique how's that pronunciation exactly perfect what are anti-cultures [Music] is a tradition from Peru and it's made with the heart of the cow the beef heart is cut into small pieces and marinated in a blend of spices vinegar and oil when it comes to antique there's a lot of people cooking this up what is the secret behind doing it the best or better than anybody else he said that the secret is to put heart onto it cow heart or your heart he's hard what other types of meats are you serving here and what's popular so they sell also the stomach and the testicle because these are aphrodisiac those two I think you listed a bunch of stuff for them I think he has more than two selling I know plates here are also piled high with tripe or chicken gizzards why the offcuts and not these Prime Cuts that is using the Articles it used to be the extra cards from the meat that was fit to the slaves when the Spaniards came here but then with the time they start to eat it as well and God integrated in the heart of the culture ladies and gentlemen this looks spectacular it looks good it is there's a multitude of different grilled Meats on here there's only two skewers of testicles they're bigger on this one you can have that one so nice of you thank you cheers foreign [Music] it's not that bad is that bad yeah I think he's done a good job of cooking these up it's really spicy really strong charcoal taste the thing is worth the idea outfit that they taste by itself they have plenty of other skewers here oh you keep I'm not telling you you have to he's volunteering you're now a ball guy we have to try this next I love cow heart it is really good delicious it's oily because it keeps adding oil making it kind of Juicy the most striking thing to me about this meat is the charcoal flavor it's like right on the edge of being too much really Smoky almost like an hint of gasoline flavor if I'm honest yeah I got you but I think the point is people are probably usually drinking when they eat this because it has really strong flavors so if you have a buzz if you're six to eight beers in this is exactly what you want underneath the heart there's this loose meat that's not on a skewer what is that it tastes like that stomach oh really yes no way I was blowing my mind there's no gamey flavor nothing too intense it just tastes like that magical seasoning he's put on there this is like the mix of things that shouldn't work but somehow it works really well but then you should not work here starting with the balls I want to switch gears a little bit to talk about a different topic it may be a slightly sensitive topic and maybe not what you're expecting but I hope you feel open to talk about it what well about 10 minutes before this conversation I was on the sidewalk and a gentleman I assume you as a gentleman he drove by on a motorcycle and he tried to steal this phone from my hand unfortunately it fell to the ground and he sped away this is the first time this ever happened to me in your in my life oh my God yeah see well that reaction already tells me so much about the city yes how often does this kind of stuff happen in Lima like a lot it's like the most common kind of robbery here so when I make the show I feel a certain amount of responsibility when I go to places like Egypt and we had some difficult experiences I was straightforward about it and even today I should be straightforward in saying as we move around Lima as a team we have security who has a gun we have some different issues that you have in the states or in other places so you have to be prepared because a lot of class difference right economic disparity between the very rich and the very important and that actually in those types of economies is where you see the most crime I guess my big question is if people do come here what's the best way to conduct themselves in order to assure their safety they have to have their things with them try to walk in safe places with lights I'm a woman I'm aware all the time every time I travel I always do like a mental preparation because I believe that I'm leaving my home I'm in a foreign territory so I'm a weird entity and I'm actually even more vulnerable than everyone else you know in a way it's a blessing I didn't lose anything this time this is a warning and be prepared because it might happen again thank you for being honest I'm sorry best ever Food review show is a small team of independent creators and everything we do here works because of you guys click the link

      "name": "Mark Wiens",
      "corpus": "I'm in Bangkok Thailand and today I'm taking you to eat some extremely popular Thai street food for breakfast we'll be eating legendary stewed pork leg style chicken rice and juicy braised Goose a lot of delicious food coming up right now [Music] good morning hey everyone hope you're having an amazing day it's Mark Wiens I'm in yawara this is bangkok's Chinatown one of the great street food areas of Bangkok is [Music] so we're here right at 7am this is prime time this is some serious action going on behind me this place is called and they're famous for braised pork leg this is one of the most legendary one of the best places in Bangkok and they only open for breakfast they sell out in the morning foreign so they've been selling here for over 30 years and just at the front of the line here at the stall there's just I mean it's just overflowing with pork legs and Tails and Knuckles and eggs and just the Aromas the soy sauce the coriander root the cinnamon is filling the air and so I just ordered everything so he gets a selection of everything Chef's Choice he chooses a little bit of everything uh slices it up and when he gets that braised pork leg it just literally it's so soft and tender it just wobbles he slices it up over the rice with some more of that braising juice on top and then some pickled vegetables I'm not the aroma of the garlic oh I cannot wait to try it the skin the knuckle the foot bones the gelatin the collagen it's all in here I have to take a bite immediately the juices oh it's wobbly and fresh um [Music] oh wow oh it's so jiggly and soft it was incredible that's my first bite and what I like about it that's different from other places is just not sweet at all and you know what you can immediately taste in there peanuts it has a like undoubted aroma of peanuts and then when you keep on chewing it has this Aroma of the coriander roots of the cinnamon of the soy sauce the dark soy sauce the fat and collagen that's just melted out oh man yes the wobbles the knuckle the foot the meat and then it also comes with an egg but let's take one more bite and then we'll do a little bit of seasoning that pork literally melts in your mouth you literally do not need teeth for that you could chew with your gums and be totally fine this place is extremely popular again they're only open for breakfast starting at about 6 a.m a lot of people get takeaway but they do have some tables the side of the shop Palace along the sidewalk and they even have some tables across the street one of the joys of eating cow kamu braised pork leg is also the seasoning this would be the main sauce which is a combination of chilies and garlic sprinkle on here this is what can cut the cut the contrast of that fat let's add a little bit of chilies as well to bump up that chili level oh yeah okay let's just go straight in mix around that texture it's so gooey and soft and sticky and again I think a lot of that has kind of rendered out what you're left with is the skin the collagen okay and definitely some fat too but it just melts in your milk and I love it with that contrast of chili vinegar because that kind of breaks the richness oh man that taste is Incredible without a doubt this is one of the best plates of kakamu in Bangkok okay and then chase that with some of the Pickled mustard green soup there's some pork bones in here as well pepper in there oh that soup is incredible it is the flavor of the the sourness of the Pickled mustard greens and then a really nice pork bone flavor and then pepper coming throughout the back of your throat break into the braised egg oh oh that yolk you can see it's starchy oh that needs to be hydrated hydrated with some chili vinegar oh yes the flavor of all those spices destroy sauce I love that contrast of how the the egg white is kind of rubbery but then like breaks in your mouth and then that that's contracted by the starchy crumbliness of the yolk and then another component of this dish which I haven't dug into yet are the Pickled mustard greens which go along with that as well big skin pickled mustard greens chilies oh oh look at that chunk oh let's just stick it right on top oh yeah looks like a huge bite but it just goes down so easily because it just collapses and melts in your mouth and with the addition of the chili vinegar and the chilies that is the the greatest morning wake up call now we're really ready to begin ready to start this food tour off with energy oil okay and thank you I'm also excited okay Uncle mentioned the recipe is a tattoo or a tiocho recipe down from his mother and father he's been open for over 30 years and it's just a straight authentic traditional recipe and they've maintained the quality and their family recipe throughout generations and so that's why it remains so good and so popular that was extraordinary they're just so friendly as well highly recommended he said he's closed on Monday but he's open every other day starting at 5am sell out by 9 A.M and possibly sell out 9 30 possibly sell out even sooner than that it's just now 7 30 a.m prime time for breakfast number two and this place is called common guy playing Nam they're famous and just this is really old school place for Thai chicken rice boiled chicken rice uh hainanese in style and they have all the chickens fresh in the morning ready to go 8 A.M they're all boiled they're blanched they're ready to go Uncle chops them up over the rice with a fragrant chicken infused rice just ordered and our plate should be arriving soon just quickly to tell you what I ordered I got common guy peace and so that means chicken rice and I got the special version which usually means it's a little bit more it's a little bit bigger of a plate usually it's a little bit more meat and so that's what you get if you want a slightly bigger plate but it comes with everything so he chops up some of the chicken he chops up some of the organs there's liver there's gizzard and there's a coagulated blood Cube on the plate as well that all comes mixed however if you don't want all of the innards you can say are all of the innards and then you'll just get the chicken meat with rice however I would recommend that you try all of the organs as well because that really is a big part of it and all the different textures and all the different flavors that go into it okay that being said let's dig in actually before you've been trying the chicken one of my standard procedures just like trying the soup of a bowl is to try that Rice first because the rice is really the foundation of any plate of chicken rice you can tell a lot by just the rice oh yeah that is so sticky and fragrant the garlic in there oftentimes when they make uh chicken rice the rice It's a combination of glutinous rice and regular rice giving it that sticky gooey texture and then it's cooked down with the fat and the broth of the chicken so it's just infused fatty chicken rice that's just oily and glistening and Rich and so much flavor salty and garlicky you really taste the friggins of the fried garlic the other major component of any chicken rice is the sauce and let's ease our way into the the chicken first with some rice oh wow the skin is incredible it's fatty and bouncy and then you've got the texture of the chicken the chicken they're definitely using a special type of chicken uh it has a great muscular texture and it's just amazing how lean the chicken is yet how fatty and bouncy the skin is I love the sauce I love the ginger it is mostly salty a hint of sweetness to balance it and then you taste the fermentation of the bean sauce or the soy sauce in that sauce I think this one is liver next look at that liver hmm that crumbles and it's so moist all the liver and I'd probably say liver is my favorite organ of the chicken like it just kind of liquefies on your tongue oh even got the whole heart this is extra special okay that needs to be sauced sauce the heart and we're going in that heart is actually huge that's a giant chicken heart really good texture really clean tasting okay we got some pieces of the gizzard oh wow even the gizzard is not that crunchy sometimes because it can be a little bit crunchy this one has a nice bounciness this is a really solid plate of chicken rice really good really traditional the flavors are clean and just so like condensed in the chicken flavor you can tell that they don't take any shortcuts they use a full amount of chicken fat and yet it's not not overly oily you can taste the naturalness of everything one more part to taste which is the blood coagulated blood Cube blood jelly that's straight like silky tofu chicken tofu tofu I just completely like it liquefies it dissolves on your tongue it's so soft and tender oh you taste the freshness of it and you can tell there's no no additives it's just straight up the blood that's just coagulated until it hardens [Applause] the liver that's definitely the Highlight that's my favorite part of the chicken a couple of my cup oh that was so good we're moving on to the next place [Music] Chinatown in Bangkok is really waking up traffic is picking up but before we go to breakfast number three we're gonna stop for a for a quick drink well actually I'm quite thirsty after eating two breakfasts so just want to stop for a quick local style coffee here on the side of the road foreign I just love the culture like this so friendly people kind of congregate here from cab drivers to took drivers to just people passing by getting their morning coffee morning tea this is the type of place you could order chaiyan which is Thai tea or Thai uh lemon tea lime tea but I'd like to order something called oleang which is old Thai Chinese style coffee black coffee a lot of iced coffees because it's quite hot already I got a bag of Olean and yeah like I was mentioning a lot of people get iced coffee because it's already 9 A.M the humidity is just sky-high just walking around eating and you're just like covered drenched in sweat so a lot of people choose for the iced coffee but this is good it's just very simple I mean it's not not gonna not a gourmet roast or anything it's just that classic dark charcoaly brew that just hits the spot especially when you need some refreshment in the morning I don't know like after eating two breakfasts and anyway we're on our way it should be just up ahead I think down the next street for breakfast number three [Music] next up on this breakfast Thai street food tour we are on this is yawarat road but we are just off the road this is 23 and right down here you'll see there's almost continuously a line of people that are waiting to order a dish called kamudeng which is rice topped with red barbecued pork which is similar to chatsu the Thai Thai Chinese style of chasu often including which is the Tai Chinese sausage and also mukrab which is crispy pork belly all over rice with a red sweet sauce all over it and so this place is called kamudeng naio and it's a legendary Place they've been serving for 50 years it's a Heritage Restaurant we're gonna order we are gonna see them as they make the process and talk a little bit with Auntie and that's what we're eating next they do things the traditional way Auntie is extremely friendly she chops up the sausage the barbecue pork the crispy pork belly the egg eggs and the rice is still served in a wooden barrel which is something really cool that you won't find everywhere and then the sauce which is this red oh here comes a fresh batch of the sauce like thick sticky sauce is poured into bottles into like whiskey bottles before it's then just poured over the entire mixture we're gonna order piset which is the special which comes with everything included and then try this out so much sauce the barbecue pork the crispy pork belly the sauces sausage that's all in here and then it's just so Saucy and a mountain of rice I'll get some of that maximize the sauce on this first bite mmm and the portrait drive here I think they appreciate their special version is 60 Baht that's less than two dollars but that's a big portrait of food she literally like takes two handfuls of rice patch it down pounds it down uh compresses it before adding in all the meat before just drenching it in that sticky sweet Porky sauce and the flavor typically kamu dang the sauce is a little bit on the sweet side so it definitely is a little bit sweet but it has a nice depth of flavor it's not only sweet it's Porky there's a little bit of seasoning it's not like overly strong but like a little bit of a star anise flavor to it then you've got the pork the barbecue pork you've got the the crispy pork belly is one of the highlights here and they say that that's the thing the first first thing that sells out here and then you've got this sweet Chinese sausage which also adds the sweetness to it the rice is really fragrant really fluffy and then yeah I mean it's just a it's just a hearty simple dish focused on the roasted meats and just that sauce look at how sticky that sauce is and they they're quite generous with the amount of sauce with the amount of ingredients and toppings and that crispy pork belly let's let's isolate that crispy pork belly but before we try that we need to do a little bit of seasoning so most of the time ties would add on drizzle on some of this uh sweet soy sauce a little bit I'm not a huge fan of the sweet soy sauce maybe just a little bit but it is very common to add to this and then also something that's mandatory are the the Chili's vinegar chilies which these are not necessarily very spicy but it does provide a nice little vinegary contrast to the sweetness and the richness of all those meats so I'm going in definitely going to isolate that piece of pork belly with all those toppings now okay the pork belly is a highlight without any doubt that skin is so crispy and you really taste the fire smokiness of it one of the condiment seasonings that I love about comeding is always they have a sometimes a cup sometimes an entire bucket of green onions fresh green onions that you can grab and Chase oil that completes the bite oh that goes up your nose a little bit let's move into the egg next this is definitely one of the highlights as well add a little more to that sauce and you can see the egg is soft boiled so the yolk Still Remains kind of oh this should actually just be one bite [Music] nothing just satisfying as a one biter egg New York squeezes out the sauce the sauciness and the yolk is kind of the the whiteness kind of melts in your mouth always at the same time you cannot tell where the yolk starts and the white begins it's just all kind of like completely like silky in your mouth all at the same time a lot of different like the meats are a little bit on the sweet side but I'm really impressed most with the crispy pork belly the mukrab here is just awesome just the crispiness and you really taste the fire smokiness of it here check the top here's a piece of the pork belly look at that it's so crispy and ironically look the crispy pork belly doesn't even feel feel fatty it's not jiggly it's not gelatinous it's just the meat the saltiness and the crispiness of the skin if you look now you can just see it is packed you can see that there's people waiting in line people delivering delivering big plates of kamodang that crispy pork belly something awesome foreign [Music] which is the Cantonese Chinese sausage it's definitely very sweet and I wouldn't say that it's one of my favorite things because it's so sweet especially as an adult but definitely when I was a kid I loved it and whenever I eat it it just brings back good memories from childhood with my grandma that's also part of the reason why why I like this dish really good and really filling and this plate is huge oh man I'm starting up fully sweat from the digestive sweats the meat sweats are starting to kick in and just the humidity of Bangkok oh man I took one makeup so and he was just explaining the street style is 50 years old her father and mother started it and they sold her and her father still comes sometimes uh she said every now and then especially one day per week he'll come but that thought the recipe came from her father two generations maybe three generations but 50 years of selling this this year this is a Heritage street food stall in Bangkok I'll come back up they're just so nice so friendly so much experience 50 years and look as we're leaving check it out the crispy pork belly is finished sold out I think that's it for the day and it's like 9 30 a.m that was delicious they're so friendly and we're gonna keep on eating we have one more place this is going to be the grand finale now it's not so much breakfast anymore but it's turning into brunch coming up next foreign [Music] close to the next place should be just down the road from here which is called Chua Hang Seng Han Palo and they are famous especially for their braised goose and I've never been to this place it was recommended it's very popular locally but it's kind of off the beaten path from the main road so we're gonna check it out hopefully we get a taste of their legendary Goose so this restaurant they've been selling for 45 years it's another Heritage Goose Restaurant they have the goose up here at the front which have been braised in a variety of seasonings I'm sure some soy sauce some five star anise probably some coriander roots and garlic and cinnamon the Aromas here I love just how old school this place is this is like original Decor antiques relics from 45 years this is a shophouse style restaurant we ordered a plate of the goose which he grabs from here and then he chops up just delicately all the different parts you know okay and then he just scoops on drenches it in some of that goose juice and then what's cool about this place is they have tables all the way down in the alley so I'm gonna just walk down here okay come down here and down here is where you'll find some seating in the alley and they even actually have another shop here where you could sit as well but we got a table right here what a location what a spot for goose this is just my perfect atmosphere for eating in the back alleys of Bangkok I just love the atmosphere and I love how it's a shop house they slice up I mean they've been brazing Goose for 45 years this place is again a Heritage Restaurant that broth is so aromatic you smell all of the spices in there probably the roots and medicinal Chinese herbs that go into that broth and that braising liquid served with rice served with a chili garlic sauce oh look at that oh man I want to just hydrate it as much as possible get it fully fully Juiced with that braising liquid okay wow all that broth is so so medicinal tasting so herbal tasting so like Rudy tasty you taste all those roots in there that the coriander root probably all those dry Chinese medicinal herbs and spices that go into that that liquid to braise it oh and yet it's so smooth at the same time the meat itself is extremely lean and then the skin just kind of like dissolves the fattiness just dissolves on your tongue that the braising liquid is delicious though oh it's so so good take some of the goose dip it into the the sauce garlic chilies vinegar that is extraordinary oh yes in combination of the soy sauce the acidity of the vinegar to break down the richness plus the garlic push the green chilies oh there's coriander in there as well that's also giving a nice herbal touch over on this side we have some different parts of the goose this is more of the thigh maybe looks like more skin I'm going to add some of this next to my rice this juice is insane this Goose juice and then add on some of the sauce the goose juice is insane it's so much whatever oh man and it just tastes kind of like light at the same time like it's not too heavy not overly rich the perfect balance all that stunningly tasty wow so good and then we got a soup chicken feet soup chicken feet chicken next chicken parts there's some Goji berries in here look at how milky that broth is wow that's like thickened chicken you could just tell the taste the melted skin and fat in there Rich thick a little sweetness from the Goji berries but just like a really pure kind of chicken broth I can't get over that goose juice that could be a beverage you could just sit here and drink that goose juice it's so flavorful the goose is wonderful but the goose juice it's truly like I mean literally you would be happy with just a cup of the goose juice over rice or even just drinking taking a shot of that goose juice it's so good oh man it's still good I think this is I guess Goose goose blood take a bite of that that goose and blood and then Chase it with a goose juice let me tell you you cannot get enough of that goose juice and I just love saying Goose juice I can't stop saying it it's so much fun and it tastes so good oh wow it's a sad moment down to the end of the plate with just a little bit of juice left one more bite okay only one only one way to do it no Goose juice is going to waste oh yes oh it's so happiness I think I could just sleep for the rest of the day no thank you for the

      "corpus": "[wind blowing] PETER: Good morning, from Phoenix. If there's one thing I've learned by making videos in the United States it's that you can't put an easy label on this place. So many different types of people living in so many different types of ways. So today we're gonna go two hours west from Phoenix out into the desert to get into a community that's living from what I'm told, somewhat off the grid. In RVs, in trucks, in cars. Some by choice, fleeing that very cold weather up North. Others by necessity. So let's get out there, talk to these people, and see what we can learn about this lifestyle. Let's do this. [mellow country music] [truck driving on gravel] PETER: So guys, this is one of those videos where I just sort of wing it. Lot of videos have someone planned up to meet up with a story but this one is... Let's find it. PETER: So how long you been doing this for? RANDY: About five years now. We sold our house in Atlanta. That was gonna be our forever house. We remodeled it, we spent a lot of... Heated floors, waterfall in the back yard into a pond with koi fish, you know? And then one day we're out in Yellowstone in the park. We had rented an RV. We're driving one morning, the sun's coming up, we're looking at each other like, \"We could do this.\" [Peter chuckles] -So we did. We enjoy it. You meet so many good people. -Is this your buddy right here? -Yeah, this is Ram. He's been doing this for, like, 17 years. PETER: Oh, wow. All right, guys, that didn't take too much work to be honest. PETER: How you doing, sir? RAM: Pretty good, you? -Good. -My name's Ram. -Ram, Peter. -It's a pleasure to meet ya. -Nice to meet you. PETER: So you're saying I go down here... RANDY: The street right here... PETER: Okay. RANDY: Go down to the stop sign and in front of you is gonna be wide open nothing. There's like 14,000 acres of Bureau of Land Management land. And you go pick your spot. -Anyone can camp out there? -Anyone can camp out here. -Can you stay as long as you want? RAM: They have two week, move two week... Whatever, but then they have like us. We pay $180 for, like, six months. RANDY: For six months. RAM: And they have water station, and a place to dump your tanks, and your trash, and all that. PETER: So this is a good zone? RANDY: We think so. You really want to see the crowd, go down to South. RAM: Oh, yeah. PETER: How many miles is that? -From here, once you hit the main road, maybe four miles. PETER: How many people do you think are living out there in the desert? -Right now probably at least... At least a quarter million. -[Peter surprised] Quarter million? RAM: During the RV show last year... PETER: Wait, wait... RAM: 1.3 million people were here. RAM: Last year... RANDY: You missed it by a week. RAM: You just missed the RV show. PETER: All right, let me get that straight. Just out here, quarter million people in the desert? -You've got about 14,000 acres out here of Bureau of Land Management. There's about a quarter million people out there right now. -Well, if this is empty, I can't imagine what it was. Look at this, guys, for as far as the eye can see here... RVs. Both sides of the road. [Truck banging over speed bump] PETER: So Craig, what's the story with this truck? It's a Harley-Davidson edition? CRAIG: Yeah, it's a 2011 Cummings ISX 13-speed auto PETER: Look at the design on this. Who comes out here? All different types or is it like... -Everybody from somebody camping out of their car to the $2 million Class A. We see everything. [gravel crunching] MAN: I'm a retired, after 28 years, law enforcement. I did... My last 20 years was as a federal game warden on the East Coast. And I had to retire because of medical reasons. I decided I'm not gonna sit on my a**, and live the rest of my life watching Netflix on the couch. I wanted to be outside like I have been for 20 years. PETER: Gotcha. -Doing my job, so I decided... I watched videos and saw people doing this. I'm like, \"I wanna come out here and do this.\" And I love it. [four wheeler revving] PETER: How's the vibe out here? You guys get along pretty well? BOB: Oh yeah, we get along great. ROBERT: Oh, yeah. PETER: When you see the Confederate flag that doesn't bum you out or anything? -Why? -Okay, tell me. Tell me. [Bob laughing] ROBERT: Why? Why should it bother me? PETER: All right. ROBERT: It's a freakin' flag. It's the North Virginia battle flag is what it was. PETER: Yeah, I don't get into politics but it's just you have all different types, all different flags, and everything seems to sort of jive from what I see. -Yep. -I was with the naked circle. Is that what it's called? BOB: Oh, you went up to... ROBERT: You went to the magic circle. PETER: Oh, it's a magic circle? [all laughing] PETER: There are a lot of old men with their junk hanging? ROBERT: I tell you what, my coworker in here, he's 85 years old, and that's where he lives at. BOB: There's a lot of big RVs back over here. Way back over here. PETER: There's an ambulance over there. BOB: Yeah, that's my ambulance. PETER: That's your ambu... You're living in an ambulance? -Yeah. -You feel safe in there? -It is very safe actually. It's very secure. You're not gonna get in there once everything's locked up. BOB: Some people just can't take it. It's just too... You know, you can't be negative, because negativity just destroys everything. -Okay. -Um, you just gotta cope. It's always something that you gotta deal with. Somethings wrong... This guy back here... His transmission broke, and he cant' fix it here. So he had to go down the road and fix it. -Okay. -And it's always something. That's kind of a phrase that everybody has, \"Well, it's always something.\" You know, \"This broke, that broke.\" -How long you been out here? -I've been traveling around the country since 2014 and for... This is my third year. Where I just got rid of everything I own. -Do you know who lives here? -Yeah, Kelly and Riz. -And they're living full-time there? -Oh, yeah. PETER: So this is your ambulance? BOB: This is the ambulance. I wish I'dda washed it. I was gonna wash it yesterday. I didn't wash it. If I'd known you were coming I woulda washed it. -It's looking good. -A lot of these guys go and they convert their ambulance into an RV. -Okay. -I refuse to do that. Because I'm an ambulance purist. -You have a podcast? -I do. -Oh yeah, there we go. Bob, what's your theme? -Just living out here and traveling. Stuff like that. -All right, so go ahead and check out Bob's podcast if you want more intimate detail. -There ya go. Sometimes very intimate. So basically... -Out at the magic circle it gets very... -It's still an ambulance. -Okay. -Unfortunately my welcome mat is that but yeah. It's just still an ambulance. You don't have to do anything. Plenty of storage. -Right. Built in already. -Built in already. -You have, [knocks] insulation? -Yeah. [knocks] -Yeah. No, it's very well insulated. It'll get cold but we have heat for that. -And, you know... All these systems that people put in these vehicles are highly overrated. -Okay, so what's your theory on that? Just keep it simple? -Keep it simple. Here's my cow skin blanket. [taps bench] -Where you sleeping? On the ground? -Yeah, I roll all this stuff out on the ground. -This is the office? -This is the office. -We produce everything here. -Who's we? -Me. -You're calling you, we? -Yeah, the royal we. -Okay. -And this is the electronics area. -Or is it \"We\" means you and the ambulance? -Maybe it does. Maybe there's someone else in there that I'm unaware of. -You come as a unit. -So hard to tell. This is it, you know, I mean we got a little pantry right here. -Okay. -Almost all the cooking is on a campfire. -Can I, uh... [cabinet clicks and opens] There's the pantry. -Refrigerator? -Don't have a refrigerator. -Okay. -Eventually I'll get one but I haven't got one right now. My plan is to get solar and then I'll be able to get a 12 volt refrigerator. But basically all the cooking we do is all on a campfire. [metal banging] PETER: Oh, sorry. That's the podium for the sermons? You have sermons out here? -This is the podium for the podcasts. This is where we... \"And now, ladies and gentlemen...\" PETER: Today's video is sponsored by Bespoke Post. Bespoke Post is a monthly membership club delivering a Box of Awesome.

Now back to the story. -So what do you get out of this lifestyle? Break it down for those that have no clue. -Freedom, freedom, freedom. It just boils down to that, freedom. I don't pay rent. I do what I want when I want. I can get up at noon or I can get up at 6:00. You know, I have a little business. So I do my thing and I'm here because of the high price of diesel. I just refuse to pay the high price of diesel. So a bunch of us, Mike, over there in that school bus. -Mike's in the bus? -He and I both are just furious about diesel prices. So we're just hanging out refusing to pay diesel. -So when diesel comes down are you gonna get on the road? -Yeah... No, I'm crazy. The first year I traveled full-time I went back and forth across the country up and down. Ran the whole border, went up and down across the country, coast to coast twice. It was crazy. I must have done 25,000 miles then. PETER: Wow, look at him. BOB: We would like to be able to... All of us would like to be able to travel a little more than we are right now. We're just kind of hanging out because of... But the price of fuel is coming down, so... It's happening very slowly. ROBERT: That needs to happen faster. PETER: Do you listen to his podcast? ROBERT: No. [all laughing] BOB: And it's a good thing. ROBERT: I don't because we would probably end up in arguments all the time. -Because you're listening to him over there every day? BOB: Or around the camp fire. ROBERT: We have... I won't say opposing. We have different political views. PETER: That makes it fun, spicy. ROBERT: We argue. BOB: We argue. -[Craig laughing] We were arguing last night around the camp fire. -I said, \"Get out of the truck and fight.\" And he said, \"I will shoot you. [all laughing] ROBERT: I don't fight fair. PETER: He's a cop. An ex-cop, you really want to go there? He's got skills. BOB: I was kidding. PETER: So summertime, you guys are getting out of here, right? -We'll be here 'til... Ian and Mike were here 'til June last year. BOB: Not here but we were down at... PETER: You just sweat it out? -It's great, I love the heat. -You go to the magic circle at that time? -No, I do not. [Peter chuckling] PETER: So super social out here? -It can be or it can be not social. It just... You don't... You know... You don't approach people unless they approach you. If you start talking and then whatever... Over time you get to know people. -Okay. -And then they invite you over or you invite them over and then, you know, there's some rules. If you can, you bring your own plate, and your own chair, and your own fork. Most people are very giving. So they're giving their food. If you want to bring food, that's fine. Sometimes I go over to his thing. I'll take a steak over there and cook it on his fire while I'm sitting there or whatever but it's social, and the thing is camping with guys, you know, it's social, and then if I don't talk to him for three days he doesn't care, and vice-versa. So it's a little easier camping with guys than it is when you camp with women, it's very social. -Yeah, what is the singles scene like out here? ROBERT: What singles scene? BOB: Well these are not... These are older women, generally speaking but\u2026 It's nonexistent. ROBERT: And the younger women tend to be van-lifers and that. -Not just that but younger women are like... ROBERT: They are all into... Um... [Bob laughs heartily] -They're all into either each other... [Bob laughing] -I'm not saying I disagree with that, you know? I like to watch but, um... Or they... They... Social justice runs strong out here. It does. It does. PETER: I saw Trump flags everywhere. -There's that too. -Those are the anti-social justice. PETER: Okay, so you get both camps out here. -Those are older people and they tend to be older Caucasian husband and wife teams. Is what that tends to be. Um... With your van-lifers and some of your schooly people, it's the other side of the spectrum. It's the old hippie... BOB: Young hippies. And they're actually pretty cool. PETER: Which are? The young hippies are cool? -I think they're real... I think they're... I would love to be... If I was that age I would love to be doing what they're doing, and what they do is part of their realm. Which is there's a lot of patchouli and, you know... PETER: So it's just old school hippies? BOB: Yeah, basically. -What's different about the hippies now versus the hippies before? BOB: I don't know. ROBERT: They don't care about the environment. PETER: Now? ROBERT: Now. BOB: You don't think they care about the environment? -I don't think they care, you saw what happened over there in Dome Rock? They were frickin' cutting down and burning trees. BOB: For firewood, and then they didn't like my friend 'cause she's a Christian, so... They got into it. They had to leave. PETER: They don't like Christians out here? -That was my take on the whole thing. And they... No, most people... There's a church over there. There's an open-air church over there and most people, it's like whatever, you know? We're not making judgments about religion. It's just this particular group. And I wasn't there, so it's hearsay from my perspective but they were making a lot of noise and the girls got upset that they were making a lot of noise, they went over there and tried to get them to turn it down. They wouldn't. -[man speaking from a distance] ...you were yelling at. -He's got fresh clothes, his hair is combed. BOB: He's all ready to go. PETER: Oh. [all laughing] BOB: We're making a video. This is Mike. PETER: Yeah, they were really talking you up. How you doing, Mike? Peter MIKE: Nice to meet you. PETER: So what's going on out here? You're sort of the OG in this space? -Little bit. -How many years? -17. -Wow. So you did it before it was trending or cool? -Just got sick of the city. I didn't like the high cost of housing. -Okay. -I was just sick of it, man. -What city? -Grand Rapids, Michigan. -Oh, that's not even a big city is it? -No, not comparatively but for the Midwest it's still quite a good size city. When Detroit died, all the sh*t that left Detroit came to Grand Rapids. Came straight to us. Housing went up, jobs disappeared, and I was like, Why am I gonna keep paying for an apartment when I can buy an apartment? -Right. -And pretty much build what I want to inside of it. -I know this is a big ask but can we check it out? ROBERT: It's a hot mess in there isn't it? MIKE: No, it's actually not. Let me get the dogs out together. BOB: If that dog... If you go in there with that dog, you will not come out. ROBERT: Oh, stop it. [all laughing] MIKE: Let me get the dogs harnessed and out. -When I met him last year I was in a bit of a bind. I had issues with my vehicle and then I had issues with my solar, so... He helped me out with both of them and... ...he's the one that got me, like, you know, this is... Do what you can to help people out here. Because you never know when you're gonna need help. -I was told that with the first guy I met in town. He said that's the vibe out here. -Yeah. BOB: If you need help, you'll get help. People help you. I mean there's rules, you can't do certain... You can't work on your trucks out here. That's what the guy with the trailer up front, his problem was. You know, but people will try to do what they can for you. PETER: Slab City, have you guys ever heard of this place? ROBERT: Oh, yeah. -That's a totally different vibe, right? BOB: I think Slab City is, you know... You hear a lot about Slab City in\u2026 with younger people. It's like, \"Oh, did you go to Slab City?\" I went there. I camped out there last year. Nothing bad happened. It's just a... I'll give you my take on it is so there's a hot springs there. Which is great. You go in the hot springs but it's a mess. I mean it's all slimy, and the wood is all old, and you can fall into the water, and there's garbage everywhere. They have a spot over there where they just throw the garbage. -Yeah, yeah, it was pretty trashy when I went. -The flies are terrible and it's like you would think that somebody would say, \"Hey, let's get 20 guys together and clean this up...\" \"...and fix the stuff by the hot springs.\" They won't even do that. So I'm not very impressed with... It's the typical smarter than... You know, what is it? Too smart by half or whatever it is of the Libertarian, Anarchic... \"Oh, you know, we don't need a government. We don't do anything.\" I don't know if I could live there. ROBERT: He's probably long gone by now but you've got Bob Wells, of the movie, Nomad, fame. BOB: Don't promote Bob Wells. [Mike laughing] ROBERT: Of the movie Nomad, fame. I think the one that looks like Santa Clause. He will tell everybody, \"Oh, you can live out here for $600 to $800.\" BOB: In a car. ROBERT: In a car. And he convinces senior citizens to do that... ...and I don't agree with it. BOB: Mostly women. ROBERT: Because it can get very difficult out here and if you're an older person that isn't a little savvy, then it'll kill you. MIKE: It'll kill ya. BOB: So many women, older women, listen, watch this guy, and they will come out here in cars and they're... It's not for the faint of heart. It's just... you are constantly lifting, moving, grabbing, pulling, and if you want to eat you gotta start a fire or you gotta have some kind of propane, something. It's not like being at home and washing dishes at the kitchen sink. -Yeah. -You know, and it can be demanding. And so it's pretty contentious. You go out and talk to those people in the ambulances... Pam, we call her \"Pam of the Pambulance.\" She'll tell you for sure she doesn't like him sending people out here that don't have any real means to protect themselves. ROBERT: Right. -So you're saying there's a whole group of ambulance campers? -It's starting to be which I hate these trends. MIKE: It's becoming a trend. BOB: It's becoming a trend so I'm gonna have to get a bus. [all laughing] PETER: Wait, I thought busses were a trend. ROBERT: That's already a trend. BOB: I know but at least everyone has one. MIKE: This is very much military-style. PETER: Military-style, okay. MIKE: It's very Spartan. PETER: An old Army bus, yeah? MIKE: Um, I don't know what service it is. I'm a vet. -Oh you are a vet? -I'm a vet. -Do you miss the service at all or no? -I do. I do, it's... You wake up in the morning, you don't have to think about what you're gonna do for the day. You don't have to worry about not having somebody around to help if you need help. Stuff like that. -Right. -Out here you're completely on your own unless you got a good group of guys around like these guys here. -You've got that then? -Yeah. -And you love Hot Wheels? -I do. It's just a hobby. Something my dad used to get me when he would go on trips, or vacations, or out for a weekend. He would bring me back one and I just continued the hobby. [chuckles] -Okay, that's cool. PETER: Wow, it reminds me... I haven't been in a bus since I was a kid. [Mike laughs] -It\u2019s kinda short. You know, I'm a short guy. So I got the clearance but if you're a taller guy it can be a little bit of a challenge. She's a beast, she's solid. About five and a half miles to the gallon in the city, about seven and a half to nine miles on the highway. -Okay. What did you pay for it? If you don't mind me asking. -Six grand. -Six grand... 17 years ago? -No. Last year. -You upgraded? -Yeah. I had a Class C that I was in that was 30 years old and water pump failed, everything in the back broke all at the same time when I went to have it assessed. So like, that's five grand. I was like, \"Oh, sh*t.\" For that price I'm going to find something else. This was my dad who just passed in March. -Oh, I'm sorry. -So he was the one who helped me get approved on the bus. It was the last thing he'd approved for me to work on. -What do you mean he approved for you to work on the bus? -My cash limit to buy the bus. -Your what? -My cash limit to buy the bus. -Oh, okay, okay. -He backed me on that and that was his last thing he did. Like a month before he passed. -I'm sorry. -You did good job. Good girl. PETER: What is this here? What's going on here, Mike? -Somebody made this last year apparently or 2020. -Okay. -I just happened to find it and it made a good reference point for if I come back in the dark. I have a line-up site that I can come in and pull in on. -Okay. PETER: So what are people missing from the outside? ROBERT: What are they missing? PETER: What do they not get? ROBERT: They think we're homeless. BOB: They think we're insane. MIKE: Drug addled, reprobates. BOB: All our families think it's dangerous. BOB: My sister, I sent her a picture of the desert. Beautiful picture of the desert, she goes, \"Looks dangerous.\" And I'm like, \"What's dangerous? It's the desert.\" PETER: Saguaro cacti? Pretty dangerous? BOB: Yeah, they're very dangerous. PETER: If you fall into them. ROBERT: Yeah, if you fall into them. BOB: Yeah, they think it's dangerous. It's not dangerous. MIKE: This is my idea of true freedom. I mean you get to do what you want when you want. You set your own rules and as long as you got a little bit of common sense you'll be all right. PETER: What's the drug scene out here? BOB: I don't know. I don't do drugs. MIKE: Out here, mostly there's meth cookers out here. PETER: Ah. MIKE: There's not really any jobs in town, man. So... -Okay. They peddle to the tourists. -Tourists are into meth? Some of them that are. -The locals will cook the meth, the tourists will buy it. BOB: Go sit up at the Pilot. PETER: What's the Pilot? BOB: The Pilot truck stop. There's some unsavory characters up there. Wouldn't you say? PETER: They're just peddling meth over there? -No they're just... You'll get it. ROBERT: They are the truly homeless, most of them. -They are, um... Every one of 'em is wearing a fricken' duster. Old Western Duster and... -[Mike offended] Hey, man. -I'm not saying... [all laughing] ROBERT: They are an eclectic bunch. -To say the least. BOB: They're travelers. ROBERT: It's funny, they all have dogs... ...and they panhandle, and try to get your sympathy for the dog. You know, \"My dog's hungry, can you give me a couple extra dollars.\" And then you give them a couple dollars and they go buy booze. MIKE: When they leave, they dump the dogs in the desert. PETER: Do you guys feel disconnected from the country at all? Like you're in your own world out here? You're not following politics or you feel very much connected with... BOB: Well I do anyway. Like, I have a whole system of checking out things. So I'm constantly doing that anyway 'cause I just do it. I've done it for years but... It can be a dreamworld. Especially when you're traveling, traveling. It\u2019s a dreamworld. But then... Which is real? Is this real or is the \"back in the world\" real? Because it's kind of a dreamworld back in the world too. ROBERT: You can be as disconnected... You can be as disconnected as you want to out here. If you want to continue following what's going on in the real world then you got internet. You got your cell phone, you got internet, what have you, but if you truly want to be done with all of that... You can be. BOB: There's lots of delineations and echelons of quote-unquote society out here. Because you have RVers who are only here if they're snowbirds. So they're gonna go back to Ypsilanti, or Lansing, or Chicago, or Minneapolis. -Okay. -When the weather gets warm up there. Then there's people out here who are just here. We're nomads 'cause we're gonna go to Colorado in the summer or Utah. I'm gonna go back to Wisconsin or whatever. Um... And the real nomads, the schooly people mostly, lot of van-life people, they live in their vans, and they tour, and they go around, and they're in 'em 24 hours a day, and they either have YouTube channels or they have some digital work that they do. -Okay. -And they have means of support. Other people are on disability, or they're on Social Security, or whatever, and they have money. -Right. -So it's... People do it and they come down here because... So if you wanted to go to the Keys. Well, it's gonna cost you a fortune. Where as here you pay $180 at the LTVA. You've got, you know, an RV like that one... -Yeah. -So you've got a beautiful house. You can just go sit in your house all day if that's what you want. -So it's all different types of people doing this? -All different types of people. -Okay. -You see there's a nice fifth wheel over there. There's a bunch of beautiful Class A's. Which are the, you know, it's like you drive... Like, they're big busses basically. And those things are $400,000, $500,000. -Are there any socioeconomic divides? Like someone's got the Class A, they're not gonna hang with you 'cause you're in the ambulance or all that stuff goes away out here? Well, we get a little irritated with some of the trailer people because most of them bring generators and they just run their generators all day, and sit in there, and watch television. And so we get a little irritated. -Okay. -This guy in the trailer over here, he's got a CPAP machine. So he has to charge up his batteries during the day. So we give him a pass. -Okay. -But the trailer people, the snowbird people are a little... They like to gather in groups and I think they're probably people that they live with back in their other... And they all get together. -Sure. -Or they have friends and they get together, you know? If you have the resources and you have the money, who am I to say it's right or wrong? But if you have high levels of resources, and people come into this with different levels of resources. Some people have no resources, some people have some resources, and you just go with what you got. Once it hits you that you want to do this, well, you know, I said, \"I don't want to do this in my ambulance.\" \"I need to do something.\" So... and the more I looked at the ambulance sitting in the driveway I thought, \"Well, I've got the truck.\" I know it's a 7.3 diesel, it's dependable, it's a great platform. I know it's gonna run. Finally I was like... So I had to literally get rid of everything because there's no room in there for anything. But I'm telling you, everything I sold, I felt better, and better, and better, until the whole place was empty. And then I felt great. So it's just, you know, some people couldn't do it 'cause they couldn't give all that stuff up. \u266a country guitar \u266a [truck driving on gravel] PETER: It's so beautiful out here. \u266a mellow music from campsite \u266a The colors of the desert.

So little by little, I got closer and closer, you know? -Okay. You're a cyclist? -Yeah, I am. Not heavy-duty cyclist but [laughs] just a means of... This is built to get me far off-road somewhere. -Okay. -And then I have an awning and I can add walls to it and if that's the case I need another means of transportation. I have my backpack up top. -So what do you get out of this lifestyle? Like what do you feel out of it? Oh, freedom and where I need to be on this planet. Honestly, like... -Okay. -And it's just living this and giving back to whatever I can give back to... ...as a collective. -Okay. -I'm not bound to a time frame. I am not bound any of it. It's just me and the road, and me, and, you know, people... -Do you meet people out here? -Oh, I meet cool as hell people out here. -Medicine Bear. -Where's Medicine Bear? -He's in there right now. We just went on a hike earlier today. We were just over in this ridge line over here and we went on a hike and he's... Maybe he's crashed-out in there. [both laughing] -And he is legitly a medicine bear. You look at him and you're like, \"You are Medicine Bear.\" -So it's all types out here, right? -It's all types. -It's everyone? -Oh it is, and it's cool 'cause there's a thread, and that thread is just like, \"What can I do for you?\" \"What can I do to make your experience a little easier?\", you know? -Okay. -You know, everyone's within their own little section or whatever. -Okay, okay. -There's more parties in certain sections, there's more, like, you know, meditation in certain sections, but I could walk over there and, like, say hi to someone over there and... You know what I mean? -You just do that? You just walk to whomever? -Yeah. -It's almost like you're doing something independently but collectively in a way. -Yeah, yeah. -So it drops the guard. And, like, every door is open in a way. -Yeah. Like you can go talk to... -Collectively, we're tied. I had no idea this community even existed. -Where are you from originally? -Until, like, three weeks ago. -Originally from Utah. -Okay. -So do you get more community out here than in typical life, let's call it? -Yes, I do. -Okay. -I mean, maybe I've lived in a home, and I have neighbors, and it's like, am I getting into their living spaces? And, like, you know what I mean? It's just different here. -You have adult kids? -I have adult kids, yes. -What do they think of it? -They know this is me. -You look happy. You look very happy. -Well, it's like... You know what I mean?

Nice little view into Quartzsite, or Greater Quartzsite, Arizona. A few takeaways. It's got a good vibe here. All different types of people, different walks of life, different socioeconomic situations, but it seems quite respectful, and... Very interesting, gotta say. I could definitely come out here for a few weeks. Wouldn't be living, but could come out here for a bit. All right, guys, thanks for coming along on that.

That worked perfectly, that thing I just did there. Great job, Joe. Go home. Go! Joe: Now let's measure the medium. Why not? Our mediums are smaller. Huh. Interesting. So, this is a Japanese Big Mac. Ta-da! [trumpets playing] Oh! So, this is a Japanese Big Mac. Joe: This is an American Big Mac, and we're going to weigh it as well. Oh, we've got a heftier Big Mac here in the US. That's more like it. So, in Japan, the Big Mac value set, which is a Big Mac and medium fries and a medium drink, comes out to 690 yen, or $6.21. In the US, that same meal costs $8.54, or 948.46 Japanese yen. That's a 37.52% increase in price in the US. What the heck? So, here is everything you can only get at Japan's McDonald's you cannot get in the US. And this is everything you can get at a US McDonald's that you cannot get in Japan. So, we are going to start with waffle cones, right here. So, we got plain. So, plain means it's, like, rich milk taste. And next one is strawberry. Strawberry. Personally, I like this. Our next one is chocolate and almond, right there. Mm. It's not melting. Good job, buddy. So, here we've got McFloats. So, McFloats means there is soda, and on top of that, there is ice cream. That's it. That's it. And this is McFloats melon. Ooh! [laughs] It's too sweet. This is grape. Coffee McFloats. Mm. And the last one, we've got Coke McFloats. Mm. Oh, Joe, you definitely try this. Yes, absolutely. I'm trying that when I go to Japan. That looks real good. Let me think here. Hang on a second. [metal clanging] OK. We do not have McFloats here in the US, so I'm going to make my own. On the way over here, I was looking for grape soda. It's actually harder to find than I thought. Fanta's not very popular in the United States. But we got this. This is Midnight Grape Kickstart Mountain Dew. It's grape. Haha! Left over from the Ben & Jerry's shoot. This stuff is frozen. There we go. [electric zapping] Yeah. I'm into this. These would do well in the US. Our cold drinks, a little bit different. We have two exclusive slushies that you can't get in Japan. One is a pink lemonade. Strawberry watermelon. Yeah, dude. That looks real good. Yes, they do have McFlurries and ice cream in Japan, but one McFlurry you can get in the US is this one. It's an M&M's McFlurry. Sorry, it's since melted, but it's like those mini M&M's. I went to one of the few McDonald's in the country where the ice cream machine was working. Hot caramel sundae, and the classic fudge sundae. George: So, let's go with soft drinks, right here. Fanta grape, and here is Fanta melon. And this one is Japanese vegetable juice. And there is, I guess, more than 20 or 30 vegetables in it. And it's good for health, for sure. Aah. [water running] [chimes sound] Mm. We've got Qoo white grape. Sokenbicha. Sokenbicha is like a Japanese blended tea. It's healthy. And Japanese people drink this on a daily basis. So, next one, we've got Earl Grey iced tea. Let me show you. Wait, there is something. [beep] There's a mosquito. I have to make a complaint, Japan McDonald's! Next one, we've got oolong tea. So, this is not actually Japanese tea. It's a Chinese tea that's good for health as well. For health, we do have a mango pineapple smoothie and a banana strawberry smoothie. Smoothies have fruit in it, right? Oh, yeah. I can just feel the nutrients coursing through my veins! So, let's start with this Hawaiian menu. This is limited. This one right here is Cheese Loco Moco. Ooh, it's messy. It's a demi-glace sauce. Man. And it's also got round egg, right there, beef patty, and some cheese. I'm hungry, actually. Mm! Oh, this is good! Oh! [laughs] This is [speaks Japanese], which means really, really delicious. All right, so, next one, we've got garlic shrimp, and it's also got interesting bun. There is sesame on there. And deep-fried shrimp. Hawaiian barbecue potato and beef. Demi-glace sauce again. It's gonna be good. This is called barbecue burger, right? But I don't taste barbecue at all. All right, so, next one, we've got Hawaiian pancake with triple berry sauce. Two pancakes. Hello! Mm, smells so sweet. Ooh. Let's go. Ooh. Too sweet. McFizz blue Hawaii. Wow. It has bright blue color. This is McFizz cassis and orange. I would get this. I would get this. So, congratulations, this is the worst. OK. Breakfast time. This is a breakfast burrito. Ugh. Neon-yellow egg, Mexican-style salsa. Not to be confused with, what, Canadian salsa? This is actually the same burrito from the US-UK thing we shot over a year ago. So. Let's go on to these breakfast sandwiches here. Japan does have the McGriddles, which are a favorite of mine, so unfortunately we will not be talking about those today. Sad face. I love you, McGriddles. So, what they don't have, and also the UK did not have, were our breakfast biscuit sandwiches. I don't know how to describe a biscuit, other than it's dry, it's baked. Maybe they're made with cornmeal? According to the internet, this is not a scone, so there you go. Sausage, egg, and cheese. Our egg is like this fluffy, folded scrambled-egg egg. So theirs are, like, sunny-side up? Ours are scrambled. I can tell this was folded over. You can see the fold lines there. This is how we do it in the US. Bacon, egg, and cheese. Is there a better breakfast combination in the world? I don't think there is. Then they just have a sausage, no egg, no cheese, just sausage and biscuit. We have regular-sized hotcakes, and we have a hotcake-and-sausage combo. And, of course, comes with syrup and butter. Very natural pose. Very natural feeling right now. \u266a Always up for a pour, yes! \u266a Breakfast is served. Oatmeal. On the side, to be mixed in, cranberries and raisins and diced -- oh! Diced apples. [slurps] And here we've got Mega Muffin. Pork patties. That's huge one. Mini pancakes. Oh, cute. It comes with apple cream sauce. Ooh. Ooh, this is perfect for breakfast. I would get it. Bacon egg McSandwich. So, it's got bacon and round egg and cheddar cheese. That's it. And you might be surprised, we've got Filet-O-Fish. Ta-da! So, Filet-O-Fish is on the breakfast menu. I guess Japanese people tend to eat fish for breakfast. Three exclusive burgers here in the US are variations on the Quarter Pounder with cheese. Yes, we've all seen \"Pulp Fiction,\" we know about the whole Quarter Pounder thing. Does not exist outside of the US, I don't think. So, probably why they don't have Quarter Pounders in Japan. The classic Quarter Pounder with cheese. Look at this guy. I mean, this was maybe my go-to one for a decade. The Quarter Pounder with cheese deluxe. I don't know. I feel like this is pretty close to a Whopper. I'm not a big Whopper guy, but there you go, a deluxe Quarter Pounder with cheese. The double Quarter Pounder with cheese. Look at the size of this thing! Yes, sir. Japan's exclusive burgers. Teriyaki McBurger, which is my most favorite one. My body is made of McTeriyaki burger. [angelic singing] So, it's got mayo right there, and lettuce, pork patties, dip it into delicious teriyaki sauce, and it's covering whole pork patties perfectly. Joe, when you come to Japan, please try this. You will thank me later. Everything that they have looks so good and sounds so good. Man, when I go to Tokyo, first stop, I'm going to McDonald's. Sushi, ramen, get it out of my face. I want the teriyaki burger. That's the first thing I'm getting when I get there. Mm! I'm getting full, actually. [laughs] Slow down, George. We got a lot of food to cover. [dance music] All right, so we've got bacon lettuce burger right here. It looks sad. Egg cheeseburger, but we also call it Eguchi. Eguchi is an abbreviation for egg cheeseburger. Japanese people love abbreviation. It's got ketchup and pickle, round egg, and cheddar cheese and beef patties. Next one. Spicy beef burger. Ooh, look at this! Oh, it looks so spicy! It has spicy mayo or something like that. So, here we've got Samurai Mac. Samurai! Samurai Mac? Yo, that sounds awesome. And this blue one is called roasted soy sauce double thick beef. We've got roasted soy sauce bacon tomato thick beef. So if you want a little bit more, like, healthy veggies, go for it. Uh, yeah, George, I don't know if that makes that much healthier there 'cause it also has twice as much meat and cheese. If you're looking to be healthy at a McDonald's in Japan, I'd stick with the vegetable juice. And this one right here is called Teriyaki chicken Filet-O. Wow. So much sauce. So, next one, we've got ebi Filet-O. Ebi means shrimp, so it's a shrimp Filet-O. Oh, yeah. It's got aurora sauce. Aurora sauce is like ketchup and mayonnaise. So, it's got a lot of shrimp in there. Mm! So good. So good. In the US, we have about four exclusive chicken sandwiches specifically. I didn't see this on the menu, but apparently you guys don't have a McChicken, which is just chicken sandwich. Regular bun, mayo, chicken. Yeah. We also have, check this out, spicy McChicken. So pretty much the same McChicken, but they put spicy coating on the breading on the chicken. Every fast-food chain in America right now is having what we're calling the fried-chicken-sandwich wars. Popeyes, Burger King, of course McDonald's, all of them are at this arms race to have the best chicken sandwich. I think 'cause Chick-fil-A has edged everyone out. These are the three that are currently available. I don't know for how long. You have the crispy chicken sandwich. I think it's a brioche bun, pickles, and no sauce, which I think is strange. So, like, the whole flavor is just the chicken. Spicy chicken sandwich. Same deal, but, of course, spicy sauce. And the spicy chicken deluxe, which, to George's point, has more vegetables on it. You know, to be healthier. OK, so when it comes to side menus, we've got Shaka Shaka Chicken, and we have two fla -- [thunder rumbles] oh! Two flavors. Can you hear that? Thunder, thunder, thunder! 'Cause it's rainy season in Japan. It's the sunny season here in Southern California. And here is red pepper. And this one is cheddar cheese. [thundering] Thunder, stop! So, all you have to do is just put the powder into the bag and shake it. [paper rattling] And the powder should be covering the whole Shaka Chicken. [thundering] Ooh, big one! Like this. This I've seen before. This I want. That's the thing I want the most at a Japanese McDonald's. US McDonald's, we have the bags, we have the chicken. Just get the spice packets. Throw it in. George: We've got side salad, and it comes with this roasted sesame dressing. Let's go! Ooh. That was cool. Now put it all in the garbage. We've got edamame and corn. Yogurt, and there's cow, cow. Exclusive sauces. It's sauce talk time. Sauce Talk. We have sweet 'n sour sauce. They gave me hot mustard. This was supposed to be honey mustard. You guys have hot mustard? I know you don't have honey mustard. Of course, ranch. Ooh, spicy Buffalo. Now, these might be promotions 'cause of that singing group BTS, but we have right now a Cajun sauce and a sweet chili sauce. This sauce is fantastic. This is the sauce. This has to stay on the menu. So, these two are new ones. This one right here is soy sauce, best sauce. Man. This is fantastic! Good job! Very good taste. So, this one right here is called Louisiana hot sauce. Ooh, it does look like very spicy one. This is not spicy at all. Actually, we were supposed to have bai burger options, but unfortunately you can only get them from 5:30 p.m. But let me explain what bai burger is. Bai simply means double in Japanese. So if you order a normal Big Mac, it has two beef patties, right? But if you order bai Big Mac, it has four beef patties. But not only Big Mac, but all burgers adopts the bai burger options. That's funny. You can only get double the meat after 5:30, that's really funny. That would not stand in this country at all. People would lose their minds. Four patties? On a Big Mac? So after shooting this video, I'm going to order bai Big Mac. And then bye-bye, health. You ain't gotta tell me, George! Bye, health! All right, here are all the ingredients for a US Big Mac. Oh, God. The bun. It has: enriched flour, which is wheat flour, [fast-forwarding] vinegar, and contains wheat. On to the beef patty. 100% pure USDA inspected beef, no fillers, no extenders! Prepared on the grill with seasoning, salt and black pepper. There you go. There you go. Try the lettuce ingredients, lettuce. Nice. The Big Mac sauce ingredients. Soybean oil, [fast-forwarding] extractives of paprika, soy lecithin. [burps] The pickle slice ingredients. Cucumbers, water, distilled vinegar, salt, calcium chloride, alum, potassium sorbate as a preservative, natural flavors, polysorbate 80, extractives of turmeric for color. Onion ingredients. Onions. There you go. A few things I want to note. Alum is used to dissolve steel. Polysorbate 80 has been linked to colon cancer in mice. Cue the dancing mice. [dance music] And caramel color is on California's list of chemicals that may cause cancer and reproductive toxicity, good God. Counterpoint. They all taste fantastic. So, McDonald's Japan doesn't disclose their ingredients in the Big Mac. However, they do tell us where the ingredients come from. If you order a Big Mac in Japan, you'll eat beef from Australia or New Zealand; buns made from wheat imported from the USA, Canada, and Australia; and pickles made from cucumbers grown in Turkey, Sri Lanka, or India; onions grown in the USA or India; sliced cheddar cheese made in New Zealand, Australia, the USA, or Japan; and lettuce grown in Japan, Taiwan, the USA, or Malaysia. The only ingredients that come from Japan are the cheese and the lettuce. And even then, McDonald's still imports some lettuce and cheese from other countries. So this is a very international burger. Thank you, world! In Japan, our Big Mac is 525 calories and 28.3 grams of fat and 1,007 milligrams of sodium and 41.8 grams of carbs and 26 grams of protein. In the US, our Big Mac is 550 calories, 30 grams of fat, 1,010 milligrams of sodium, 45 grams of carbs, and 25 grams of protein. So the US has a slight increase on everything except protein. So, in Japan, our five-piece nuggets is 270 calories and 17.2 grams of fat and 506 milligrams of sodium and 13.1 grams of carbs and 15.8 grams of protein. Broken down, each nugget is 54 calories. We don't have a five-piece here in the US, but we do have this, a 10-piece. Let's get those stats on the screen. Go ahead and divide everything by two, and, yes, now we have the stats for a five-piece. Pretty smart, eh? If we want to divide all that by, I think, five, you'll get the stats for one nugget. [sighs] This is so exhausting. In Japan, if you order a Big Mac meal with large fries and a medium chocolate shake, the grand total will be 1,405 calories. And in the US, adding medium fries and a medium chocolate shake to a Big Mac, the grand total is 1,660 calories. And that is a calorie increase of 18.14%. If you're wondering why we're using a large fry but a medium chocolate shake, it turns out that in Japan, you can't get a large chocolate shake. They'll only sell it to you in medium. I'm assuming because they don't want you eating that much ice cream. George: From calorie count to portion sizes, we wanted to find out all the differences between KFC in Japan and the US. This is \"Food Wars.\" So, the fries at the KFC in Japan come in three sizes. So this is small. George: Next one is Joe: And back again! George: Large. Joe: The large. Then we got a box. Now let's weigh our largest fries. Ooh, ooh, ooh! [Joe laughs] George: We can do it! I'm shook! As the kids say. By that information. I want to say, though, that theirs is a box. That thing is, like, made to be eaten by more than one person, I'm assuming. But this, clearly, this is for a person. So. So, in Japan, we have three drink sizes. So we have a small. In the US, our drinks come in medium. George: A medium. Then we got a large. And large. So, in Japan, KFC doesn't disclose how much liquid is in each of the sizes. Why? So I will help you, KFC. We will measure the cups right now. Let's go. So now let's measure our large, and just to make sure it's accurate, we didn't clean the measuring cup. Go home. So, at the KFC in Japan, you can order your chicken pieces in one piece, two pieces, three pieces, four pieces, and six pieces, and eight pieces, and 10 pieces, and 12 pieces. KFC in the US, our chicken portion sizes start as a two-piece combo. By the way, come on, guys. This isn't whatever this is supposed to be. Then the three-piece right in front of me here. And that's the exact opposite. I went extra crispy for this. Look at the size of these chicken pieces! Yes, yes to these. And the four-piece. This is somewhere in the middle. Each combo comes with a biscuit, your choice of potato, either fries or mashed with gravy, and all of them come with a medium drink. But we don't stop there. We go now to buckets, where you can get an eight-piece bucket, 12-piece bucket, or a 16-piece bucket. So, now we are going to weigh our eight-piece chicken to compare the weights in each country. Joe: Ooh, ooh, oh! Oh, this is the \u2014 ugh! Yo! It's pretty close! Considering all the variables of size of chicken, bone density, batter. I don't know what I'm talking about, but that's surprisingly close. So, in Japan, a two-piece of original chicken, which are breasts and wing and small fries and a medium drink, costs 800 yen, or $7.27. So, in Japan, actually KFC is considered a little bit more expensive compared to other fast-food chains, like McDonald's. So it's a classic fast food in Japan. That same meal is about $8.99, or in Japanese yen, 992.27. So that's about a 24% cost increase in the US. So, in Japan, to make chicken at KFC, you must be certified as a chicken specialist, and certification takes three months, and your knowledge and skills are tested every year. All right, so let's take the chicken-specialist test right now. All right, George, let's do this. No. 1. \"For the original chicken, 100% domestic ... \" That's kind of a bummer. Hmm. I'm just gonna \u2014 yeah. Ba ba de ba ba ba. Animal fat or vegetable oil ... Fried with a lighter weight. With a lighter weight than \u2014 these got hard fast. Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep ... I am in over my head on this one. I don't even know what that means. All right, so just now I've got all of the five answers, so let's check answers. Gold chicken certification. Gold! [applause] Oof! Says \"Not KFC material,\" and it's a picture of Colonel Sanders giving me the finger. So I'm gonna assume I did not pass it. But anyway, I've got gold. I'm the champion! I am very surprised by that. I think I could work for KFC. I mean, I kind of look like Colonel Sanders, right? Look at this guy. I'm a younger Colonel Sanders. KFC is doing any sort of \"The Adventures of Young Colonel Sanders\" ad campaign. Is this a face that can sell chicken? Yeah! Haven't you guys ever read the secret? I'm putting the energy that I want out into the universe, and it comes back to me. Conner: Manifesting. It's called manifesting. So, here is everything you can only find on the menu at the KFC in Japan, but not in the US. And here is everything you can find on the menu at a US KFC you cannot get in Japan. Here, we've got KFC biscuits. Both places have biscuits, but their biscuit has a hole in it. And it looks a lot fluffier. Right? Our biscuit, on the other hand, is just this Southern style. Not exactly a scone, but kind of looks like one from a distance. Dry cornmeal biscuit. It comes with honey maple KFC. George: Ahh. Joe: Oh, ho ho ho ho! Yeah. This is good. The maple is a little bit sweet for me. Mac and cheese. I can't believe you guys do not have macaroni and cheese. Mwah. Love mac and cheese. Mashed potatoes and gravy. You don't have that in Japan? Guys. Guys! Demand this from your Japanese KFC. You want the mashed potatoes and gravy. So, we also have dip packs. Ooh. So, it's got Colonel Crispy, and some nuggets, and boneless Kentucky, and some original chicken. So this dip pack, it comes with this fries and also these three dipping sauces. And now for the quickest Sauce Talk ever. Sauce Talk. KFC sauce. I think the KFC sauce is like a brown mustard mayo. Yeah, that sauce is good. So, we've got barbecue sauce and mustard, and this pink one is called mentaiko mayo. Mentaiko means it's spicy cod roe, and it's very popular at KFC in Japan. This is actually great. I'll dip this. Mm! It tastes fantastic. Winner! So, if you want to have a little bigger one, you can order dip barrel. I mean, it's double amount of this dip pack, so it's going to be very big. So, this one right here is called four-piece red hot chicken box, and it comes with a pie and fry, and a medium drink. And actually we have other box options, like four-piece half hot and half original box. And it comes with fries as well. And six-piece half hot and half original box. It comes with fries again. So, in Japan, we have tori no hi pack. That means chicken day. It's on every 28th of the month. And two stands for ni, and eight stands for wa. And it becomes niwa, and niwa is synonmous with niwatori. Niwatori means chicken. So that's why it's called chicken day. KFC in America has extra-crispy chicken. This is the best type of chicken. I mean, look at this. I don't know what they do to this, but the skin is practically falling off. It is so crispy and so delicious. I love extra crispy so much. I got this little guy. The Chicken Little. Look at this guy. Eh? Look at this little guy. Comes with pickles, mayo. The pot pie that they have here, they're not kidding when they say \"pie\" in the pot pie. Look how thick this is! Speaking of big dishes of stuff, the Famous Bowl. Once upon a time, a KFC employee was like, I'm gonna put everything into one dish and call it a day. And ta-da, the Famous Bowl was born. This has to be, like, 3 pounds. All right, so here we've got two special twisters. So this one right here is called pepper mayonnaise twister. Ooh! It looks great. [applause] 9 out of 10. KFC, thank you! Thank you for making me happy. So, next, we've got, ooh! Teriyaki twister. Should be great. It's kind of gross. [laughs] It's got mayo and Colonel Crispy, some veggies, and I hope this is teriyaki sauce. Itadakimasu! Mm. Mm! Mm! It looks gross, but it tastes incredible. 10 out of 10. Congratulations. Oishii! It means delicious! Look how tiny those twisters are. I could eat, like, three of those easily. Easily! All right, so we have nuggets. We have three pieces, five pieces, and they come with only ketchup. Also at a US KFC that you can't get in Japan are wings. You can get wings at the KFC in units of six, 12, 24 or 48. I believe the three wing flavors that I got here are standard Buffalo, the honey barbecue, and if you're a total wuss, unsauced? What's wrong with you? Yeah. Very sketchy. You can also get them, in a limited time, Nashville hot sauce. Now we have special sandwiches. This one right here is called Japanese-style chicken katsu sandwich. So let's take a look inside. So, it's got mayo, and it's got cabbage, and chicken katsu right there. Itadakimasu! Mm. Oh! This sauce is soy-sauce-based sauce, and it's a little bit sweet. And this mayo is also great with this sauce. This looks really small, but it has huge amount of chicken. So if you eat this, you're gonna be full. And next one, we've got chicken fillet. Wow. This is also huge. All right, so this one right here is called black hot sandwich. Ooh! Look at this. It's, like, pepper mayo? I just tasted this pepper mayo, but it has a little, like, spiciness. Ooh, ho ho. Oh, man. It's too strong. I wouldn't get it. Be careful. Now, of course, the US has a chicken sandwich. But our chicken sandwich and their chicken sandwich, as you can see, is way different. You can also get it spicy or classic. This is a classic. All right, so this one right here is called Colonel Crispy. Is it only in Japan? I cannot confirm the difference between a Colonel Crispy and a KFC chicken tender. They call their tenders Colonel Crispies, and we call our Colonel Crispies chicken tenders. It's been a while since I ordered this one, but it still has crispy bits. Good job. Japanese KFC's technology, state of the art. We currently have a Nashville hot chicken and hot tenders. I went ahead with the tenders. I've just been informed this was a big TikTok thing for a minute. Something about biting it and crunching it. I don't know anything about that. I can say just by holding this, there's no way these are crispy. [crunching] Was not that spicy. That's kind of spicy. I do like this a lot. I can't stop eating it. Ooh. That heat's catching up with me. Slow burn. Slow build on the heat. So, here we've got Japanese exclusive drinks. This one right here is water, but it comes with this Assam tea pack. It's supposed to be hot, but it's cold. And next one, we've got coffee. So, this one right here is roasted rich coffee. Itadakimasu. It's a little bit better than the normal coffee. And here we've got Earl Grey iced tea. It's not sweet at all. And next one is melon soda. It has bright green color. Horrible. It's too sweet. Here is ginger ale. Nothing special. And the last one, it's Nacchan refreshing orange. Fountain drinks. There's a few that we can get that you guys cannot over there in Japan. The first one is a beverage that I have yet to meet one human being who enjoys it. Of course, I'm talking about Sierra Mist. Maybe grossest soda ever. Oh, it's so bad. Another drink that you can get at KFC that you can't get at Japan, and here it is right here, Mountain Dew's great. When I was in college, I worked at a pizza place. I drank so much Mountain Dew, I threw up. And now I'm drinking Mountain Dew. Let's see if I can do it again. My favorite beverage, Mountain Dew Sweet Lightning. So good. So good. So, drinks are just normal, nothing special, but chickens are finger-licking good. Desserts at a US KFC, you can get this chocolate chip cookie. Recognize that guy? I just look just like this guy. And, finally, a chocolate chip cake. So, let's talk about Christmas in Japan. So Christmas is one of the biggest events in Japan, even though about 1% of Japanese people are Christians. We just enter Christmas as just a fun event. And as for KFC for Christmas in Japan, back in 1970s, Japan KFC launched a hugely successful advertising campaign called Kentakki ni wa Kurisumasu. That's Kentucky for Christmas. And with that strong marketing campaign, it became so popular to have KFC for Christmas in Japan. And now about 3.6 million Japanese families eat KFC for Christmas. And talking about my personal experiences, yes, when I was young, I would eat KFC for Christmas with my family. But when you started dating, you know, Christmas makes the transformation from a family event to couple's event. And I'm looking for the one who can enjoy KFC for Christmas with me. So, in Japan, one drumstick of ori \u2014 ooh! So, in Japan, one drumstick of original chicken, on average, has 237 calories. Chicken's looking a little limp there, George. In the US, one stiff drumstick of original recipe is 130 calories. But according to KFC's US site, that's for a 53-gram piece. Now, adjusting for the 87-gram piece, like that of Japan, the calories go up to 210. Does that make sense? Great. Now, take this bad boy and make him extra crispy? You got 270 calories. So, in Japan, a two-piece of original chickens and a small fry and a medium drink is roughly 717 calories. A US two-piece, individual fry, and medium drink comes out to be 990 calories. So a lot more. It's too many calories. Mm. Not enough calories, if you ask me. But finger-licking good. I think KFC got to George. He keeps dropping that slogan. Are they paying George? I think George is getting some money on the side from KFC. Oh, my God. If George turns out to be Colonel Sanders, I will lose my mind. So, KFC in Japan doesn't disclose their ingredients. So we emailed their customer support, and this is what they told us. And in the US, our original-recipe chicken ingredients are: first, with the fresh chicken, it is marinated with salt, sodium phosphate, and monosodium glutamate. On to the breading, it's breaded with wheat flour, tricalcium phosphate, maltodextrin, triglycerides, natural flavor, Colonel's secret original recipe seasoning. They also said our fries are made of potatoes, obviously, and vegetable oil and fat. The batter is made of rice flour, vegetable starch, and dextrose. And our fries, which contain sea salt, monosodium glutamate, tricalcium phosphate, hydrolyzed soy protein, potassium chloride, potatoes, that's good, degermed yellow cornmeal, disodium dihydrogen pyrophosphate, to maintain natural color. What's more natural than disodium dihydrogen pyrophosphate? Rolls off the tongue. And one thing I have to say is that our fries are imported from both America and Belgium. And some of the Belgian fries are made with potatoes from France. So our fries are truly, truly French. Bonjour! In the US, we have four chicken shapes. In Japan, we have five chicken shapes. Let me explain. So, we have this one. It's called kiru. Kiru is like chicken's breast, right here. [laughing] I'm gonna say chicken's chest. Breasts ... [laughing] Kiru is like chicken's chest, right there. The first one is the breast. This is the big piece of chicken your dad gets. And also we got wing. It's a, as you know, chicken wing. This is supposed to be a wing. This is laughably small. And we've got this one. It's called rib. Chickens have ribs? So, rib is, like, under the chest, right here. And we got this one, thigh. Thigh is, like, chicken's lower back. And the next piece is this, which I think is the thigh. And, of course, the next piece, everyone knows the drum. And this is a chicken's leg. Joe: From calorie count to portion sizes, we wanted to find out all the differences between Starbucks in Japan and the US. This is \"Food Wars.\" In Japan, our hot coffee comes in four sizes. Short. Short. Tall. Tall. Grande. The grande. And venti. And, of course, the venti. Mm! Starbucks episode. I'm taking a sip of everything. In Japan, our iced coffee comes in four sizes. Short. So, we start with the tall. Tall. Too good. And ... Grande. Grande, mm. And venti. Now, when we get to the iced venti size, it gets a little bit different. So, our iced venti ain't 20; it's 24 ounces. And then we have a bigger size, the trenta, which is 30 fluid ounces. For your iced-coffee aficionados who also hate your bladder, this is the one for you. So, in Japan, we have this handy coffee traveler. It's 12 cups of coffee. So you just take this off and set the cup right here. Itadakimasu! Muy bien! [sighs] I'm disappointed. Because our coffee traveler box is this. It's 96 fluid ounces. So this peels off, which is nice. Theirs is funner than ours. I like that one. Like, this is like ... [cardboard scraping] We got this boring box. Look at this. Ugh! It's like a caveman. So, here is everything you can only find on the menu at Starbucks in Japan. And here is everything you can get at a US Starbucks you cannot get in Japan. Holy [beep]. A bit of clarification: We know that Starbucks will customize drink orders, and there's thousands of variations of special secret menu items. Plus, now, thanks to TikTok, there are endless new drinks. So these are things on the official Starbucks menu in Japan and the US. So, Japan Starbucks updates their menu very often. So by the time this video is released, they might not be available. Gomenasai. Sorry. This one is called Go peach Frappuccino. Mm! I really love peach, and this is good. 7 out of 10. Nice! Go pineapple Frappuccino. Pink frozen lemonade and passion tea. It's a little bit sour. Yuzu citrus and tea. It's the worst. What happened to you? 1 out of 10. Hojicha classic latte. So, hojicha is roasted Japanese green tea that originated in Kyoto 100 years ago. This is good! Fantastic! I'll give this 9 out of 10. Chai chocolate Frappuccino. What? [laughs] Too sweet! Espresso affogato. So, affogato is the process of pouring espresso shot onto ice cream. [in Japanese] Mixing, mixing. Clip: I don't know about y'all, but this s--- -- [gags] Again, it's too sweet. We've got dark mocha chip cream. I'm so sorry. I spilled most of it. The last one, we've got mango passion tea. And as you can imagine, this has strong mango taste. [clapboard snaps] Ugh! I feel like I'm hitting a wall here, guys. And you know what would help that? The US does not have as many exclusives as they do in Japan, at least not as frequently, but at the time of the shooting this, it is the fall. And you know what that means, Starbucks USA fans. Pumpkin spice latte. Every fall, the entire country loses their mind, and they go buy pumpkins, and they get themselves this, which is pretty much a latte that tastes like pumpkin pie. And as basic as it is, it is pretty good. Starbucks has decided to introduce a new fall beverage to their lineup, and that is this: the apple crisp macchiato. Let's check it out. What is this? Oh, man, that's terrible! What's wrong with you guys? You thought this could compete with the pumpkin spice latte? Not at all. [echoing] Does it sound like I'm, like, losing my mind? 'Cause I'm, like, really keyed up right now. I'm going to do my best to pretend like I'm not unhinged. Starbucks in the US, is this -- [laughs] Moving on. Flat white. What is a flat white? This is a flat white. \u266a Frappuccinos! \u266a Strawberry funnel cake Frappuccino. [sighs] That is really sweet. Whoo! On a scale of 1 to 10, that gets, like, 10 yos! Joe's yos. That's how I'm rating them. I cannot imagine any time of the day wanting that. A WTMOC. What is that? Eight yos. Chai creme. Oh, God, come on. The caramel ribbon crunch. Yeah, it's still really bad. Java chip Frappuccino. Nope! Last one. Thank you, God! Double chocolaty chip creme Frappuccino. Shh! That's not nearly as chocolaty as the other one. That's, like, less chocolaty, and there's \"double\" in the title. And we also got limited tea. This one is called Youthberry. So, Youthberry is citrus white tea, featuring mango, pineapple, and acai. Wow! So it should be healthy. And next one, we have roasted green tea. We drink this on a daily basis with breakfast, lunch, dinner, anytime you want. It's our go-to drink. Also in the US, you can get iced black teas. Can't get those in Japan. I don't know why. You can get these varieties. An iced royal English breakfast tea latte. Tea sucks, so I have very low expectations for this. Expectations met! The next one you have here is an iced London fog tea. I don't know what makes it foggy. I don't know. And you can also get an iced matcha lemonade. Other iced black teas I could not get my hands on is the iced guava black tea and the iced peach green tea. Ooh, I bet that peach one's pretty good. Cold brews and nitro cold brews. You can get yourself a nitro cold brew right here, and also a salted caramel cream cold brew. Vanilla sweet cream cold brew. When I said I was taking a sip of every one, I'm taking a sip of every one. I'm, like, caffeine drunk. I bet that was good four hours ago. You can get yourself an iced shaken espresso, is that what it says? [meter busts] [dance music] [echoing] Does it sound like I'm, like, losing my mind? All right. The honey almond milk flat white. So terrible. It tastes plasticky. Ta-da! So, here is Starbucks Origami. Starbucks Origami is one-cup drip-coffee system. So, it's got six origamis. And this is what it looks like. You unfold it like this. So, you just put this over a cup, and let's add some hot water. Easy-peasy, Japanese-y. And Starbucks coffee is served. Refreshers! \u266a Refreshers! \u266a What are Refreshers, you ask? I'm not quite sure. They look like juice. Oh, there's, like, stuff floating in these! Fruit and stuff. Kiwi starfish. No, starfruit. That would be weird if there were starfish in this. These were a good idea. Good call, Starbucks. Ooh, mango dragon fruit. Here we go. Mm! Blended strawberry lemonade. Very good. And this was the strawberry acai lemonade Refresher. Not as good. Iced pineapple matcha. I don't want this at all. [laughs] [whimpers] Mm-mm. So, here is all the food you can only get at Starbucks in Japan. So many! Here's the exclusive food you can get in the US you can't get in Japan. Breakfast sandwiches, I'm going in. Turkey bacon sandwich. Double-smoked bacon, cheddar, and egg, I think? Yes. Impossible breakfast sandwich. Sausage, egg, and cheese. Classic spinach feta wrap. Oh, yeah. This is the bacon Gouda sandwich. You can get yourself an avocado spread. These little guys are egg bites. Bacon and Gruy\u00e8re. Egg white, roasted red pepper. Also, these, that I bet are not any good. The kale and portobello mushroom egg bites. No, thanks! Now moving on to bagels. So, what they were able to give me was cinnamon raisin. Plain bagel. You can also get cheese, onion, and garlic bagels, everything bagels, and sprouted grain bagels. And, of course, they come with a cream cheese spread. So, I've got this shrimp avocado salad wrap. Konsai chicken salad wrap. So it's a root vegetable chicken salad wrap. Pepper, ham, and onion focaccia. So it's a pepper, ham, and onion focaccia. They've got Caesar chicken focaccia. Grilled vegetable and soybeans hambagu. Hambagu is like hamburger beef patty. Nice combination! I didn't expect that. So, let's go to the next one. Egg sandwiches. Pork patty and English muffin. Egg and ham sandwich. Ooh! Sandwich. It's got chicken, tomato sauce. Smells nice. And next one! Ooh! Big sausage. [laughs] We got the crispy grilled cheese. Should I even open it? It's just grilled cheese, right? Bread and cheese, you get it. The tomato mozzarella panini. Turkey pesto sandwich. [drumroll] Are we happy I did that? Ham and Swiss panini. Oh, the chicken caprese panini. Yeah! Now we're talking! Yeah. That's right. Got the Italian flag in one sandwich right there. This one is the chicken bacon panini. Let's open it up! Whoa! You can also get yourself protein boxes. There's a bunch of them. The one I went to didn't have any. You can also get a chicken and quinoa protein bowl. So, here we've got baked goods. All right, so let's start with this one. It's a biscuit. We've got this waffle, which really looks great. This cute strawberry cake pop. It's just like art! Red bean paste and butter. Red bean is really popular in Japan. I know it's kind of strange, but when you come to Japan, please try this. All right, next one! We've got this matcha cake, which looks very beautiful. It makes me want to post this on Instagram. Lemon cake, also looks great. This chocolate scone and tea scone. Are you going to put Harry's face on this? Hello, Harry! And next one, we've got baked cheese tart. This is so cute. Look how small it is. Cake pops? Yeah, their cake pops are big. Ours are tiny. Double chocolate brownie. Chocolate chip cookie. And although they're pretty popular, they were out when we went in. You can get yourself a marshmallow Dream Bar. Croissants. \u266a Croissants! \u266a Almond croissant. Butter croissant. Here we go. Chocolate croissant. Ham and Swiss croissant. Loaves and cakes! Banana nut loaf. This is the pumpkin loaf. Cinnamon coffee cake. So, we've got the iced lemon loaf. Cheese Danish. Blueberry muffin. And, of course, blueberry scone. Can we get Harry's face on that? So, here we've got packaged foods. So, this one is avocado cream cheese tortilla chips. I will definitely get this with beer. Not coffee. I need beer. Let's go to the next one! In Japanese, we say \"bamkuhen.\" But this is German, right? Baumkuchen? Baumkuchen? Danke schoen! But I'm curious, this matcha baumkuchen. Mm! Ooh! It has really strong matcha flavor. I love this. Wow. Thank you for coming into my life! Chocolate and nut protein bar. And this one is cheese and fruits protein bar. If you take a bite, you're gonna be ... ah! So, we've got this yogurt and banana granola. This one right here is berry yogurt and berry granola. [granola rustling] What do we got here? They got their barbecue chips. Hippeas organic chickpeas. Popcorn. [crashes] Yes. Organic fruit puree. Just eat the fruit that grew on the tree. You gotta put it in plastic first? Almonds. Ooh, chocolate-covered espresso beans! Biscottis! Madeleines. And sweet potato chips. If that wasn't enough, you can also get prepackaged shortbread cookies, dark chocolate grahams, Rip Van Wafels, and Justin's dark chocolate peanut butter cups. Sorry, Justin. They weren't there. So, here we've got this dessert section. It all looks great, right? Let's start with this Oreo cookie cake. Cinnamon bun. Chocolate doughnut. Oreo cookie doughnut with this white chocolate. Glazed doughnut. It's so sticky. We've got this tiramisu. Peach tart. And this one is lemon tart. They've got this banana cake. And next one, cheesecake. All right. So, last one, they've got strawberry tart, which looks very great, but I don't have sweet tooth, so I'm going to give all of this to my friends. In Japan, a venti latte with nonfat milk is 205 calories, 0.6 grams of fat, 30.2 grams of carbs, 20.6 grams of protein, 280 milligrams of sodium, and 225 milligrams of caffeine. In the US, the same venti caf\u00e9 latte contains 170 calories, 0.4 grams of fat, 25 grams of carbs, 16 grams of protein, 190 milligrams of sodium, and 115 milligrams of that sweet, sweet caffeine! Aah! Our venti mocha has 541 calories. Too much! Our venti mocha has 450 calories. Ah, yes. Venti mocha. Adult hot chocolate. This is a venti caramel Frappuccino. In Japan, ours has 487 calories. It looks really bad, so I'm going to put whipped cream. Ah! [laughs] Ooh! Itadakimasu! Ah! Hey, George, your whipped cream's looking a little wimpy there, buddy. You gotta do it how we do it in the USA. Check this out. Boom! Take that, environment. In the US, ours has less calories, only 470. I brought reusable straws. I don't get it. This is so bad. What about the cost? This venti Frappuccino is 627 yen, or $5.69. Can you put the price down, please? In the US, a caramel Frappuccino is $5.45, which is around 600 Japanese yen. It's kind of close, but you must consider that a US venti is 4 fluid ounces bigger. So let's do that math. Looks like it's a bit cheaper in the US. So, here is my favorite Frappuccino. This is called matcha Frappuccino. Do you have this in the US? Yes, George, we do in fact have the matcha Frappuccino here in the US, too. I don't recall putting that in the script, so I think you pulled a fast one and got us to buy you a Frappuccino, so, enjoy. Itadakimasu! [laughs] This is delicious. Excelente! Japan Starbucks doesn't disclose their ingredients, so we emailed their customer support. But, as of today, they haven't gotten back to us. What are you doing, Starbucks? You know, just respond to George! So, here is what we do know: Our cappuccino is made of espresso, steamed milk, and foamed milk. In the US, our cappuccino is made up of milk and brewed espresso. Not a lot of info in this section, gonna be honest with you. It's not a lot. We don't appreciate being left on read, Starbucks. Our caramel Frappuccino is made of blended ice with milk, whipped cream, real caramel, and espresso. Ugh! It tastes the way perfume smells, you know? In the US, our caramel Frappuccino is made up of ice, milk, carrageenan? I don't know. Vanilla syrup, coffee, obviously, and the caramel syrup is made up of sugar, water, natural flavor, citric acid, pota, potassium, potassium sorbate, salt, mono- and diglycerides, soy lecithin, and sulfites. A Japanese caramel macchiato contains vanilla syrup, milk, espresso, and original caramel sauce. And ours in the US contains milk, brewed espresso, vanilla syrup, which is made of sugar, water, natural flavors, potassium sorbate, citric acid, corn syrup, butter, cream, salt, mono- and diglycerides, soy lecithin, and sulfites. George: From calorie count to portion sizes, we wanted to find out all the differences between Pizza Hut in Japan and the US. This is \"Food Wars.\" In Japan, a Pizza Hut pizza comes in three sizes. The smallest comes in a My Box order and is approximately 15 centimeters. Our small can only be made on a gluten-free crust. Check it out. Looks like something you would get at your high-school cafeteria. And it measures 10 inches, or 25.4 centimeters. Our next size up is a medium, which is 26 centimeters. I'm gonna take this little guy. This pizza is so good, dude. And our large pizza is 14 inches, or 35.5 centimeters. This My Box pizza deal includes fries and chicken nuggets for 1,080 yen, or add a Basque cheesecake for 1,290 yen, or get three My Boxes for 3,000 yen, and you can get a free side menu item, like 1.5 liters of Coca-Cola. Also, for those wanting a little alcohol, you can get a My Box deal with an alcoholic beverage for 1,100 yen. It's called Being Tipsy set. Ah, tipsy. Now I'm going to the boxes, baby! Our next size up is a $13 dinner box. It is a medium one-topping pizza, breadsticks, and cinnamon sticks. This is the best idea. If I had to go into an office, this would be my briefcase. This is what I would take to work every day. Now, you're probably thinking, \"Oh, Joe, I want more food in a box.\" Well, Pizza Hut of course has you covered with the big dinner box. Ah-hem. Oh, it is the big dinner box! This is [grunts] two one-topping pizzas with wings or breadsticks. That's what I got, of course. You can also get pasta and breadsticks. You can also get Quepapas and breadsticks, or just a third pizza, all for $23.99 to $24.99. Man. Dinner is served. You can get chicken on the bone in two pieces, four pieces, and eight pieces. That's really cute, Japan. Two wings. In the US, our wing orders start at six, 12, 18, and the biggest order you can get, 36. Wow, that's the hottest? WingStreet, you gotta hire a spice expert, because this is nothing, dude. I've had spicier LaCroixes. Here is a Japan large basic pizza. We call our cheese pizza basic, and it is 2,030 yen. or $18.39 US. And it has a surface area of 754.77 square centimeters. So that is about $0.024, or 2.63 yen per square centimeter. The US large cheese pizza is $13.99, or 1,544 Japanese yen. It has a surface area of 989.9 square centimeters, which breaks down to $0.014 per square centimeter, or 1.54 Japanese yen. Much cheaper here in the US. So, here are two large basic pizzas. This one right here is hand-tossed dough, and this one right here is a pan pizza. Here are two large US cheese pizzas. One of them has the pan crust, and one of them has the hand-tossed crust. Both are the same size and the same price. We want to find out which gives you more pizza for your money. Let's weigh a slice of each and compare. George: Go! So, winner is: ta-da! Hand-tossed dough. Oh, wow. That's, like, that's crazy, how good I did just there. Look at that. Same price, 25% more pizza. Look at these! Here's everything you can get at the Japanese Pizza Hut you cannot get in the US. And here is everything you can get at a US Pizza Hut you can't get in Japan. Japan-exclusive pizzas! OK! So, I got everything on here in half and half and in medium size on hand-tossed crust. All right, so let's start with this one. So I got this toku-uma bulgogi. Toku-uma means special delicious. So it's special delicious bulgogi. And this one is menta potemayo bacon. Menta means spicy cod roe, and it looks good. So, next one we've got double shrimp with special lobster sauce, and this one is grand barbecue. Asparagus bacon. And this one is potato sausage mayo. Next one, we've got crumbling pulled pork, and next one, spicy pulled pork. Selected cheese and thick-cut Iberico. And this one is Super Supreme. Mexican Kara Peno. Kara means it's spicy, so spicy jalape\u00f1o on there. And next one is snappy potato sausage. And this one is green and yellow veggie pizza. Shrimp mayo mentai seafood. And this one is addictive anchovy and black olive. First exclusive-US-pizza pizzas. This one right here, it is the meat lover's pizza. Look at this thing! Can you see that? This thing is pepperoni, Italian sausage, ham, bacon, seasoned pork, and beef. That's every meat in the store, I think. This one right here is the Hawaiian chicken pizza. This looks like one bite would send me to my grave. This at least has a vegetable on it. I think green peppers were a mistake. This one right here, chicken bacon Parmesan. Chicken, bacon, tomatoes, and a Parmesan crust. Oh, yeah, dude. Look at the crust on this. They bake the cheese right into the crust. I just love that Pizza Hut's like, \"We gotta cover every surface with cheese.\" God forbid you would take a bite of something that doesn't have cheese in it. In Japan, you can get a pizza with four different topping areas called the Four Series. So let's start with this one. It's called Gochiso Four. Gochiso means feast. And next one, we've got Bulgogi Festa Four. So, let's move on to the next one. We've got Lovers Four. Lovers! What? Is this for this beef? It's gonna be horrible. And this one is called Kodawari Four. Kodawari means authentic. And this one in front of me is Gourmet Mania Four. What did I do to you, Pizza Hut? It's burned! Look at this! All right, next one. And the last one is Classic Four. This is classic. Deluxe! This one right here, the backyard barbecue pizza. Barbecue sauce instead of pizza sauce I think. And it comes with a barbecue honey. Shall I? I think I shall. Oh, yeah, I think I'm gonna like this. Don't sleep on the Pizza Hut honey barbecue. This is really good. I think this is Buffalo chicken pizza. Tangy Buffalo sauce. Exact opposite problem. I think the sauce ruins this. Too strong. Skip the sauce. So, this one right here is a Japan-only pizza. So this is a pizza with a boom! Sausage crust with bulgogi, teriyaki chicken, Camembert cheese, Gouda cheese, green chili sauce, shrimp, squid, tuna mayo, broccoli, corn, basil sauce, and anchovies. Too much. But let's give it a try. Look at this. Just too much. Itadakimasu. Mm. It's disgusting. In the first place, I hate anchovies. Don't put anchovies! It's just mazui! I picked out that pizza for you, George. Sorry, my man. Gotta do it for the show. Here is a USA-only pizza. It is a pizza with toppings and sauces and cheeses you can only get in the US and not in Japan. First, we have the gluten-free crust. Remember that really sad-looking crust? We can have a creamy garlic Parmesan, barbecue, or Buffalo sauce as a base. I went with the creamy garlic Parmesan. Got meatballs, banana peppers, and for the crust, pretty sure I went the garlic Parmesan. It's not awful. When you order food and you're, like, really hungry, so something sounds like it's gonna be really good, but then when you start eating it, you're like, \"Oh, I think I screwed up.\" This is definitely like ... skip this. [thud] So, here we've got Japan's exclusive sides. We've got chicken nuggets, and this is four pieces, eight pieces, 16 pieces. And we also have plain flavor and spicy flavor. Let's try this. Plain! This is plain. Everything is plain! I want spicy! Where is spicy nuggets? And next one, we've got honey cheese balls. So cheese balls there, and we've got honey syrup. So, next one, we've got Japanese-style tatsuta chicken. So this chicken is marinated in soy sauce and rolled in potato starch instead of wheat flour and deep-fried. Let's talk about US-exclusive sides. Can't get these in Japan. Pizza Hut also got pasta. Referred to at one point as Pasta Hut. You can get two of these baked pastas at our Pizza Huts. One is the Tusca -- Tuscani -- What? What'd I say? Fine. No, Tuscany is T U S C A N Y. They spell this one with T U S C A N I. No, come on. I'm looking it up. Keep rolling. Ad: Now at Pizza Hut, get a family-size Tuscani pasta for just 12 bucks. Joe: Ha-ha! Tuscani! In your face! Just an absolute abuse of Italian culture. Here is the Tuscani chicken Alfredo pasta and the Tuscani meaty marinara pasta. If I can't put a fine enough point on it, I do not want to eat this at all. This looks like a TV dinner. Like, this is what you eat in your apartment sitting on a folding chair, one light bulb hanging from the ceiling, eating this just right out of the oven, staring at a wall, looking at, like, cockroaches running up and down. Your one window has a view of a brick wall. The calendar on the wall is from three years ago. \u266a Nobody wants this! \u266a Quepapas. What are Quepapas, you ask? I don't know. They got jalape\u00f1os and stuff in them. So they're kind of like spicy tater tots. These to me are quintessential Pizza Hut sides. We got breadsticks, and we got cheese sticks. They both come with the marinara sauce. We also have a marinara sauce that you guys don't have. Vroom, vroom, vroom! Sauce Talk. So, here is extra sauces. So, if you want, you can get green chili sauce or honey syrup. So, the WingStreet wings you can get at Pizza Hut also come in exclusive flavors you can't get in Japan. Here are all the sauces. Spicy garlic is really good. Joe's sauce seal of approval. Teriyaki, this seems like a no-brainer, but we're not gonna leave it to chance. No! Ugh! I stand corrected. This is terrible. Doesn't pass. Garlic Parmesan. Oh, look, there's Parmesan on top of it. Oh, yeah! That might be the best one. Lemon pepper dry rub. Why do I have to apply it? Yeah, not into that, man. I don't get it. I don't know what Drake's going on about, man. The lemon pepper is not very good. Crucify me, internet! I don't like lemon pepper dry rub wings! Should I be -- I think maybe I should be rubbing it, that's what I'm doing wrong. Is that too much? Whoops. Yep, you were right. Too much. But it's good. Also, sauces, real quick, we got blue cheese. We got ranch. So, here is Japan's exclusive desserts. Here we've got Basque cheesecake. We've got Lady Borden vanilla ice cream. And last one, we've got Lady Borden chocolate ice cream. Desserts? We got 'em. In the US, you can get yourself this, a set of six Cinnabon cinnamon rolls. This is the triple-chocolate brownie. I'm starting to lose it, guys. All that pizza, it just hit me. This right here is the ultimate chocolate chip cookie. This is pretty funny. They should cut this like a pizza. Cinnamon sticks. They also come with a thing of icing. Gonna be my obituary photo. I can't believe how good that is. This is the Cinnabon thing. I want to try it now, since I had it before. I want to see how it compares to that. Cinnabon is still better. In Japan, our fountain drinks are Coca-Cola products. In the US, our soft drinks are Pepsi products. You know what that means. This is \"Soda Wars.\" In Japan, we have Coke, Coke Zero, and Fanta grape, and green tea, and Qoo. Qoo orange juice. Look at this face. Qoo! It has light orange taste. Classic Pepsi, cherry Pepsi, diet Pepsi, orange ... Crush right? Yeah, Orange Crush. Mountain Dew, and, of course, Sierra Mist. Which is like Mountain Dew, only so much worse. [thud] So, a full pizza is 2,256 calories. 112.8% of your daily recommended value. Too many calories! Ah! In the US, our large cheese pan pizza has eight slices, and each slice is 360 calories. So for the total pizza, that's 2,880 calories. That's 144% of your daily calories. And both the fat and the sodium are each over 200% of your daily allowance. Japan's large Pepperoni Supreme with plump bread crust is 228 calories per slice, or 2,736 calories for the entire thing, which is 136.8% of your daily calories. Even more calories! Ah! This is a large US pepperoni with the pan crust. Man, that's a thick guy! One slice, 370 calories. So that makes the whole pizza 2,930 calories, and that has 146.5% of your daily allowance. Now, I would like to point out that the large pepperoni pizza is the most popular Pizza Hut pizza in the US, but not in Japan. Online, it ranks about the 14th most popular. In Japan, one of the pizzas we enjoy is the seafood mix. It's one of Pizza Hut's best sellers for over 20 years. Wow. So, Japan's most calorific pizza is the large toku-uma bulgogi. And I forgot to order large toku-uma bulgogi! Sorry about that. But this one is toku-uma bulgogi. And this one is smaller, but large slice pizza is 285 calories, which makes the entire large pizza on plump bread crust 3,420 calories. 3,420 calories! Yabai! And in the US, our most calorific pizza is the meat lover's. I also was supposed to get the large. This is a medium. If someone in graphics could just make this pizza much bigger or me much smaller. One slice is 470 calories, making the total pizza, which should be eight slices, 3,760 calories. That's more than double your daily fat and triple your daily sodium. I am a glutton for punishment, but I'm not going to bite into this pizza. It looks like a nightmare. There's a few ingredients to watch out for at the Pizza Huts in the US. One is an ingredient found in our salad croutons. It is called azodicarbonamidates. [beep] Azo -- [beep] Azodicarbonmidee. [beep] Or ADA. It is a substance used for making vinyl foam plastics for things like yoga mats. And it's also in our croutons. I'm not quite sure why. The use of this additive, surprisingly enough, is not permitted in Japan. What? That's just horrible! Both yoga mats and salads have a connection to health. But US salad croutons have actually plastic. Yoga-mat plastic. How ironic. Also in the US you're going to want to watch out for Yellow No. 5 aka tartrazine, which appears in these Cinnabon mini rolls. Oops, already ate one. According to the European Union, this chemical, quote, \"May have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children,\" end quote. It is banned in the EU. It's not banned here in America. And it is at least not allowed at any of the Pizza Huts in Japan. You can totally get this here in America. Let's get some deficit on that attention. \"May have adverse effect on activity and attention in children,\" I mean, it's having a horrible effect on my attention as an adult. [laughs] I stopped paying attention to what was coming out of my mouth moments ago. So. The Dew got Yellow No. 5 as well. The Orange Crush has Yellow No. 6 and Red No. 40. Wonder if those are bad too. All the color things are bad. I have to say, this is also terrible. Why the hell American fast-food chains put harmful chemicals into their foods? Do they make their food in a chemistry laboratory or something? Use the kitchen. George: From calorie count to portion sizes, we wanted to find out the biggest differences between Subway in Japan and the US. This is \"Food Wars.\" In Japan, our sandwiches come in three sizes. This one is regular, and here we've got foot-long sub, and this one right here is party tray. This is party tray A, which is three regular sandwiches cut into 12 pieces, or we can also get a party tray that's three foot-long subs. In the US, you have three sizes: 6-inch, foot-long, and the party tray. This is five foot-longs cut into three sections, giving us 15 sandwiches. Not enough party in that party platter? Subway's got you covered. Here in the US, you can also get a 3-foot party sub. Whoa! Yes. \u266a Yes! \u266a Time to give this sandwich an exam. Dude, are you kidding me? Look at this. I'm seeing ham. I'm seeing turkey. I'm seeing cheese. And also we have a giant sub. Let me show you. [grunts] I got this. And this is what it looks like. This is too big. In Japan, our fountain drinks come in three sizes. This one is small, and medium, and large. Here in the US Subway, the website says there's a small, but I talked to the Subway manager, and they assured me they don't have a small, so apparently our fountain drinks are just two sizes. Medium, which makes no sense 'cause there's no small, and large. At Subway, I had to fill up, myself, the fountain drinks, which of course I don't mind. So any inaccuracies rest on my shoulders and my shoulders alone. Ooh! 40 what? Not even close. And that was like, I filled this up to the brim. I'm looking through this, and I'm seeing 33, maybe. We'll be generous. We'll give them 34. They still missed it by 6. 6 fluid ounces you guys are skimping on us? You get a good shot of that. Is that really 6 missing ounces? Do we think that's 6 ounces of fluid we're missing there? You better believe I'm on a high horse right now. This is infuriating! I'm really hungry, that has a lot to do with it too. On the surface, both countries' sandwiches look the same, but we wanted to get a closer look. Here we have a foot-long on white turkey with lettuce, tomato, black olives, and onions. All right, I have got the same one, so I'm going to weigh this. Joe: Wow, so pretty close. Scientific accuracy is really important in \"Food Wars,\" so. George: Now let's open it up and see what's inside. Joe: Huh, only a 10-gram difference, but ours had a lot more turkey and a lot less vegetables. Hm. So, here are all the Subway menu items you can get in Japan but not in the US. And here is everything you can get at US Subway you cannot get in Japan. So, let's start with new exclusive sandwiches. So, here we've got tandoori chicken sandwich. Mm! The chicken itself is tender. 9 out of 10. Congrats. So, next one, we've got tokumori tandoori chicken sandwich. Tokumori means extra large, so extra-large tandoori chicken sandwich. We've got spicy egg shrimp. So, next one, we've got ch\u014dkatsu chicken and cheese sandwich. This is not good. It doesn't have any taste. Man, what the fudge? So, first thing, I have this huge pile of sandwiches here. I'll just try and do some hits. Here is, of course, steak and cheese. Buffalo chicken. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause they put all the veggies on here too. They kind of just did the standard ones. I don't think this looks very good. Ooh, the Cali turkey. Looks like there's spinach on here. Oh, and bacon! Yeah, OK. Not bad. They ruined it with the cucumbers. The cold cut combo. This is, like, the sandwich, right? If we were playing \"Family Feud\" and the category was Subway sandwiches, I feel like the cold cut combo would be No. 1, right? Ooh, the Baja steak, everybody! Straight from Baja California. You know their blast, now try their steak. Everyone in the room just groaned. [laughs] [sighs] I have to know, how far is that bathroom from here? They really load it with the vegetables. Again, why would you want all these gross veggies on ... ? I want the meatball, and I want the sauce and the cheese. I don't want cucumbers. My meatball sandwich is ruined! I'm sneaking a meatball. Mm, mm, mm, mm. Yeah, the Italian BMT. Come on, this is, like, the most popular one. See, you got the meat there. Nice-looking meat, right? Nice-looking meat? Then you lift up the meat, boo! Boo! Who ruined this sandwich with vegetables? It is the spicy Italian. Looks a lot like the BMT. But yeah, dude, in Subway's defense, these sandwiches were made, what, three hours ago at this point? So, here are Japan's exclusive regular menu items. So let's start with this pizza bacon Italiana. Itadakimasu! I will rate this 7 out of 10. Molto bene! So, next one, we've got prosciutto mascarpone. Shrimp avocado. And I love avocado. Next, we've got turkey, bacon, egg. Turkey; as you can see, bacon, right here; and egg paste. It's not that great. And next, we've got chili chicken sandwich. This is terrible. Subway, how dare you? [crying] OK, I'm getting full, but let's keep going. Here we've got avocado vegetables. Mm! Next, we've got egg sandwich. All right, one thing I have to mention is that most of these sandwiches can be a salad. So if you like salad, go ahead. But Joe wouldn't get this for sure. What, did Subway get a panini press or something? Like, look at these. They just took these sandwiches and grilled them or whatever. OK, this one right here is the BMT. So, I'm just guessing for the melts, they do it on the white bread, and they add a bunch of cheese, and they just grill it, right? I mean, I can't even open this. Like, it's locked. Buffalo chicken melt. Maybe there's less vegetables in it, so maybe I do want this and I don't realize it. Steak and cheese. A Philly cheesesteak, right? Blech. I know this one. I know this one! Tuna melt. Turkey melt. Yeah, I guess. I mean, I gotta say, like, I haven't tasted them, but the effort in these are just like, what are you guys doing? I mean, they just, like, flattened them. Ham melt. What's SP again? Producer: Spicy Italian. It should be SI, but it's SP for spicy, right? That's why I'm like, \"Wait a second, is this the spaghetti one we've been talking about?\" Meatball melt. What'd they do? They flattened the meatballs in there, right? Oh, f---. I mean, it's better. Less vegetables, right? This is the chicken bacon melt. So, this is the Japan Only sandwich. Everything on here, you can't get in the US. It's a 6-inch on sesame bread with tandoori chicken, mascarpone, cream cheese, egg salad, shrimp, chili sauce, and wasabi soy sauce. This is a mystery sandwich. Itadakimasu. I said wasabi soy sauce, right? I got wasabi attack. It's hurting me. It's got too many flavors, and it makes me confused. This here is the USA Only sandwich, a sandwich comprised of only ingredients you can get in the United States and not in Japan. So, I started with the jalape\u00f1o cheese bread. It has meatballs, American cheese, pepper jack cheese, provolone cheese, banana peppers, good God! Spinach, ranch, sriracha, and pepperoni. [sighs] Here we go. That's actually pretty good. I really like this. Dude, that's good. It's not too spicy. The jalape\u00f1o bread's really good. The meatballs and the pepperoni work really well together. I gotta say, the banana peppers are actually welcome in this. It kind of makes it a little sweeter. I'm gonna take another bite. Yeah! Subway, put this on your menu. This is really good. I challenge you, all the viewers in the United States, start ordering this sandwich. Let's put the pressure on Subway to make this a featured sandwich. This is good! Mm! So, here we've got snack sandwiches. This one right here is anko sandwich. And anko is a staple of traditional Japanese sweets. The taste can be enjoyed alone or as a complement to other Japanese flavors, such as matcha. And here we've got anko and mascarpone. I have an announcement to make. Subway has breakfast. I'm just as surprised as all of you. Specifically, they have four breakfast sandwiches here in the US. A bacon, egg, and cheese; a Black Forest ham, egg, and cheese; egg and cheese; and steak, egg, and cheese. I don't know which one is which. I think this is the steak, egg, and cheese. Oh, it's flatbread too, so I can kind of -- [laughs] This looks like a cartoon! Look at this! Look at the eggs. Are you kidding me with this? At a Subway in the US, you can get just about any one of their sandwiches as a protein bowl. From what I can tell, that's their way of calling this a salad. So, you know my feelings on salad. I hate them. Just an example, though, we got what looks to be a turkey one. Everything that comes on a sandwich, but just instead of bread, it's a bowl. Then once you're done you can throw it in the ocean. Kill a sea turtle. Who cares? Why? It's a waste. It's an absolute waste. Just eat a sandwich like a normal person. There's nothing wrong with bread. Just eat it! It's a sandwich! Yeah, God. And it's the shredded lettuce, too. It's not, like, leafy lettuce or spinach or anything. It's just that shredduce that they put on the sandwich. [groans] So, here is Japan's exclusive sides. This one right here is korokoro potatoes, original flavor. And next one, we've got korokoro potatoes, triple cheese flavored. Korokoro potatoes, herb salt flavor. The korokoro means it's, like, rolling over and over. Like, korokorokoro. Korokorokoro. Rolling over and over. And last one, we've got corn cream chowder. Yeah dude. Chips! Chips! Chips! Get yourself the Baked Lays. I mean, the undisputed chip champion in the United States right here, baby. Nacho cheese Doritos. A favorite. A classic Lays. When you just wanna see what potato chips were like in the '50s, get yourself a bag of classic Lays. Oh, Miss Vickie's! Jalape\u00f1o, and lime cracked pepper. I don't think I've had the lime cracked pepper. These are so good. Sun Chips. I hate Sun Chips. Here's a side that you can get in the US you can't get in Japan. I'm gonna go \"muscle man's\" applesauce. So, here is Japan's exclusive drinks. This one right here is iced tea, and Pepsi, melon soda, oolong tea, which is Chinese tea, iced coffee, soy cocoa. And this one right here is vegetable and fruit juice, which has 11 kinds of vegetables and three kinds of fruits. And this one right here is Pepsi zero. And this one is mocha. Iced caf\u00e9 au lait. And this one right here is ginger ale. And soy latte, soy mango, mango orange, mango juice, mocha, and milk tea, cocoa, hot black tea, and herb tea. In the US, as you noticed, we have Coke and Coke products at our Subways. So we have Coke. And they also have to-go bottles, so I went ahead and got diet Coke, Sprite, and Gatorade, the fruit punch. All right, Sauce Talk. Sauce Talk. I couldn't get any of them on the side, but we have exclusive sauces here at the Subway in the US. We can get a red wine vinegar, a yellow mustard, a creamy sriracha, a Buffalo sauce, of course, we also have ranch, chipotle southwest, marinara sauce, sweet onion sauce, and MVP Parmesan. The most valuable Parmesan, apparently. I was surprised to learn that the Japanese Subway doesn't have cookies. The cookies are actually pretty good. In the US, you can get a chocolate chip cookie, an oatmeal raisin cookie, a raspberry cheesecake cookie, and a white chip macadamia nut cookie. All right, so let's move on to Japan's exclusive sweets. So, let's start with this one, chocolate brownie. We've got cheese tart, and this one right here is cream soda float. And this one right here is cream latte float, and coffee float. In Japan, our 6-inch turkey sub on white bread is 261 calories. And in the US, that same turkey sub is 270 calories. So pretty close. But I did notice ours has much less sodium, like 26% less. Our 6-inch tuna sub is 361 calories. And our tuna is 430, so a little more, but much more fat. I have not eaten tuna anything on purpose ever. It smells like cat food. Don't you think it smells? I guess most cat food is tuna, so yeah. This looks super gross, but I have to try it, right? Let's see if my distaste is misplaced. No. I hate that, man. Do you like calories? In Japan, our most calorific sandwich is the pizza bacon Italiana. One 6-inch is 436 calories. In the US, our most calorific sandwich is the chicken and bacon ranch. Just 6 inches of this bad boy is 500 calories, so a foot-long is 1,000 calories. In Japan, our regular sandwich with a small drink and small serving of potatoes, the total calories for this meal is 498 calories. In the US, a 6-inch turkey sandwich with a small drink, which the Subway I went to said they do not have, and a bag of chips, I went with the classic Lays, is 750 calories. In Japan, this meal total is 790 yen, or $7.23 US. In the US, that same meal is $9.14, or about 998.26 Japanese yen. Roughly 26.4% increase. In Japan, we focus on having a healthy diet, or ch\u014dkatsu meals. Ch\u014dkatsu means having a healthy diet that contains a lot of dietary fiber in order to keep your intestinal environment healthy. And it's getting common in Japan to have ch\u014dkatsu meals at home or even at restaurants, because a lot of Japanese people have a constipation problem due to a lot of stress and lack of exercise. So Subway offers a special meal called ch\u014dkatsu chicken and cheese sandwich, which contains a lot of dietary fiber. So it's going to help you return to your regular bowel movements, and you can start your day with a No. 2. So, we don't have anything like that, but I can only speak for myself that if you're experiencing constipation in the United States, may I recommend the steak and cheese at Subway? The Subway in Japan does not disclose all their raw ingredients, but they did provide the main raw ingredients for their breads. Japan Subway flatbread contains wheat flour, yeast, vegetable fat and oils, skim milk powder, wheat protein, salt, sugar, barley malt powder, et cetera. Well, our Subway in the US does gives us the ingredients, and our flatbread contains all of this. Now, there's a few similar ingredients, and there's a bunch that are pretty close. That \"Etc.\" in the Japan flatbread, that gives me pause. I mean, if that's supposed to represent all of this other stuff, that is a huge dot dot dot, or to be continued, or yada yada yada, that Japan's throwing at their customers. I mean, if America has proven anything, it's like, you can tell us what's in the food, we don't care, we'll still eat it. So, I don't know what's up with the etc., guys. Subway's tuna was a bit controversial here in the US starting in January, where a class action lawsuit made false claims about their tuna meat. The drama continued when a New York Times article claiming to have had a lab analyze 60 inches' worth of Subway tuna shared the results, saying they could not identify a species of fish and, \"No amplifiable tuna DNA was present in the sample.\" Subway responded, of course, saying it uses 100% wild-caught tuna and even launched a website, Subwaytunafacts.com, to give everyone a clear and transparent look into their tuna process. Furthermore, USA Today did their own fact-checking and had its doubts about how The Times tested the tuna samples and pointed out the lab tested for five tuna species out of 15 and concluded the tuna was too processed, or that there was no tuna DNA. Different tests have detected tuna in Subway sandwiches, and experts say canned tuna can become denatured when cooked. Then I did my own scientific research to find out what denatured means, and the scientists at Dictionary.com said, \"Dear Joe, thanks for reaching out to Dictionary.com! The word denatured means 'to destroy the characteristic properties of (a protein or biological macromolecule) by heat, acidity, or other effects that disrupt its molecular conformation.\" They went on to say, \"For further definition inquiries please just use the search function on the home page as that is what it's there for, don't email us.\" So, believe what you want. Another Subway ingredient controversy that's a bit more clean-cut, at least for the good people of Ireland, is that an Irish court ruled Subway cannot call their bread bread due to its high sugar content. In Ireland, for bread to be considered bread, the amount of sugar in the dough must be 2% the flour's weight. Subway's bread, however, the sugar content is 9.2%. George: From calorie count to portion sizes, we wanted to find out all the differences between Taco Bell in Japan and the US. This is \"Food Wars.\" In Japan, Taco Bell's standard tacos come in orders of one, two tacos with fries and a drink, or you can get five-pack, or you can get 10-pack. In the US, our standard Taco Bell tacos come in orders of one, three with a medium drink, or this, the 12-taco party pack. Check this out. I mean, they're not kidding when they say this is a party. You roll into any party with this, you are the party winner, right? So, this is a Beef Taco Supreme. It measures 5 inches. Our Beef Taco Supreme that's falling apart 'cause I'm an idiot is exactly 5 3/4 inches. And let's weigh this. And it weighs ... Boom! It weighs 100 grams. Looks like about 120 grams. And this one is our burrito in Japan. Now let's measure it. 5 inches. Our bean burrito is 6 3/8 inches long. And it weighs ... guh! It weighs 220 grams. Just a hair over 250 grams. Yeah, ours weighs more! Hooray! Here's our Crunchwrap Supreme. It measures 6 inches across. Let's go. Boom! It weighs exactly 250 grams. A personal favorite, the Crunchwrap Supr -- oh, man! Aww, guys! I mean, you get the idea, but it's just, it's just like a thing of beauty when they have the whole thing folded properly. Plus also now, all my ... everything inside's kind of exposed. Across, it's exactly 6 inches. Eh? Illuminati stuff coming at you. Six sides, 6 inches. Oh, [beep]. We're on to them. Here they come. If we go point to point, it is the less interesting 6 1/2 inches. So, we'll weigh it. You have no idea how bad I just want to take a huge bite out of this thing. It weighs a respectable 300 grams. That to me sounds exactly right. At the Japanese Taco Bell, the biggest menu item is ... [drumroll] Boom! The variety set pack. It includes two grilled burritos, which is chicken, and two Chickstars, which is fried-chicken Crunchwrap Supreme, and here is four crunchy tacos, which is beef, and here is nachos, all for 5,000 yen, or around $45.49. Did George just say $45.49 for just the largest menu item? That can't be right. That is so much money. Everything on this end is $157. Just their largest thing was almost 46 bucks. That's wild. The biggest single menu item we have here in the United States is the before-mentioned Taco Bell party box. This is exactly what it looks like, is a pack of 12 tacos, and in America, this runs you $22.99, or around 2,526.80 Japanese yen. Here is everything you can only get at Taco Bell in Japan, you cannot get in the US. And here's everything you can get at a US Taco Bell you can't get in Japan. Probably. I'm very confused. I don't know what half of this stuff is. So, these are Japan's special menu items. But before we get it started, I gotta mention one thing. It's that I have never tried Taco Bell before. This is my first time. I'm so excited. George, I can't believe this is your first time trying Taco Bell. Congratulations, and I'm sorry. So, here is Naked Chicken Taco. I don't know why it's called naked. Let me try. Itadakimasu! Mm! This shell is not a usual taco shell. It's actually chicken shell. You rock my world. So, here is DIY taco kit. I'm going to make my own special tacos, which is called George's Special Tacos. GST, yo! I'm gonna go with this crunchy shell. I don't have spoons, so I have to do like this. [shell cracks] One more time. You've gotta be gentle. [shell cracks] [Taco Bell bell ringing] I'm going to use this one. I have a good idea. I gotcha! Put some lettuce. Put some cheese. Tomato. Hoi! I prefer mild. Ooh! This is what we call GST. Itadakimasu. George just made his special taco, and it is, like, the most average taco. He was like, meat, cheese, tomatoes, and sauce. Hate to break it to you, George, but you made, like, you just made a ... a soft-shell taco. What would my taco be? What would my Joe's Signature Taco Bell Taco? Dorito shell, right? Everyone's nodding their head. Follow me so far? Wrapped in a gordita, right? Then the steak, OK? Then Tapat\u00edo. I don't know if that's on the menu there. That queso from Chipotle. It's good, right? I can put that on there. Guacamole. There's a taco chain in the Midwest called Taco John's, and they have these little potato things called Potato Ol\u00e9s. So I put some Potato Ol\u00e9s from Taco John's on there. So we have it, then we deep-fry it. I need a dipping sauce. What would I, if I was to dip it, what would I dip it in? Give me a sauce. Sour cream, are you out of your mind? Terrible. What do you think? You guys are terrible. You don't know what the hell you're talking about. Uh, ranch. We'll go with ranch. Spicy mayo? This guy's cream over here, like, it's Taco Bell, guys, get real! There's Joe's, and only Joe's, Signature Taco. Get it going. They just gotta collab with Chipotle and Taco John's. USA. Exclusive tacos at the Taco Bell. Taco Bell, or Doritos, or both, had the brilliant idea of going, \"Why don't we make our shell like a Dorito?\" And for some strange reason, they still have non-Dorito-shell tacos, which I don't understand why, because it is far superior to any other regular taco shell they have on their menu. Look at this thing. Look at this thing. I'm salivating looking at this. Nothing, including oranges, are this orange naturally. This is just a whole level of food chemical engineering, and I applaud it. Doritos, Taco Bell, here we go. Oh, my God, so good! George, you gotta come to America, and you gotta try this. Chalupa Supreme, I'm assuming that's this. The black bean chalupa. Yeah, we saw that. Yeah, that was the thing that looked like it [beep] itself. The Cantina Crispy Melt. It has a deep-fried shell. And then other than that, I see beans, all the veggies. And then this must be a crispy melt. The Gordita Crunches are, they take a regular taco cover it in melted cheese, nacho cheese, and then wrap a tortilla around it. Taco Bell answered my prayers by making a Gordita Crunch that has, in fact, the Dorito shell inside of it. They use ... yeah, and they use cheese to melt it to the hard shell. Best idea ever. You gotta know. Yeah, yeah! Something stuffed in something, with melted cheese. This is everything I want. Is it good? Are you a vegetarian? Is that why you've had it? Oh. Why would you get not meat at Taco Bell? OK, I understand. All right, to each their own. The spicy potato soft taco. I hear from a very good source, a very reliable source, that this is good. So, gotta know. Oh, yeah, dude! This is good. What's that sauce that's on here? We did not have available the loaded chicken flatbread or the loaded black bean flatbread. They are on the website. They weren't available here. We've got cheesy core burrito. We've got cheesy beef burrito. We've got Chickstar, which is fried-chicken Crunchwrap Supreme. Burritos. I'm already tired. Quesarito, beefy five-layer burrito, burrito Supreme, black bean Crunchwrap Supreme, cheesy roll-up. Did we see the chicken chipotle melt? Yeah, that was the one that ripped open, was the chicken chipotle melt. So, here is Japan's only side menu. We've got crispy chicken. Our Taco Bell in the US, you can get a side of black beans and rice or guacamole. So, here are a few menu items that are the same, but so different, between Japan and the US. Our nachos come like this. The chips and toppings are separate. I got two avocado sauce and tomato and cheese and sour cream. And in the US, and also Mexico, I assume, you get your nachos with everything already piled on the chips. Up until recently, I thought one of the key descriptors of nachos is that it's chips with stuff piled on it. But in Japan, they give you chips, as you could see, and they have, like, each ingredient in a cup, and you can kind of mix it. I think that is ridiculous. This is what nachos - I know, like, these are Taco Bell nachos. They also have the make-your-own-taco kits, and then they got the make-your-own-nacho kits. Don't do that. We call our chips Mexican chips. And they are tortilla chips that are flavored. Doing a complete 180, I am very jealous that Japan has flavored tortilla chips. I like tortilla chips just fine. The nacho cheese at Taco Bell, I'm gonna be honest with you, it's just OK. But I think flavored chips with this cheese would actually be really good. We'll take an L on that one, but it's the only one we've taken this whole video, so, that's fine. Our loaded fries in Japan are topped with beef and cheese and sour cream. And here in the US, our loaded fries are not existent. Wasn't on the menu at the one I went at. They are on the website. I don't know if it's just a Southern California Taco Bell thing. Our loaded fries have beef, lettuce, ranch, red strips, cheese, and tomatoes. Sounds very good. We were supposed to have Taco Bell desserts as well, but the store I went to didn't have them. So here's a list: ice cream, premium ice cream, cinnamon tostada, and Chocodilla. I want to try Chocodilla. That's all I can say. Our desserts, we have these little guys, Cinnabon Delights. We all know what Cinnabon is. We all like to be delighted. It looks like a little munchkin that may or may not be Cinnabon flavored. Let's find out together. Holy shit. So, these are our Japan-only drinks. We've got Coke and Coke Zero. Drinks! Sip, sip, baby! Look at all these colorful drinks. You eat and drink with your eyes, so I've been told, so naturally the whole color of the banned-chemical rainbow, right in front of me here, with every yellow number this, red number that, blue and the whatever, so. I'm going to assume none of these are in Japan because of whatever's inside of them. I'm just going to list -- I'll just do a few hits. Pepsi. We know that, right? They got Coke, we got Pepsi. Sierra Mist. I hate that so much. Baja Blast. Oh, God. This is Mountain Dew Baja Blast, right here. More on this in a moment. [coughing] Oh, good God. Also we have here is Mountain Dew Kickstart Orange. This actually rules. So, this urine-Pantone-color beverage can only mean one thing: that it was swiped off the side of a dewy mountain. Ladies and gentlemen, Mountain Dew. I will go to my grave knowing that flavor all too well. I don't know why they just don't get regular fruit punch. They have the Gatorade, the G2 Gatorade fruit punch. Pink lemonade. So, I heard that pink lemonade is just lemonade that's dyed pink. Just tastes like lemonade. What's in pink lemonade that makes it pink? It was originally, like, it was invented by, I think, a traveling circus. And they just did it kind of to get people to buy it. Like, it was a novelty. It was pink instead of regular lemonade color. But I'm assuming now they do something, they must do something to pink lemonade to make it taste ... That's lemonade. What makes pink lemonade different from lemonade? I want to know. Our Taco Bell also has coffee and iced coffee. And although I would never drink this, unsweetened iced tea. Taco Bell's got breakfast in the US, and I have to say, I think that their breakfast menu is fantastic. If it looks a little scarce, it is because I don't think they gave me everything. And I'm confused on what some of these things are, because everything's kind of wrapped. They used to have, like, didn't they used to have, like, a waffle taco? Maybe I'm just imagining that. They got a cheesy toasted breakfast burrito and a cheesy toasted breakfast burrito with potato. And, of course, they have a hash brown toasted breakfast burrito, which I think is this. Hash brown toasted breakfast burrito with steak, which is right here. And, of course, the grande toasted breakfast burrito, which is right here. And, of course, they have the grande toasted breakfast burrito with steak. And then they have a breakfast Crunchwrap. Yo, this one has eggs and potato in it. It looks ridiculous. But for real, when these are hot, at, like, 9:30 in the morning, you can't beat this. As a matter of fact ... This is so good. Even sitting out for a couple hours, it's still awesome. Taco Bell's breakfast is great. They're no McGriddles, but if a McDonald's isn't available, I'll go right to Taco Bell breakfast. You can also get ... Hash brown. Can you see him there? Breakfast salsas. These are really good. Orange juice. The homies over at Tropicana holding it down. Let's talk about nutrition. In Japan, a beef crunchy taco is 164.4 calories. It has 87.2 grams of protein, 5.5 grams of fat, 14.7 grams of carbs, and 293 milligrams of sodium. In the US, our standard beef crunchy taco is 170 calories, 8 grams of protein, 9 grams of fat, 13 grams of carbs, and 310 milligrams of sodium. So we lead in calories, fat, and sodium, where Japan has more protein and carbs. The next one is the chicken quesadilla. Ours has 492.51 calories. This one has 510 calories. One thing to note: that in both countries, one of these quesadillas hovers around half of your daily sodium. Sodium at Taco Bell appears to be such an issue that in the US menu online, certain combos and items, like this one right here, are labeled with sodium warnings. In Japan, a Crunchwrap Supreme has 1,290 milligrams of sodium. That's 56% of your daily allowance. Our Crunchwrap Supreme is 52% your daily sodium. That's more than half, right? Man, so both countries, way too much sodium. Are you looking for the most calories in one menu item? In Japan, it's our loaded fries. One order is 718 calories. It has a third of your daily calories, almost half of your daily fat, and 66% of your daily sodium. In the US, the biggest thing you should look out for are the nachos. The very popular Nachos BellGrande, I love you guys, is 740 calories, 1,050 milligrams of sodium. OK. Now, the Cinnabon Delights do have more calories, 930. But technically that's a 12-pack, which is supposed to be for four people. I'm certain, if you're like me, you're getting 12 and you're not sharing them. Some do, most don't, but obviously the Nachos BellGrande is for one person. But the most calories lie in an item that's on Taco Bell's cantina menu, which is only available at certain locations here in the US. There, you can get something called the grande beef nachos, which has 1,120 calories, which is more than half of your daily allowance, and 68% of your daily sodium. [sighs] Now, it's just not the food at Taco Bell. You also have to watch out for the drinks. Here it is, everyone. 30 fluid ounces of Mountain Dew Baja Blast. A beverage that answers the question, \"What if we combined Mountain Dew's bold, refreshing tropical flavor with crystal meth?\" This totally logical 30 fluid ounces of nightmare fuel is 420 calories, very cool, and 110 grams of sugar. I don't know. Sorry. This stuff is making me delirious. In the US, there are a few ingredients at our Taco Bell you should look out for. Both are in the beverages on Taco Bell's cantina menu. First is brominated vegetable oil, aka BVO, which is banned in Japan. BVO is an emulsifier found in citrus-flavored sodas and is specifically used with citrus oils, and it's considered a health risk when ingested in large amounts. It was brought to public attention when it was discovered in popular beverages like Mountain Dew and Powerade, but due to public pressure, it was removed from Coke and Pepsi products in 2014, which is good. Now, unfortunately, you can still find this ingredient in three cantina menu freezes. The beach berry freeze, the ginger mule freeze, and the party punch freeze. Luckily, they weren't in any of the freezes you'd find in the regular menu, only on the cantina menu. Ugh! OK. When it comes to citrus-flavored soda, we have CC Lemon. That's one of the most popular citrus-flavored soda in Japan. CCL Lemon contains the following: sugars, which is fructose-glucose syrup and sugar, lemon juice, flavoring, vitamin C, acidulant, safflower dye, calcium pantothenate, vitamin B6, carotene pigment. That's it. See? It doesn't have brominated vegetable oil. It tastes really good. So that means you can make it delicious without BVO. The last one, party punch freeze, also contains Yellow No. 5, aka tartrazine, which is subject to restrictions outside of the US in places like the EU and Japan, as it may have \"adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\" What the hell? You can tell this color is yellow, right? So why don't you use something else that isn't harmful? Just like CC Lemon. \u266a CC lemon, hey \u266a George: From calorie count to portion sizes, we wanted to find out all the differences between Kit Kats in Japan and the US. This is \"Food Wars.\" In Japan, our Kit Kats come in four sizes, big little pouch bite, minis, and bar, and classy one, Sublime. So, one thing to note here regarding mini sizes, the regular Kit Kat is 11.6 grams, but the flavored minis, such as matcha, are said to be slightly smaller, 11.3 grams. So I'm going to weigh them now to confirm. So, let's weigh a regular-flavor Kit Kat first. It weighs 11 grams. But it doesn't show the decimal points, it says just 11 grams. Let's weigh matcha flavor. 12. It's actually heavier than regular flavor. Interesting. Japanese Kit Kats have become popular all around the world, and the US, of course, is no exception. I just want to mention at the top here, we're going to be talking about Kit Kats that are native to our countries. I know you can get them online. I think Walmart.com has some of them. Fantastic. They're imported. We know. Thank you. In the US, our Kit Kats come in nine sizes. Starting from the smallest, we have a Kit Kat minis unwrapped, then the thins, miniatures, snack size, standard four finger, the Big Kat. From there, we move up to king size, which is, a piece accidentally broke off and then I accidentally ate it. The Big Kat king size. So it looks like it's just two Big Kats. And the biggest size, the XL. A bag of Kit Kat bites should have 11 bites. Let's count in Japanese. Ichi, ni, san, shi, go, roku, shichi, hachi, ku, juu, juuichi. 11 bites. And according to the bag, the combined weight should be 50 grams. So let's weigh all 11 bites. Ooh! It weighs 52 grams. Good deal. All of our US sizes come in a variety of units, depending on your Kit Kat needs. So many varieties. Here's a few worth mentioning. The minis. The biggest bag of minis unwrapped you can get is 419 grams. As the title implies, these things are unwrapped little bites. It's sold like it's for sharing, but get real. Whoever sticks their hand in here first, it's their bag. For the miniatures, according to Amazon, you can get up to 4-pound bags, aka 1,814.37 grams. And what it looks like, they just sent me a bag that's loosely 4 pounds of Kit Kat minis. All the bars have their various packs. None of them seem unusual. I will, however, mention that the biggest single purchase of a Kit Kat item you can get is the king-size 24-pack. The total here is 2,040 grams, about 4.5 pounds of Kit Kat. Here's all the Kit Kats exclusive to the US. And here is all the Kit Kats native to Japan. Kit Kat in Japan is made by Nestl\u00e9 and is one of the best-selling candies in the country. One of the reasons for its popularity is that Kit Kat has a good-luck charm in Japan because the name Kit Kat in Japanese is Kitto Katto. And Kitto Katto sounds like \"kitto katsu,\" which means \"you will surely win.\" So the Kit Kat brand became associated with good luck. And these Kit Kats are often given to students before their exams. For the past 20 years, Kit Kat has introduced more than 350 unique flavors. Wow! Some of them are discontinued, unfortunately, and some of them are regional, so we couldn't get them by the filming of this episode. Gomen ne! So here are a few standard Kit Kat flavors in Japan. Coffee break. But it doesn't taste like coffee, but goes well with coffee. So I brought my coffee with me today, so let's see how it goes. Itadakimasu. It's actually pretty good, much better than expected. So, next we have melon. Mm! It's so melon. It has way too strong melon flavor. Next, we have chocolate orange. Overall, not bad. Next, graham cracker. This is fantastic. Next, I'm gonna go cheesecake. This is marvelous. If you're a cheesecake person like me, you will definitely like this. Next, strawberry cheesecake. You get some decent strawberry flavor and cheesecake flavor at the same time, which is amazing. Next, apple cinnamon. I'm not a big fan of this. There is a lot of cinnamon in it, which makes this horrible. Pistachio. Look at this cute squirrel! Kawaii ne! Kawaii! It's not great, but not horrible either. Next, pudding. Mm! Mm, it's disgusting. It's way too sweet. Let's go next one. We have strawberry milk. Ah! Holy crap. This is nasty. This is the worst one. So, this is the last one. I've got cookies and cream. This is the best thing I have ever had in my mouth. Sorry to interrupt. But believe it or not, the US does have a few exclusive flavors you can't get in Japan. First up, pumpkin pie. Yo! This tastes exactly like pumpkin pie. Yeah, they hit it out of the park with that one, wow. Key lime pie. This one's so good. It tastes just like key lime pie. These are both fantastic. Fruity cereal. What cereal is this? Is that Froot Loops? Tastes exactly like Froot Loops. Gingerbread. Raspberry creme. I love this one. Yo, Joe, Yuelei. All right, try it, let's go. What do you guys think? Yeah, yeah, Starbursts, good call. Witch's brew? \"Crispy wafers and marshmallow flavored cream.\" These are great. Yeah, it has, like, a frosting flavor to it. Then we got glow in the dark. Wait, what's supposed to glow in the dark? The packaging or the ... ? That's not fun! I thought this was going to glow in the dark! The packaging? Let's see it, let's give it a shot. Nothing's glowing. All right. Lights back on. It's a regular Kit Kat. This is regular. How disappointing is that? Thumbs down. Birthday cake. Close to a frosting and sprinkles flavor. Man, these are all really good. Also in the US, you can get a lemon crisp flavor. Sold out everywhere. It was like a Supreme drop. The second those hit the shelves, they were are gone. Also Kit Kat in the US has this line called Duos. As you can see, three different flavors, two flavors in one. We got mint and dark chocolate. Mocha and chocolate. Eh, I'm already, I'm not predicting this is going to be anything special. It's just OK. Strawberry and dark chocolate. Is the way I'm eating these annoying? I mean, it's not terrible, but. Maybe strawberry and chocolate would've been too sweet, but with the dark chocolate, I'm just not into it. So these were fun, right? These were fun? No? All right, back to Japan. Kit Kat has a collection of flavors inspired by the many regions and prefectures of Japan. So I'm going to start with this, Mount Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan. It's 3,776 meters high. And the flavor is strawberry-cheesecake flavor. How can I open this? Here we go. It looks great. It's pretty good. But it tastes exactly the same as that one that I tasted 10 minutes ago. All right, next one is this Shinshu apple. Shinshu is kind of very old way to call Nagano Prefecture. And Nagano Prefecture is located in the center of Japan and is famous for delicious apples. And, finally, they turn into Kit Kat. Ooh. This is the nicest chocolate I've ever had. Next, we have Amaou strawberry. So it's basically from Kyushu. Kyushu is Japan's third-largest island and is located southwest of Japan. And Amaou is the best brand of strawberries in Japan. Marvelous, again. Next, I'm going to go with this one. Ito Kyuemon Uji matcha and Ito Kyuemon Uji hojicha. Uji matcha and Uji hojicha are named after Uji city, where they're grown. And the difference between matcha and hojicha is matcha is matcha, right? Matcha is a green tea. But hojicha is a roasted green tea. Let's go with Uji matcha first. Whoo! Matcha is always perfect. How about hojicha? It's as beautiful as my heart. Let's move on to the next one. We have beni imo. Beni imo, which is purple sweet potato. It's from Okinawa. So, Okinawa is Japan's southernmost prefecture and is famous for beni imo. Okinawa is my favorite place in Japan. I love this. It has just right sweetness. We've got azuki sandwich flavor from Nagoya. So, Nagoya is located in between Tokyo and Osaka and is famous for its azuki sandwich. Azuki is sweet red bean paste. So sweet red bean paste sandwich. Oh. It's not my taste at all. Momiji manju flavor. It's from Hiroshima. So, Hiroshima is located in the southwest of Japan and is famous for its momiji manju, which is kind of maple-leaf-shaped cake filled with sweet bean paste. It tastes exactly the same as this one. Sweet red bean paste. Japanese people love sweet red bean paste. Hokkaido azuki and strawberry flavor. Hokkaido is the largest and northernmost prefecture in Japan and is famous for its azuki. Much better than the other azuki flavors. Why wasabi? And it's from Shizuoka, and Shizuoka is located along the Pacific coast and is the top wasabi-producing region in Japan. Believe it or not, it's actually pretty good. Let's go! This one! Strawberry cheesecake flavor again. It's from Yokohama. Yokohama is located next to Tokyo, but Yokohama is not famous for strawberry cheesecake. I don't know why they chose strawberry-cheesecake flavor for this. It tastes exactly the same. Same! Next we have Tokyo banana. So, Tokyo banana is a banana-shaped sponge cake with cream filling, and it is very popular souvenir of Tokyo. And they turn into Kit Kats. Ta-da! Ooh! It's gross. When you come to Tokyo, you should try Tokyo bananas, but you should not try Tokyo banana Kit Kats. Rum raisin. It's from Tokyo. Tokyo is not famous for rum raisin. But it says, \"Rum raisin's gorgeousness and fanciness matches the image of Tokyo.\" There is a shot of rum. I don't like it! It contains a lot of alcohol. Ooh. Nande? Last one! Sake flavor, which is a Japanese traditional alcohol made from rice. This is a really interesting one. Oh. Personally, I like it. And this is an acquired taste. So, when it comes to sake flavor, we were supposed to have yogurt sake, yuzu sake, limited-edition Japan sake umeshu, but these were not available at the time of filming this. And we have Kit Kat desserts. We have Kit Kat Colliders, which I could not find at the filming of this, but it looks to be almost like vanilla-flavored cups with Kit Kat chunks broken up in it. Oh, man, I ate too many Kit Kats. And then we have these. These Kit Kat ice cream cones. Eh. I hit a wall real hard. I hit a giant Kit Kat XL wall, and I officially do not want to do this anymore. Better, but not by much more. Yeah, so that's it for the US. Sorry we have so few flavors. Japan has a Kit Kat called Otona no Amasa, which translates to \"sweetness for adults.\" Ow! R-rated! Don't let your kids watch this part! All right, so it's a line of Kit Kat flavors that are a little more bitter and less sweet than regular Kit Kats. So, here we have Otona no Amasa strawberry, white, and dark matcha and dark chocolate. All right, so let's give it a try. First. This is just straight-up dark chocolate, as you can imagine. Strawberry. Ooh, it's actually tart. This is good. All right, so let's move on to the next one. We've got dark matcha. Mm. This is so deep. Much deeper than the other matcha flavors. So, last one, we've got Otona no Amasa white chocolate. This is the best one among these Otona no Amasa chocolates. Just right sweetness. All right, so let's do matcha taste test. In Japan, matcha-flavored Kit Kats are so popular. Over the years, we've introduced 13 different, different, different, different matcha flavors. But currently, we were only able to get these three. So let's see how different they are. First, dark matcha. Deep matcha. But it's also deep. Ito Kyuemon Uji matcha. So freaking hard to tell the difference. But I'd say this one is the most delicious one. Kyoto. You can get it in Kyoto or order online. So, here we have classy chocolates called Sublime. So we have white Sublime and raw milk Sublime and a volcanic green Sublime and orange volcanic Sublime, yellow, ruby Sublime. All right, so let's try some out. I'm getting sick of the sweetness. Itadakimasu. It doesn't taste anything! I was thinking that it'd taste like strawberry or raspberry or something, but. Did I get COVID? COVID-19? OK, let's keep going. All right, so I'm going to go yellow volcanic. Volcano! Pew! Ooh! This is the bitterest. I've got orange. Bitter. Now I'm so scared. Green Sublime. It tastes exactly same as these two. So bitter. Next we have milk Sublime. It tastes exactly the same as regular flavor. I prefer this one. Last one, I've got white Sublime. Compared to the Otona no Amasa white chocolate, it's much better. I'm done. Hey, guys, it's Harry. I can't let you do a Kit Kat episode without me, because Kit Kats were actually invented in the UK in 1935. They would eventually be distributed by Nestl\u00e9 across the UK, the EU, and Japan. But in the US, Kit Kats are made and distributed by Hershey's. If you watched our Snickers episode, you'll know that there are some major taste differences between the chocolate in the UK and the US. Mostly that the UK's is way better. I'm going to do a three-way taste test between UK, US, and also a Japanese Kit Kat to see if there's any major differences between the three. And, Harry, thank you for sending me this with your cute handwriting. Thank you, Harry! Arigato. Let's try UK Kit Kat first. The UK one is obviously the one I'm used to. The chocolate is very smooth, not overwhelmingly sweet, and just very tasty. The UK is already a lot richer. OK, OK. Can I try US Kit Kat? I also couldn't find just a standard American Kit Kat anywhere. I guess we didn't bother importing the regular one. The closest thing I could find was this Kit Kat Duos mocha and chocolate one. Something doesn't taste quite right about that. Yep. UK, US, they suck. They both have too much sugar. Joe, Harry, try Japan's Kit Kat. Mm. Much smoother. Creamier. In terms of picking a favorite, I think the US one gets discounted immediately. Then, between the UK and the Japan one, it's kind of a different style of Kit Kat, I guess. I would say Japan and UK are pretty neck and neck. They seem very similar. Japan's Kit Kat is the best in the world. Ugh, I've eaten too much candy. Ugh! Perhaps we can pinpoint the taste difference to the ingredients. In the US, a Kit Kat is made up of sugar, wheat flour -- [beep] [beep] Our Kit Kats have the following. Looking over the ingredients, I noticed our Kit Kats have cocoa butter and chocolate, although it does not specify what that chocolate is made up of. Do we assume it is the same as the Hershey's chocolate bar? I don't know. Whereas the Japan Kit Kat has cocoa mass, cocoa butter, and cocoa powder. Now, if we're to believe that Nestl\u00e9 in Japan holds their chocolate to the same standards they do in the UK, it would mean that it would have a higher fat and cocoa content. According to the UK rules, \"a product must contain no less than 25% cocoa solids to be considered 'milk chocolate.'\" The US definitely does not go by this rule. Our Kit Kat is made up of palm oil, where theirs is vegetable oil. Same in the UK. It is cheaper, but it's also worse on the environment, adding to deforestation, increasing greenhouse [gas] emissions, and water pollution. So it is bad on the environment and tastes worse. Fantastic. But good news for all you vegans, Nestl\u00e9 has created a vegan Kit Kat, with substituted milk with a rice-based alternative, but availability is currently limited, so they are not available in the US or Japan. This is a US Kit Kat miniature, and it is 8.5 grams. It's the closest size we had to Japan's mini. This is 42 calories, 2.2 grams of fat, 6 milligrams of sodium, 5.8 grams of carbs, 4 of those are sugar, and 1 gram of protein. In Japan, the mini is the most popular size. It's 62 calories and 3.5 grams of fat, 3.5 to 11.4 milligrams of sodium, 8.99 to 19.4 grams of total carbs, and 0.9 grams of protein. The most common Kit Kat size in the US is the four-finger bar. 210 calories, 11 grams of fat, 7 of those are saturated, 20 milligrams of sodium, 28 grams of carbs, 23 of those are sugar, and 2 grams of protein. The closest size we have to that in Japan is the Kit Kat bar. It contains 224 calories. The most caloried Kit Kat in the US we got is the Kit Kat XL. Now, I unwrapped it here so you could see just how big it is. It contains 640 calories. The most calories you will get in a Kit Kat in Japan is the big little pouch bite. This bag is 275 calories. George: From calorie count to portion sizes, we wanted to find out all the differences between Burger King in Japan and the US. This is \"Food Wars.\" Here's everything you can find on the menu at the Burger King in Japan but not in the US. Here's everything you can find at a US Burger King you cannot get in Japan. All right, so let's start with exclusive burgers. So, here we have teriyaki lettuce burger and teriyaki Whopper. Ooh! Huge. Next we have avocado salad burger and avocado Whopper. Aah, a little cute baby. Look at this. And Whopper. It's totally different. This one is so huge. And avocados, tomato, no tomatoes. I don't know why. Next we have quattro cheese Whopper. Oh, big boy. We've got smoky barbecue Whopper and smoky barbecue Whopper junior. And here is spicy Whopper. Ooh! It's hot sauce. Next, we have tartar chicken burger. Ooh, it's got a lot of tartar sauce, chicken, crispy. Burger King in Japan just released a brand-new burger called Guilty Burger. It's basically butter burger. Why? What have you done? Let's check out this Guilty butter beef burger first. The bun is different. Itadakimasu! Just a little bit of butter flavor, but I don't feel as guilty as it claims. This one is Guilty butter croquette sandwich. Ooh. Guilty! And here is Guilty butter chicken burger. First one is something that BK has exclu -- oh, my God. This is called the Texas Whopper. Look at the size of this f---ing thing. Two patties, cheese, bacon, bunch of veggies. Wait for it! The triple Whopper. Look at the size of this thing. The weight of it has completely flattened the bottom bun. And there's nothing between the patties of meat! What the hell are you guys doing over there? Next. Oh, the Bacon King. Oh, my God. Looks to be pretty bacon centric. Looks like a double Whopper with cheese, bacon, mayo, ketchup, mustard. They didn't mess with the veggies. Thank you. You're not fooling anyone getting lettuce and onion on that one. The rodeo burger is a little guy with onion rings. The rodeo burger. Yeehaw. On to the chicken. I'll just put this over here. Japan does not have what we call the original chicken sandwich. And I don't know why Burger King, maybe just to set itself apart, the chicken sandwich is this, like, sub shape. It's like I'm holding the phone. This is great. Chicken junior, spicy chicken junior. Let's go spicy. Barely registers in the spice meter. Wait! Yeah. BKs in the US have something called the Ch'King sandwich. You can get the sandwich regular or deluxe. You can also get the sandwich flavor regular or spicy. So here is the regular regular. And as you can see, just comes with sauce and pickles and the chicken. You can get it deluxe and spicy, so we went with deluxe, comes with all these veggies that you brush off right when you start eating it, and it has got a spicy kind of hue to the chicken there. Here's our side menu. Let's start with this one. We've got hot dog. It's got such a big sausage. This one is chili beans hot dog. And next we have this little guy, snack chicken. And last we have this one, chili cheese fries. And if you want some veggies, you can order Caesar salad. But my bad, I forgot to order. Also exclusives to the US are these, chicken fries. As you can tell, they look like fries, but they're pieces of chicken. Not bad. You can get Mott's applesauce. Jalape\u00f1o cheddar bites. I've never heard of these. And now I know why. Burger King in the US has two iced-coffee flavors, mocha and vanilla. Assuming that's the mocha. Tastes exactly like chocolate milk. Blech! No. Oh, the aftertaste is horrible. What the hell? That's ridiculous how bad that is. And the vanilla. That is so sweet. I'm gonna keep this one. So, here is our dessert menus. Here we have coffee float. A little bit melting, sorry. And we have melon soda float. Coke float and Coke Zero float. And here we've got premium sundae chocolate and coffee. And here is our chocolate sundae and strawberry sundae. And my favorite is this apple pie. Desserts. Here in the US you can get yourself a Hershey's sundae pie. Ugh. This one might have got a little roughed up in transit. And in the US Burger King, you can also get various shakes. Here we have Oreo shake, a chocolate Oreo shake, a chocolate shake, and a vanilla shake. All right. God, that's so good. The straight-up chocolate. Oh, man, this is trouble. Mm! Wow, Burger King's shakes are really good. I'm assuming this is just the straight Oreo one. Oh, my God, this is fantastic. Are we all curious what a chocolate Oreo shake tastes like? Wonder no more. Good. This one's the best. Also at a US Burger King, you can get a soft-serve cone. I didn't get it, only because we have no refrigeration unit here and it would just be a cone with a puddle of ice cream. So. Victoria, please turn me into a giant soft-serve cone. So, here are our drinks. Let's start with this one. This one is ginger ale; and Fanta melon; oolong tea, which is Chinese tea; and orange juice. And this one is Earl Grey iced tea. Next we have Darjeeling tea. And here is Calpis, which, you guys call it Calpico in your country. But in Japan we say \"ka-ru pi-su.\" I know it sounds like \"cow piss\" in English, but if you say Calpico to Japanese people, they will never understand what you're talking about. So in Japan, once again, we say \"ka-ru pi-su.\" Repeat after me. \"Ka-ru pi-su.\" Very good! First things you can get, you can get a little orange juice guy, and you can also get Capri Sun apple juice. Shout-out to the pouch. Burger King in the US has Coke products as well, but we have something called a Coke Freestyle machine. If you haven't seen it, it's this big machine that has a bunch of Coca-Cola-related beverages. You can mix and match them. Anyway, we can get Hi-C fruit punch, Hi-C pink lemonade, Fanta orange, Mello Yello, Powerade Zero, Dr Pepper, Barq's, diet Barq's. You can also get yourself a fat-free milk. There it is. Sweetened or unsweetened tea. I think I got the sweetened. I don't want any tea. Tea sucks. We also have something called frozen Cokes. That is this right here. As you can see, it's been sitting for a while, it's starting to separate. But we have frozen Coke, we also have a frozen Fanta wild cherry, a frozen Fanta blue raspberry, and a frozen strawberry lemonade. Mm. Oh, yeah. Japan has a few exclusives that are similar but different to that in the US. So, for example, this is our plant-based Whopper. This burger is made from 100% soybeans. Itadakimasu! It's actually delicious. I like it. Mm. When it comes to vegetarianism and veganism, they are not that popular in Japan. But gradually, especially the restaurants in Tokyo are offering more vegan or vegetarian meals because there is more Japanese people and non-Japanese people who are vegan or vegetarian compared to other places in Japan. But overall, the vegan or vegetarian option is still limited in Japan. And in the US, we have the Impossible Whopper. What's the difference? Well, the Impossible burger has all these ingredients. So as you can see, a lot more. I am curious. That looks like meat, right? Tastes exactly like a Whopper. I don't think I would notice the difference. They're covering the lack of meat with, like, with that char flavor that they have on there. Oh, it's good. In Japan, we call this burger crispy chicken burger. And in the US, we have the before-mentioned Ch'King sandwich, which comes in varieties of spicy and/or deluxe. For breakfast, our hash brown comes in one big piece. Whereas in the US, our hash browns come in little bites. And in Japan, we have this cheese bites. Look at this. And in the US, we have eight-piece cheesy tots. And on to the US breakfast exclusives. As you can see, we have a lot more going on in our breakfast menu here in the US than Japan has. Here in the US, you can get your breakfast sandwich in biscuit or Croissan'wich options. Croissan'wich is, of course, a croissant sandwich. Took those two words, put them together. Croissan'wich. So we have bacon, egg, and cheese; ham, egg, and cheese; and sausage, egg, and cheese. We have two breakfast burritos. The Egg-Normous breakfast burrito, which I'm assuming is this one, 'cause it is enormous. The breakfast burrito junior. Look at this little guy! French toast sticks. Who doesn't like French toast? Finally, pancake platter with just three pancakes or a pancake platter with three pancakes and a side of sausage. The fries at Burger King in Japan come in three sizes, small, medium, and large. Fries in the US at Burger King come in four sizes, value, small, medium, or large. Or maybe it's value, small, medium, large. Does this look right? Any of you \"Food Wars\" heads would've seen the Burger King US vs UK episode where we uncovered Frygate. Two sizes had pretty much the exact same unit of fries. Now, as you can see from these, I can't tell which is the value and the small. I'm assuming this is the medium. Well, unfortunately, we cannot do that amazingly accurate scientific test that we did in the last episode because the fries have been compromised. They all came in the same bag, and ... I think they knew what we were up to and they purposely dumped all the fries in the same bag to contaminate the experiment. You've outsmarted us this time. George: Let's weigh the large fries to see how much you actually get. 151 grams. What if we did a thing where, like, whatever lands and stays on counts as it? Does that seem like a fair thing to say? That's really smart, what I just did there, I think. It's 195 grams. Let's weigh Japan's Whopper. 250 grams. Joe: And let us weigh our Whopper in the US. Yo! 270? Yeah, 270 grams. So pretty close. Surprisingly close. If you're not feeling like having beef, Burger King also has some chicken options. You can order your chicken nuggets in five pieces and eight pieces. Here in the US, you can get your nuggets in sizes of four pieces, eight pieces, or 16 pieces. And it's worth noting that you can only get the 16-piece online or through their app, and even if you do, they still just give you two eight-pieces. I don't know why either. So, let's weigh eight-piece nuggets. 130 grams. Divide by eight equals 16.25 grams per nugget. I don't know if we can get as accurate of a measurement for something so small. So we will use this guy instead. So I'll just do this and put this scale here. Ah! This is a bad idea. Eight pieces is 104 grams, divided by eight is 13 grams. In Japan, we have three drink sizes, small and medium and large. In the US, we have four drink sizes. Value, which only comes with a value meal; small; medium; and large. Now, I want to note that the US's largest drink size is 112% larger than Japan's largest drink. Now, what's the biggest meal you can get in Japan's Burger King? Over here, it's the King Meal. [singing \"Circle of Life\"] The King Meal ranges anywhere from 790 to 990 yen depending on the burger you choose. It has your choice of an avocado Whopper, double cheeseburger, or Whopper. We chose the double cheeseburger, which comes with small fries, five-piece nuggets, medium Coke, and apple pie. And in the US, currently our single biggest menu item at a Burger King is the $30 Ultimate Party Bundle. Now, you could only order this party bundle through the BK app, and it includes two Whoppers, two double cheeseburgers, two original chicken sandwiches, two eight-piece chicken nuggets, four small fries, and four small drinks. And it costs: $30. In Japan, a Whopper cheese set, it costs around 890 yen, or $7.80 US. Whereas in the US, the same meal with a small fry and drink is $9.29, or 1,059.65 Japanese yen. What about the medium? You get that with the medium fry and medium drink, it's $10.29, or 1,173.71 Japanese yen. What about the large? Poof! Hey, there it is, right in front of me. Large fries and drink, $11.29, or 1,287.78 Japanese yen. Let's look at calories. In Japan, a Whopper is 676 calories. The calories aren't too bad, but watch out for the sodium levels. One Japan Whopper is 113% of your daily recommended amount of sodium. Too much! In the US, our Whopper is 667 calories. Both Whoppers are pretty comparable in most of the categories, but there's one statistic that really stands out, the salt content. The sodium level in Japan's Whopper is 122% higher than that in the US. Let's make that a meal. A Whopper with large fries and a large Coke is 1,323 calories. And the same meal in the US is 1,680 calories, so a lot more. Now, a big portion of the calories actually come from the large Coke. The US's is roughly 182% more calories than that of Japan's. Let's look at the highest-calorie sandwich at Japan's Burger King. The double Whopper cheese is here. Eating one of these is already half of your daily calories and a little over your daily recommended protein. The main thing to watch out for here is the sodium, which is 152% of your daily recommended value. Whereas in the US, our highest-calorie sandwich is the spicy chicken deluxe sandwich, seen here. If you're worried about your health, steer clear of this one. The fat content is 190% your daily allowance, and the sodium is over 200% of your daily allowance. Yikes. As I mentioned earlier, the biggest menu item is the King Meal. If you get it with a double bacon cheeseburger, the total calories are 1,329. That's 66% of your daily calories. And, of course, the $30 Ultimate Party Bundle, which is 8,903 calories, or 445% your daily caloric allowance. Burger King in Japan doesn't disclose the exact ingredients, but it does disclose where the ingredients come from and where they're finished processing. For example, the Whopper beef patties are sourced from Australia, New Zealand, and Europe, but they are processed in Australia, Japan, and Austria. Burger King in the US is pretty vague when it comes to its ingredients. They don't disclose a comprehensive list anywhere. At the end of 2020, Burger King permanently banned 120 artificial flavors from their menu, including aluminum, yellows 1 through 5, BHA, and BHT. Here's the complete list. It was actually a lot of stuff. Good for you guys. George: From calorie count to portion sizes, we wanted to find out all the differences between Wendy's in Japan and the US. This is \"Food Wars.\" In Japan, our Wendy's hamburgers come in four sizes: junior, single, double, and triple. In the US, our burgers come in four sizes: junior, Dave's single, Dave's double, and the Dave's triple. Look at the size of this thing. In Japan, our nuggets come in orders of five and 10. Our US nuggets come in four, six, and 10-piece. Our Wendy's drinks come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. And in the US we also have three drink sizes, small, medium, you've gotta be kidding me. Look at the size of this thing. This might be 40 ounces, Yuelei. Only one way to find out. Ho! Oh, not quite 40. About 36 or 37 fluid ounces of Coca-Cola. And how big's a bladder? This looks like more than I would normally pee in the morning. OK, let's measure our large drink. It measures exactly 500 milliliters. Our Wendy's fries come in two sizes. Small and medium. Our fries come in four sizes, junior, small, medium, pew, large. Let's weigh our largest. [laughs] Roughly 180 grams. It weighs 135 grams. Japan's chili comes in two sizes, medium and large. And the US, our chili comes in two sizes, small and large. Let us weigh the largest now. Including the paper cup, 430 grams. George: Let's weigh our large chili. 265 grams. In Japan, a Wendy's burger USA double is 730 yen, or $6.38. Our US Dave's double goes for $5.99, or around 685 Japanese yen. That's a 6.16% decrease in price in the US. Let's make it a meal. In Japan, if you're getting your burger as a set, it includes a small fries and a three-piece nuggets and a drink. It costs around 440 yen more. Our meals only include fries and drink. So a small Dave's double meal, and I threw in a four-piece because we don't have a three-piece, works out to $10.98. That's an 8.12% increased cost in the US. Mind you, we did get an extra nugget. Speaking of nuggets, in Japan, 10-piece nugget is 510 yen, which breaks down to 51 yen per nugget. In the US, a 10-piece nugget is $4.29, which makes it per nugget around 43 cents. So per nugget average, the US is paying 8.11% less. A Baconator double in Japan is 850 yen, or $7.43. In the US, you get that same Baconator for $7.49, or 857 Japanese yen. So close. Only a 0.82% increase. Here is everything you can get at the Wendy's in Japan you cannot get in the US. And here's everything at a US Wendy's you can't get in Japan. One thing I want to point out is that in Japan, Wendy's is known as Wendy's First Kitchen. First Kitchen is a Japanese fast-food chain, and it was acquired by Wendy's in 2016 and became a hybrid of Wendy's and First Kitchen's menus. And we call them Fakkin, which is the abbreviation of First Kitchen in a Japanese way. It's like First Kitchen's \"Fa\" and kitchen's \"ki\" and \"n.\" And say: Fakkin. Repeat after me: Fakkin. [beep] Got it, buddy. Very good! So, here are our Japan's exclusive burgers. So, this one is bacon mushroom melt, and this one is just mushroom melt. We have Wendy's bacon egg burger. We also have Wendy's cheese bacon egg burger, and this sauce, tartar sauce. Umai. Everybody's curious what this is. This one is Wild Rock. It's got no buns. It's got two beef patties. I think I should try this one. Itadakimasu. This meat itself has a good taste and some kind of, like, peppery flavor, but it's a little bit dry. I wouldn't get this again. And last things, we have junior teriyaki burger, and we have junior teriyaki cheeseburger. The big bacon cheeseburger. The big bacon double. Look at this! Yep, one, two, three, the big bacon triple. I mean, I don't know what angle is best to look at this at. And then we got big bacons on the fancy bread. This must be the big bacons classicses. This looks like a big bacon -- look, it's got shredded cheese and stuff on this. Everything's bacon something with these guys. At this point, it's just like, how many slabs of meat do you want on your bacon sandwich? Two things you can get at a Wendy's in the US you cannot get in Japan or just the junior burger and the junior cheeseburger. Look at this little guy. Look at this. Literally every fast-food burger place has a version of this. Chicken! [grunts] The Asiago chicken sandwiches. We got the Asiago chicken ranch classic club. I said that in the wrong order, but you get what I mean. Probably this one. This is the fried Asiago club with bacon. And then there is the spicy, which I'm assuming is this one. And then they got the grilled. That's pretty good. Don't like Asiago? Wendy's got you covered. So many chicken sandwiches at Wendy's that of course are not Asiago'd. This is the grilled chicken sandwich. As you can see, it is grilled. And then we have the grilled chicken big bacon. Man, they must've gotten some deal on bacon for Wendy's. Everything's got bacon on it! I'm going to go ahead and assume this is the big bacon fried chicken sandwich, 'cause it has bacon on it. So you have the spicy big bacon cheddar chicken. In Japan, our Wendy's have pasta, which were originally on the First Kitchen menu. So here we have ramen-style soy cream pasta with spinach and ham. Expires 2023, January 20. Joe, I'll keep this for you. Nah, my guy, you can go ahead and throw that out. And next we have ramen-style dandan soup pasta with spinach and ham. So, dandan soup is kind of like a spicy chili-flavored soup with miso and pork mince. Dandan soup and dandan ramen are very popular in Japan. Tomato sauce pasta with mozzarella and bacon. All right, next we have beef cheek meat cream spaghetti. Plastic. Mm. Next we have carbonara spaghetti. Naotomo: Carbon-AR-a. Carbon-AAH-ra. Carbona-rrra. A-rrra? OK. Carbra-rrra. [crew laughing] It's got bacon and this creamy carbona-rrra sauce. Molto bene! Last thing I have is spicy cod roe spaghetti. So, spicy cod roe in Japanese is mentaiko, and mentaiko spaghetti is also very popular in Japan. Unfortunately, some Americans I know don't like mentaiko so much because of the texture and smell. But for me, mentaiko, it's super Fakkin delicious. Uh, it's been a while since I got this one. It's been, like, three hours. Itadakimasu. Mm. Joe, try it out. I appreciate the offer, George, but you can go ahead and finish that, 'cause it looks Fakkin disgusting. We got salads. Over here on this end, the first one looks like we got the Parmesan Caesar salad. Comes with, of course, Caesar dressing and what looks to be Parmesan crisps. This next salad is ridiculous. We're going to go ahead and put quotes around salad. Wendy's has a taco \"salad\" that comes with tortilla chips, sour cream, signature salsa, and, if that wasn't enough, chili. And before we continue, you confirmed that the taco salad is supposed to have chili on it? They told you that. Just gotta get the chips all around here. I can't believe this. This is so gross. Signature salsa, then chili. Oh, it smells so bad. Oh, God. Eh. I'm just -- this is just like eating chili with tortilla chips. They said there was some salt -- I'm just pushing this s--- around. On to the next salad, the Southwest avocado salad. Oh, my God, there's bacon on it! That's weird. That was in Dave Thomas' obituary. \"I want everything to be covered in bacon.\" But yeah. Chicken, avocado, bacon, cheese, and some sauce. This makes sense. And the last salad, apple pecan salad. That smells. Oh, 'cause it's got blue cheese on it. Roasted pecan bits. Pomegranate vinaigrette! Mm. Apples are nice. It's kind of nice to get a little bit of actual fruit, something nutritious while doing this. It's like my body's like, \"What is this?!\" So, here are Japan's side menu. We have a few flavor options for fries. So we have happy butter flavor fries. Happy butter flavor. It has just subtle buttery flavor. Mm. Burnt butter soy sauce flavor. Rip it off. Bwah! I don't know what's going on here, but it's pretty good. Much better than this. Savory steamed potato butter. It gets quite strong buttery flavor. Definitely I prefer this one than the happy butter flavor. This is not happy. This one is chicken consomm\u00e9 flavor. Mm. This is the best fries I've ever had in my life. Now I'm going to introduce you this spicy chicken breast. Wendy's in the US also has baked potatoes. See what we got. Of course, there's your regular. And this one, oh, yeah. This one's got, like, chives and stuff in it. If I was to stop here, you would go, \"Wow, what a tasteful selection of healthy potatoes.\" But of course we don't stop here. We move on to absolute baked-potato madness. Ah, No. 1, oof. Cheese baked potato. Drowned this thing in cheese. It's like -- ooh! It's, like, caked to the side. Blech. Ugh. Ugh. Oh, God! [laughs] The chili and cheese baked potato. Blech. If you are like me, you're wondering to yourself, something's missing. Something is missing from this potato menu, Yuelei! Can you guess what that is? The bacon cheese baked potato! Oh, they got big pieces of bacon on this one too. Oof! You can get spicy chicken nuggets. Yessiree Bob. Seasoned potatoes. All right, so fruit finally made the menu. Apple slices. It wouldn't be a Wendy's category without the Baconator fries. We need the bacon meter in this episode. Last of the sides. Oh, yeah. Oatmeal bar. Looks like a Clif bar. Whoa, that's actually pretty good. So, here are our Japan's exclusive drinks. We have tapioca royal milk tea with brown sugar and tapioca milk with brown sugar. Tornado. Mm! This is amazing. Simply amazing. I love this. So, here are our other drinks. We have Pepsi, orange juice, and ginger ale, lemonade and melon soda, peach tea and iced tea, iced matcha, and this one is iced cocoa. So, here we have our hot drinks. We have Darjeeling tea, and we have caf\u00e9 mocha, and we have peach tea. Mm. I like this. And we have caf\u00e9 latte and cocoa and matcha. This is matcha, but it looks like water from 100 years ago. Our Wendy's has Frosty-ccinos, which I'm assuming are Frostys meet Frappuccinos? Frosty-ccinos? But it does not appear that there's Frostys in this. They have two flavors, vanilla and chocolate. I'm assuming this is the vanilla. Wendy's did smart on this one. It isn't that sweet. I was expecting it to be, like, undrinkable, but it's actually kind of nice. All right, this one is the chocolate. Yeah. Also, it's a nice flavor. 'Cause of the Frosty-ccinos, you know what that means. At Wendy's you can also get: booyah, Frostys. They don't have these in Japan? I feel like this is the staple menu item. [laughs] I love these so much. Fantastic. That's fantastic. Gotta go for the chocolate. Don't bother finding me a spoon. I'm just gonna do a little taste here. That's great. The Frostys are great. It's like a milkshake, but it's super thick and delicious. Japan, you want this. Thick. It is thick! In Japan, we have floats instead of Frostys. We have Coke float and melon soda float. Japan has an exclusive breakfast sandwich. It's called the breakfast sandwich. It's got tomato, lettuce, and I believe this is beef or pork patties. OK, whereas Japan has one exclusive breakfast sandwich, we have way more. Like all the fast food here in America, we take our breakfast very seriously. You can get yourself a maple bacon croissant. It looks like it's a chicken sandwich that of course has bacon and maple syrup on the croissant. We have what just appears to be the bacon biscuit. Bacon, egg, cheese in the incredibly dry biscuit. Bacon croissant. I don't know about this one. Moving on to the sausage zone of the Wendy's breakfast. This is the special sausage biscuit. No, no, no, no, no. Here's what I hate about this. Pick a drier thing to have for breakfast. I feel like it'd be impossible to swallow a bite of this. You're going to choke on it. Here we go. See, this is what I'm talking about. They might have gotten this backwards. This is actually the better sausage one. This at least has a better chance of not getting stuck in your throat. The sausage croissant also has egg. Thank you. They have a few things that are honey-butter-based. I am so glad that fast-food places are introducing honey to their breakfast menu. I think maybe it has to do with the fact that chicken sandwiches have become so popular. First one we got here is the honey butter biscuit. [laughs] Hey, it's just a biscuit with honey butter. I mean, yeah, I'll have this anytime. I'll have this anytime. This one has some heft to it. It's the hot honey biscuit. Yeah! A little chicken on there. Yep. I really like that. This is the special chicken croissant. So, here are our desserts. So here we have Melotozzo. So, Melotozzo are maritozzo-style pastries, which are popular in Rome and Japan as well, made with melon bread. So melon bread is a type of sweet Japanese bread which has a sugar cookie crust on the surface. But what's funny is that it doesn't have a melon flavor at all. At all. The reason it's called melon bread is that it just looks like melon. Does it look like melon? It does in Japan. Oh! And this time, First Kitchen made a maritozzo using melon bread and mascarpone cheese whipped cream, and it's called Melotozzo. So here we have Melotozzo tiramisu and Melotozzo matcha and Melotozzo plain. So, actually, yesterday was my birthday, February 18. Hey, it's your birthday! Happy birthday, George! Thank you for your message! Thank you! Arigatou gozaimasu! So this is my birthday present. All right, so let's give it a shot. Best birthday present ever. Itadakimasu. This is so good. I can't stop eating this. Mm. So, Wendy's in Japan has a Japanese traditional sweet since it has been a collaboration with First Kitchen. So we have shiratama cream zenzai. Ooh. So it has three main ingredients, ice cream, and sweet red beans, and the shiratama, which is kind of like a mochi rice cake. And my grandma likes this type of zenzai. This is for you, my grandma. And also we have mini pancakes. In the US, we only have two exclusive desserts, and they're both cookies. And that's no disrespect to cookies, cookies are great, but I want one of those fun Italian ice cream sandwiches they had. Anyway, you can get two cookies here in the US, a chocolate chunk cookie and a sugar cookie. Our Wendy's double burger is 578 calories and 29% of your daily recommended amount and 60% of the recommended daily sodium. Our double burger, the Dave's double, isn't much better. Ours is 850 calories and way more fat. Over 70%! But less sodium, just a bit over half of the daily amount. Still, not great. Make it a meal in Japan, and that increases the calories to 1,089. That's 55% of your daily recommended calorie intake. And if you make it a combo here, we chose the small and took a few sips, that's 440 more calories, bringing the total to 1,290, or 64.5% of your daily allowance. In Japan, the single menu item with the most calories is the eight-piece fried-chicken pack, which contains [gasps] 4,018 calories, 201% of your daily calories. In the US, our single biggest-calorie menu item is the Feed the Fam deal. A fam, yeah, right! This is all for you. It is two spicy chicken sandwiches, two junior bacon cheeseburgers, and four small fries. Total 2,780 calories, which is 139% of your daily intake. Japan's Wendy's doesn't disclose their ingredients list. Why, Japan? The US sure does. Now, is there anything we should be looking out for? Of course there is. Let's start with sodium nitrate, which is found in the Baconator's applewood-smoked bacon. Sodium nitrate is a chemical that is used to cure meats and gives meat that appealing pink color. Perfect for bacon. Also, get this, it's super toxic. It is restricted for purchase online. People have accidentally eaten too much of it and died. It's also been used in homicides. Yikes! Sodium nitrate is on a list of Japan's designated food additives, but our Wendy's gets its bacon imported from Denmark, where it isn't banned, but being reduced in use. Our American cheese contains lecithin, a common emulsifier that, according to one academic, a worrisome number of scientific studies have suggested that too much of it can promote depression. [sighs] The pickles contain polysorbate 80. This is commonly used as an emulsifier in foods, but in pickles, it tends to be used as a solubilizer. Not how that's pronounced, sorry. Which helps other ingredients in the brine fully dissolve. Studies have suggested it can cause colon cancer in mice. Not fantastic. There is no info on Wendy's website of where the pickles come from, but we want to point out that polysorbate 80 is on Japan's list of designated additives. And therefore, it's permitted to be used in Japan. George: From calorie count to portion sizes, we wanted to find out all the differences between Domino's in Japan and the US. This is \"Food Wars.\" In Japan, Domino's pizzas come in three sizes. Our Domino's pizza comes in four sizes. George: So, this one is medium, which is cut into 8 slices. Joe: Over here on this end, you got the small. That's 10-inch pizza. And here's regular, which is also cut into eight slices. Joe: Next up is our medium. That's a 12-inch pizza. And this one is large. This one is cut into 12 slices. Joe: Then we move to our large, 14 inches. And finally, the extra large, which is 16 inches. Look at all that grease. A Domino's large plain pizza has a 33-centimeters diameter or an 855.3-square-centimeters area and costs 2,000 yen. So breaking that down, our pizza is 2.33 yen per square inch, or about 2 cents. Now take our large. This is a 14-inch pizza, also a 35.56-centimeter pizza. And it has a surface area of 993.1 square centimeters. That's 1.4 cents per square inch, or 1.62 Japanese yen. But what gives you the most food for your money? So, here's a large plain slice with a pan crust. And here's another with hand-tossed crust. Let's weigh both right now and see which is more. So, first let's weigh pan crust. 51 grams. And hand-tossed crust. It weighs 49 grams. And we will do the same. I want to note that right now in America, you can only get the pan Domino's in the medium size. Same exact experiment, only I'm doing two medium pizzas. Medium pan slice, medium hand-tossed slice. So, this is the hand-tossed slice, and it weighs a smidge over 75. We'll go 76. The pan. That goes in there too. 110 grams. Making the difference this amount. I'm not doing math. In Japan, we have seven different crust options. No. 1, we have pan. And No. 2 we have hand-tossed. And No. 3, we have ultra-crispy. Ooh. It's like a cracker. No. 4, we have cheese burst, where a string cheese is placed around the edge of the crust and sprinkled with consomm\u00e9 Parmesan seasoning. Ooh. No. 5, we have the cheese 'n' roll. It's got mozzarella cheese in the crust. And No. 6, we have mille-filet. Or mill-foy. Mille-fail. In Japanese we say mi-ru fi-yu. So this one is mi-ru-fi-yu pizza, which has two layers of crust with Camembert mixed cheese in between. Mille-fail. Mille-fee-yuh. French people, please correct my pronunciation. No. 7, the last one we have, the triple mille-feuille. It's got three layers of crust with cheese in between. Wow. In the US, we have only five crust options. I realize there's four pizzas in front of me. Let me explain. One crust option you can get here, and it's a small only, is the gluten-free crust. I don't know how bread is gluten-free, but we figured it out. Ta-da. We also have the hand-tossed, which is more of a standard pillowy, I mean, right, this is like standard dough, this is what we think a pizza looks like. This is the pan. Look how thick that is, man. That's, like, triple the dough thickness. Good on you for the pan. Now, you can get this in the medium only. We also have a crunchy thin crust. And we have so many pizzas here, to be honest, I don't know which one it is. So when it just comes up in the video, I'll show it off. But imagine a crunchy thin pizza. Oddly enough, we also have something called the Brooklyn-style pizza. This is reserved for large and extra-large pizzas only. And this is a Brooklyn-style right here, extra large. Obviously it isn't crispy, because it's sagging. This is really thin. Here's everything you can get at the Japanese Domino's that you cannot get in the US. Here's everything you can get at a US Domino's you cannot get in Japan. Everyone, look at this. This is a limited-time-offer pizza. It's called the Best 34. Look at this lid. It's disgusting! Don't look at me! Don't look at me! So, this one has all 34 Domino's toppings, like teriyaki chicken, mayo, spinach, tomato, shrimp. This is huge. It's like my baby. [sings lullaby] The New Yorker-style pizza is similar to the Brooklyn XL option you can get in America. But only in Japan you can get the Quattro New Yorker. It's a 16-inch pizza with each New Yorker topping style covering a quarter of the pizza. So one quarter is pepperoni, and one is cheese, and one is pepperoni and sausage, and one is ham and mushroom. So, here we have Nippon favorites series. Nippon, or Nihon, means Japan in Japanese. So these pizzas feature Japanese ingredients. This one charcoal-grilled teriyaki chicken. It's got teriyaki chicken, teriyaki sauce, spinach, mayonnaise, and corn. Next we have Hokkaido three cheeses. So, Hokkaido is the northern island prefecture in Japan, and it's famous for its cheese. It's got Hokkaido Gouda cheese, Hokkaido cheddar cheese, and Hokkaido Camembert and sliced asparagus. We have spicy mayo and mochi. It's got mochi rice cake and corn, pork sausage and sliced asparagus, and Korean seaweed flakes. And last one, we've got charcoal-grilled beef and spinach and mushrooms. Mm! Oh! Umai! Umai! This beef is so tender, and it's got so much, like, charcoal flavor, which makes this amazing. I love this. So many exclusive pizzas here at the US Domino's. I don't know where to begin, so I'll just start with this one that I'm holding. This is the Cali chicken bacon ranch. I don't know what makes it California-in-y or Cali-y, but it definitely has chicken, and bacon, and ranch, and it's big. Thank you very much. All right. Chicken taco pizza. Oh, yeah. Got taco spices to it. Good job on this one. Next one, the cheeseburger pizza. Um ... Yeah. Oh, my God. I'm going to say something crazy. This tastes exactly like a McDonald's cheeseburger. Even has the oniony and the ketchupy taste. Wow. That is a surprise. I thought this one was going to be bad, but it's actually pretty good. The extravaganZZa. This has pepperoni, sausage, ham, mushrooms, black olives, green peppers. This is the meatZZa, which I'm assuming is just a lot of meat. I'm seeing sausage, I'm seeing pepperoni, and maybe hamburger. Yeah, I'll put this in the good pile. I f--- with this one. Philly cheesesteak. Oh, no. In some weird way, I'm blaming you for this. Since you handed this to me, this is your fault. Look at this nightmare. Meat somewhere on here. I'm also seeing green peppers. Oh. Look, look, it's like, look at that, it's, like, stuck to the box. No. Buffalo chicken. OK, OK. This is more my speed. Chicken. No, not tomato sauce, like a white sauce. Good call. Mm! This isn't Buffalo enough. The capital of the great state of New York needs to be better represented in this pizza. The capital of New York is Buffalo, correct? No? We got the Memphis barbecue chicken. Love Memphis. Love barbecue. Love chicken. Yeah. The key thing here is the barbecue sauce. I don't know what is in it, but, man, that's really good. Memphis, capital of the great state of Tennessee. Everyone, here is the ultra cheese New Yorker. It's got 1 kilogram of cheese, or 2.2 pounds. OMG. Ooh! Look how thick this cheese is! Go! Go home. It weighs 180 grams, 180 times eight equals 1,440 grams in total. So, here are other Japanese specialty pizzas. So, here we have quattro meat max. So it's got charcoal-grilled teriyaki chicken and charcoal-grilled beef and giga meat and Goryeo galbi. It's Korean-style beef pizza. And next we have seafood special. This part and this part is shrimp mayonnaise. So this part, it's got shrimp, octopus, mussels, littleneck clams, Mactra clams, green peppers, and cherry tomatoes. Next we've got garlic master. Looks so spicy. Garlic and pork sausage and pancetta. And this part has got jalape\u00f1o, obviously. It's picante. Pepperoni and Italian sausage and onions. And look at this huge thing. Mayo jaga. So, jaga, or jagaimo, means potato in Japanese. It's got potato and pork sausage and a lot of mayo. Joe: Our US Domino's has sandwiches and pasta. I was not a fan of the Philly cheesesteak pizza, but let's see what the Philly cheesesteak tastes like in its native form of sandwich. Better than the pizza. Also at the US Domino's, you can get a Buffalo chicken sandwich, a chicken habanero sandwich, the Mediterranean veggie, no, thanks, a chicken bacon ranch, an Italian sandwich, and, of course, the chicken Parm sandwich. Our Domino's has four pastas to choose from. I only got two, the chicken Alfredo and the Italian sausage marinara. You can also get a chicken carbonara and a pasta primavera. I've just been informed I have to eat this. Strong flavor on this. I would skip the pasta at Domino's, personally. This thing is, like, baked on. See how baked this is? Like, come on. I feel like chef Ramsay here. Just, \"Oh, come on. Oh, this baked on here!\" In the US, we have a few chicken options you can't get in Japan. Yes, Japan has wings, but they don't have these flavors. Visually, I can see why. First flavor we got here is the garlic Parmesan. Hey, Domino's, what are you doing? Next one, we got, I'm assuming this is the honey barbecue. These drizzles! What are you guys doing drizzling, man? Just toss it! Toss it in the sauce! Nobody wants a drizzle. Oh, wait a second. This is the sweet mango habanero. I wasn't expecting that heat. Oh, man. Very good. These are -- why did you do this? Why did you do this? Toss it in the sauce. Why'd you just squirt it on here, like, as an afterthought? Honey barbecue. Right? Is this not nuts? This is nuts, right, that they did it like this. I like the sauce. So, Domino's also does their wings in boneless flavors. They have obviously those three, and you can also get these two other ones. And I see we have the crispy bacon and tomato, and this one must be the spicy jalape\u00f1o pineapple. Whoa, what? Hell yeah. All right. Get that B-roll fast. There it goes! I know. Your audible gasps are warranted. I don't know what this -- what am I supposed to do with this? Ooh, this one I'm looking forward to, Yuelei. We got the food less than an hour ago. I don't think an hour is unrealistic for food to sit. I think you guys gotta put some more chemicals in your cheese to keep it goopier longer. Ooh, I got some pineapple, and I got some jalape\u00f1o, and I got some chicken. Let's check it out. Yeah. Overall, everything here tastes pretty good. Presentation, you gotta work on that. In Japan, we don't have boneless wings, but we have Japanese fried chicken, which is called karaage. It kind of looks like American boneless wings. Ah. I love karaage. And also we have chicken nuggets. Both come in four, eight, and 12 pieces. Our Domino's has breads and oven-baked dips. Let's review the breads first. Shall we? Over here, we have Parmesan bread twists and garlic bread twists. I know that because of their totally twisted shapes. They also have Parmesan bread bites that were currently unavailable. Whoa. Uh-oh. These are very good. To Parmesan we go. Not as good. But still pretty good. I mean, it's bread and cheese and oil, right? US Domino's also has something called stuffed cheesy bread. You can get your stuffed cheesy bread with either spinach and feta or bacon and jalape\u00f1os. Take a wild guess which one I chose. [beep] Just ripping this whole [beep] thing apart. Oh, God! This thing is especially greasy. For whatever reason, Domino's didn't stop there. Domino's has something called dips. [sighs] What it appears to be is a giant dish of melted cheese. And you can get it in cheesy marinara or five cheese. What are we doing, Domino's? [laughs] What is this? Come on, guys. So, this is the marinara one, I'm assuming. A pizza without the bread, right? These dips are literally zapping my will to live. Please don't ever get ... It's a whole bowl of cheese, Yuelei! Why would -- oh, look at the oil in this too! Everyone in here just gagged. Can I even dip it? Oh, whoa. I don't know what of the five cheeses is in here, like, which five. Why am I eating this?! Ugh! So, here are our Japanese exclusive side-menu items. Let's start with this one. We've got oven-baked potato wedges. This one is plain. Consomm\u00e9. Chili garlic. And this one is butter. And next we have cheese sticks. Shrimp popcorn. It comes with this tartar sauce. Here we have choregi salad. We've got Korean-style seaweed flakes and choregi dressing. So, choregi is, like, Korean-style sesame-oil dressing. And fresh salad in the package. So, here we have corn potage. Clam chowder. Minestrone. Black chili. You've seen these before. It is the Domino's marbled cookie brownies. \u266a Liquid sugar \u266a Oh, yeah. You can also get these cinnamon bread twists. Lastly, another dip. I swear to God, if there's cheese in this, I'm walking out of here and I'm never coming back. Baked apple dips. And I'm assuming you dip these into this. I'm not gonna. So, here are our other desserts. We have mini pancakes, heart-shaped fondant chocolate, and here we have egg custard tart. I have never tried this one before. Itadakimasu. Mm. Mm! This is so good. So flaky. Mm. This one is apple pie. And next we have custard pie. Lastly, of the sodas you can get in the US, can't get in Japan, get yourself Fanta orange and Sprite. We have Coke Zero. It's supposed to be Zero, but they gave us just normal Coke. Next, we have ginger ale. Canada Dry. Canada is an amazing country, eh? Qoo orange juice. And here is Sokenbicha. It's Japanese blended tea. And last one, we've got Georgia Japan Craftsman caf\u00e9 latte. Georgia Japan. Sounds like George Japan. I'd like to be sponsored by you. Let me try this. It's got a lot of milk and sugar in it. I gotta be honest. It's not my taste. Take two. I really love this. Please give me a sponsorship. A Japan large hand-tossed pizza is 130 calories per slice, or 1,560 calories for the full pizza. In the US, a large hand-tossed pizza slice is 280 calories, which makes the entire pizza 2,240 calories. A large big-pepperoni hand-tossed slice is 335 calories per slice, or 4,020 calories for the entire pizza. Our large pepperoni is 370 calories per slice, which makes the entire pie 2,960 calories. Japan's most calorific pizza is the ultra cheese New Yorker size. One slice is 478 calories. That's 3,827 for the full pizza. Ah. Our US Domino's pizza with the most calories is the Cali chicken bacon ranch. This is an XL of said pizza. One slice is 560 calories, and that makes the full pie 3,360 calories. Our large plain pizza has 1,620 calories total. Our large cheese is 2,240 calories. That's a 38.2% increase. Our large big pepperoni is 2,680 calories, over 34% of your daily recommended calorie intake. 333% of your daily sodium. Ah! Too many tasty calories! Ours is 2,960 calories, 48% over your daily recommended amount, but somehow ours has less sodium, only 299% of your daily sodium. In October of last year, a study found detectable amounts of phthalate, a plastic softener, in common menu items from large fast-food chains, including Domino's. The study analyzed 64 food samples from several popular fast-food chains and found phthalates DnBP and DEHP in a majority of the items. USA Today reported that, \"Food containing meat, such as chicken burritos and cheeseburgers, had higher levels of the chemicals studied, while cheese pizza had the lowest levels.\" OK, so that's good news for Domino's, I guess. The study goes on to say that \"food handling gloves contain replacement plasticizers, which may be [a] source of food contamination.\" Sounds to me like an easy fix. Just prepare the food without gloves. Japan has a ban on DEHP in food-handling gloves. Good-er news, if you're a fan of \"Food Wars\" and saw the US versus UK Domino's episode, we highlighted BHA and BHT in the US pepperoni. Well, on the stewardship page on Domino's website, they have stated, ahem, \"We have eliminated a long list of ingredients from all of our core products including BHA and BHT and PHOs, as well as trans-fat from core pizza products,\" which is fantastic news. I clearly was going to eat it anyway, but thank you regardless. From calorie count to portion sizes, we wanted to find out all the differences between Pocky in Japan and the US. This is \"Food Wars.\" In Japan, our Pocky comes in a 72-gram box which contains two packets and a nine-pack. (Pocky wrapper crinkles) - Our Pocky's come in basically three sizes. The one 1.14-ounce box, the 2.47-ounce box, and the 4.13-ounce boxy bag. But our strawberry-flavored box is smaller than this chocolate box. This is a 3.81-ounce box, which is 0.32 ounces smaller than this one. Largest box bag is this, the Cookies & Cream flavor, which is 4.57 ounces or 0.44 grams larger than the chocolate box. One theory, my theory, is that the Pocky boxes contain a specific number of Pocky sticks and each Pocky is a different weight based on the flavor coating. So we're gonna weigh each Pocky individually to see if this is true. All right, chocolate first. So seven of these are 13 grams. Can someone write that down? Strawberry, seven is 13 grams. Was that what the first one was? Okay. Cookies & Cream! Cookies & Cream, seven of them are 18 grams. Well, the Cookies & Cream ones are definitely a lot heavier. A lot heavier. (Joe chomping) Mm! - So let's see how many Pocky are in a box. (George counting in Japanese) (audio chirping) 32, 33, 34. Thirty-four Pocky in total. So one packet has 17 Pocky and another one also has 17 Pocky. - Let's see how many Pocky's are in this box. (Pocky wrapper crinkles) (exhales) Oh, man. Is this normal? I think I can kind of like, do you wanna get a close-up on there before? So one, two, three, those are the broken ones. (audio chirping) 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36. You know how everyone was complaining about how I eat Kit-Kats in the Kit-Kat episode? (suspenseful music) (Joe chomps) (Joe chewing) Mm! (upbeat music) Here's all the Pocky's that are native to the US that are not in Japan. - And here are all the Pocky's native to Japan. - Cookies & Cream, Cookies & Cream. Not a solid block, so that's good. (Pocky wrapper crinkles) (Joe chomping) Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm! I like those. This looks like fun, Yuelei. Chocolate Banana, have you had these before? You have? No, mm-mm. That banana flavor hits right away. Oh, no. Matcha green tea. Any \"Food Wars\" heads watching know, Joe does not like matcha. Mm, smells like a freshly-cut lawn. (lawnmower rumbles) (Joe chomps) Yeah, nah. There's also a Crunchy Strawberry flavor you can get here in the US, but I was not able to get my hands on it by the time of filming this episode. So here's just regular strawberry. Uh-oh. Oh, another solid block. Yeah. (Joe chomps) (audience gasps) Mm, yeah, dude. Put me in jail for crimes against Pocky's. - George's energy. Bong, let's go! All right, let's start with this one. We have Pocky Luxury Milk Chocolate. (laughs) Is it Pocky? You look like corn dog. What happened to you? Hmm. It's got milk and fermented butter flavor. And we have another corn dog. It's a Almond Milk flavor. (George speaks in Japanese) Mm. It has strong almond milk flavor. I prefer this one, the milk chocolate, but both are so short. You should be longer. (whistle screeches) You too! We have this ultra-thin Pocky. Oh. (laughs) You are so thin this time. This one is short. This one is so thin. We have Tasty. Why is it Tasty? Oh, fermented butter is used for this stick. Ooh. (George chomps) It's got just a little bit of butter flavor. I still prefer this one, this corn dog. Almond Crush. It's a little different. Look at the packets. Yeah, obviously, it's got almonds. Okey-dokey, Pocky. (George speaks in Japanese) I love this. I love this. Mm. We've got Pocky Chocolate Coconut. Oh, this one is also this style of packets. Oh. It's pretty similar with this one, Almond Crush. (George chomps) Hmm? Yeah, obviously, it's got coconut flavor, and also, it's got a little bit of saltiness. It's not my taste. Strawberry chocolate Pocky. (George chomps) Oh. Ah. Right after you bite this, you get some sweetness. But after that, you get sourness. It smells so strong. I can smell it from here. Cocoa powder Pocky, And it says you can only get this in winter season. Oh yeah, look at this. It's got cocoa powder. (George speaks in Japanese) (George's lips smack) We've got the cutest Pocky ever. Cherry heart-shaped Pocky. Aha. Oh, look at this! Heart! It's in there. How cute. And this part, cherry chocolate is so awesome. You get strong cherry flavor. We've also got blueberry heart-shaped chocolate Pocky. (Pocky wrapper crinkles) Ooh, look at this. So blue. This color doesn't make me want to eat this, but let's try. (George speaks in Japanese) Ooh! Mm. So sour. But look at this heart-shaped Pocky. Not for me. This is what I've been waiting for, sakura matcha. So \"sakura\" means cherry blossom. Cherry blossom matcha taste. Ooh. Look at this! So it's got matcha chocolate and this stick is pink. (George chomps) Mm, this is so Japanese-y Pocky. Just sweet matcha. The feeling of spring has come to my life. (bird chirping) Spring days here in my body. (George sings in Japanese) Everybody's curious what these are. Megami no Ruby. Otona no Kohaku. What does it mean? I don't even know. (laughs) Anyway, so it says Megami no Ruby. It means like, \"Goddess Ruby\". Otona no Kohaku, in English, it says, \"amber.\" Kind of like stone, fossil, jewel. It says it goes well with red wine. Interesting. Ta-da! It looks like regular chocolate Pocky. (George chomps) Oh? What is this? This taste itself is like berries. This one goes well with whiskey. (George chomps) Huh? It's pretty close to dark chocolate, it's bitter. In Japan, we have this Gokuboso extra-fine Pocky, which are roughly half the thickness of a regular chocolate Pocky. - In the US, ours are called the Ultra Slim. - I got a new digital scale. What I'm gonna do is weigh a regular chocolate Pocky. 2.13 grams. So ultra thin Pocky. So it weighs 1.52 grams. - Thinner, that's it? Here's a big boy. Here's the thin. Is it able to do this? Can I get out of the way so it's just the white background? 23, 24, 25, and there's another bag in here, so 50 per box. Okay, so 50 instead of 36. Seven regular Pocky's are 13 grams. Let's see how many slim ones we needed to get to 13 grams. 5, 6, 7, 8 1/2. Eight and a half slim ones are the same as seven regular ones. Is that that much slimmer? I guess that's slimmer. Does anyone think that's not significant enough to be a selling point? Pocky adjusts its sweetness for different countries. Not surprisingly, the US ones are meant to be sweeter. I'm gonna do a taste test side by side. We got the American ones and the Japanese one, and we're gonna see just how different they taste. I'm worried that these are also gonna be a Pocky popsicle. Oh no, okay. Japanese. These are only Japanese ones I can find. Obviously, they're bigger. I don't know if this is the norm. (Joe chomps) Mm-hm, in the baseline sweetness. Yeah. Mm. (Joe chomps) Yeah, it's noticeably different. They taste identical, but ours has a sweet aftertaste. I like the Japanese ones much better. - So Pocky is in the Guinness World Records three times. It's the largest chocolate-coated biscuits brand, has the most mentions of a brand name on Twitter in 24 hours, which was 3,710,044 times. And finally, it was part of the most people opening packaged food online simultaneously with 143 people. - 143 people, that's it? That doesn't seem like that many. I feel like I've been on Zoom work calls with 143 people in it, right? It would've been literally one email to set that up. - I can do (George speaks in Japanese). Pom-pom-pom-pom-pom-pom-pom-pom-pom-pom-pom-pom-pom. Now I got more than 200 George's clones right here. Simultaneously, three, two, one. Boom. Now I broke the Guinness World Records. So November 11th is known as a Pocky (speaks in Japanese) or Pocky Day in Japan. This date was chosen because a Pocky is shaped like a one. At November 11th, visually, it looks like four Pocky. And also, Pretz are included in this day, November 11th, which is the pretzel version of Pocky. And in Japan, you can get them in flavors like Salad, Ripe Tomato, Sweet Potato, and Roasted Bread flavor. In the US, we also have Pretz, and we get these fun flavors like Sweet Corn, fun, and Pizza. Oh, God. It has nothing on it. (Joe chomps) Nope. I mean, yeah, it tastes like corn. Why though? What is the demand for corn-flavored sticks? (Joe sighs) Besides pizza, anything flavored like pizza is terrible. Even pizza combos aren't very good. (Pretz wrapper crinkles) No. (Joe chomps) I mean, it's up there with croutons. Does anyone grab a handful of croutons on-the-go? And would just eating a box of croutons. These probably would be good on something. (catchy music) - In Japan, our chocolate Pocky box, per 100 grams, has 506 calories. Adjusted for the box size, 72 grams, the package contains 364.3 calories. And let's break it down even further to per Pocky. One Pocky contains, on average, 11.38 calories. - A US chocolate Pocky box contains 340 calories. Just a little bit less than a Japanese box, but note, there is a two-gram difference. Now here at \"Food Wars\", we thrive on scientific accuracy. So let's break it down per Pocky. One US Pocky is 9.44444444444444444... calories. - The highest-calorie Pocky in Japan is to be determined. We emailed the customer service, but we didn't get their response. What are you doing? Hurry up! But I guess this Pocky is the most calorific Pocky. It's 196 calories. So it should be 'cause it's got a lot of butter in it. - The US Pocky with the most calories is the Cookies & Cream. It contains total 630 calories. There's no question I can murder this whole box in one sitting. 630 calories? That's nothing. That's kind of reassuring like, \"Wow, only 630? Found my breakfast!\" (steady music) - Japa-Pocky contains these ingredients. Wheat flour, sugar, cacao mass, vegetable oils, whole-milk powder, shortening, malt extract, starch, salt, yeast, cocoa powder, butter, emulsifier, flavoring, leavening agent, annatto coloring, and mineral salt. - Any US Pocky contains wheat flour, sugar, chocolate liquor, blend of vegetable oils, that blend being sunflower oil, palm oil, whole-milk powder, vegetable oil shortening, which is palm oil, hydrogenated palm oil, and cocoa butter, salt, artificial flavors, yeast, soy lecithin, leavening, sodium bicarbonate, mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids. Wink. - In Japan, our Pocky contains malt extract, which is sometimes used as a replacement for sugar in baking. It contains lots of maltose, a type of sugar which actually has a higher glycemic index value than normal sucrose. So it's a surprise that American Pocky are supposed to be sweeter. - There are actually differences in the types of cocoa used. If you've watched the \"US versus UK Snickers\" episode, you know that American chocolate is not so great. In the US, our Pockys are made with chocolate liquor and cocoa butter. Chocolate liquor is just cocoa that's been processed into semisolid form, and it's actually around 50% cocoa butter itself. The trouble is for an American product to be classified as milk chocolate, it only needs to contain around 10% of chocolate liquor, and the rest can be made up of sugars and various ingredients. - In Japan, the rules are different, depending on the type of product. Milk chocolate material must contain at least 21% cocoa content, double the required amount in America. So our chocolate has more chocolate. Are you jealous of us? Come to Japan. George: From calorie count to portion sizes, we wanted to find out all the differences between 7-Eleven in Japan and the US. This is \"Food Wars.\" In Japan, our coffees come in regular -- Joe: In small, medium, large, George: And large. and extra large. If you're getting coffee, why not grab a chocolate doughnut? Our 7-Eleven drinks come in sizes of 200 milliliters, 450 milliliters, and 1 liter, and 1.5 liters. I'm sorry, I couldn't get it. [laughing maniacally] In the US, we have Big Gulps, self-service fountain drink for sodas, and they come in these four sizes: medium, large, extra large, double extra large. [air horn rings] So, I want to see how much the biggest-size cup I could get at the 7-Eleven is. And to do that, I will need, hang on ... It's just past 40. It's exactly 48 ounces. That's hardly double extra. I'll round it up, 'cause of this section here. I'll round it up to 50. 7-Eleven also at one point offered a size that was even bigger, called the Team Gulp, which, again, according to them, was 128 fluid ounces for your team, 'cause who doesn't like to, after a softball game, go to 7-Eleven, get a Team Gulp and 10 straws? You know, just kick it with the boys, right? Come on, team. Yeah, right. That's for one person, don't be ridiculous. Here are many, many, many 7-Eleven items you can get in the US you can't get in Japan. And here are many of the 7-Eleven items exclusive to Japan. Japan puts the \"convenience\" in the convenience store. We call it konbini, which is the abbreviation of the convenience store, and it makes our life a lot easier. For example, office workers rely on stores like 7-Eleven for food and drink to keep them happy so that they can be productive at work. And for students, they tend to buy juices and snacks and hot foods, instant noodles, you know. And when I was a kid, I would often eat hot foods and instant noodles with my friends and with my ex-girlfriends. 7-Eleven memories. And for families, there is pretty much every daily essential they may need. And also you can pay your bills, get ticket reservations for music and sports, 7-Eleven even has its own bank and ATMs. No matter where you go, especially in big cities like Tokyo, you can find more than one konbini on every block. Yeah, it's a bit different here in the US. I do frequent 7-Eleven, and it's not bad, but the vibe is more kind of like get the thing you need and go. The food is usually pretty hit or miss, usually miss in my experience. The hot food looks like it's been sitting out for a while, so I usually don't get it. Since there are way too many items exclusive to Japan for us to buy for one episode, so I've curated some of my favorites for you guys. This is still a ton of food. So, here we have Japanese onigiris. This one is plum, tuna mayonnaise, shrimp and mayonnaise, mentaiko, which is spicy cod roe. I picked these onigiris from the back, because onigiri in the back are fresh of all time. And let me show you how to open this one. Just pull this over till here ... Like this, so that you can have the dried seaweed. Itadakimasu. Mm, a little bit sweet, a little bit of sour. So, here is our sushi. Look at this huge salmon sushi. Ah! Gorgeous. Gorgeous sushi. Itadakimasu. Oh, my God, this is so delicious. Mm. Osushi! We've got this long natto roll. Personally, I love natto. But even Japanese people, 50% of them like it, 50% of them don't like it. This is an acquired taste. So, after this sticky and smelly natto roll, I've got sushi roll special package. So when it comes to this one, it's called oinarisan. It has rice inside, and the skin is a sweet tofu skin. Mm! I'll admit, oinarisan umai wa. This is so good. So, my grandma always cooked this for me. And this makes me happy all the time. And next to oinarisan, this gorgeous sushi roll, it's like Japanese version of California roll. Itadakimasu. Wah! 1,000% better than California roll. Kanpyo maki. In English it's, like, dried-gourd roll. Itadakimasu. Perfect sushi roll. And last one, we have pickles, radish pickles. It's quite yellow. It definitely has yellow No. 5. Itadakimasu. I'm gonna give them Grammy award. And standing ovation. Ah, the hot food at a 7-Eleven in the US. We got a lot of options, not as many as Japan. I'm not quite sure what some of this stuff is just by looking at it, so let me go down the list. Nachos. They're the self-service nachos, so they have the chips ready to go, and then you just open them up and add cheese and chili onto them. Ugh. No, thank you. Over here, these mini tacos. Man, these look really, like ... I bit my face. Oh, man. They've been sitting for a while, so I'll forgive them. We also have wings, crispy and not so crispy. Pocket bean burrito guy. Look at that. Over here in the roller-taquito section, you can get a barbecue bacon cheeseburger roller, spicy garlic roller, regular taquito, Korean barbecue taquito. Also, we have chicken sandwiches, a black bean burger, glazed cheesy barbecue meatballs. Also at our 7-Elevens, you can get a pepperoni pizza, cheese, or seven-meat. And also for hot dogs, we got an exclusive hot picante dog. No. So, here are our hot food sections. We've got steamed buns. It's got pork and bamboo shoots. And this is really standard nikuman. So, next size up, we have the doubled nikuman. And next one, this little guy. What is this? Sweet beans steamed bun. And last steamed bun is pizza bun. You really are the pizza! Delicious. So, all these things, like, around 100 yen to 200 yen or so. So if you're broke, you should definitely try this. We've got these ones. This one is called curry pan. So deep-fried curry bread. I wanna eat it. I wanna eat this! I wanna eat this right now! Itadakimasu! Holy moly. Um, it's freaking delicious. And next one, croquette. So it's basically got potato and pork mince. And last hot food we've got is corn dog. So, this one right here is a pretty Japanese-y one. It's got ketchup and mustard, and you just squeeze this one onto this one. All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go! In Japan, we have these chicken options. First, I'm going to start with this one, karaage-bo. So, in Japan, when you make Japanese fried chicken, you put some soy sauce on it. So it has soy-sauce flavor and also garlic flavor. It's so freaking delicious. So, this karaage-bo, it's got one, two, three, and four karaages. We have fried chicken, spicy fried chicken, chicken nuggets. Hot sandwich, the Buffalo-style chicken slider. The cheeseburger and the bacon cheeseburger. Look, I mean, can you even tell which one's, right, which one? Huh? I'm assuming, obviously, this burger's been cooked. More on this in the ingredients section. 7-Eleven in the US, and I think probably here in Southern California, has tacos and burritos. Get yourself a chicken fajita taco, al pastor taco. Bet this one's good. And a chorizo breakfast taco. The spicy beef, bean, and cheese burrito. This ain't any burrito, baby. It's The Bomb. Bombing out the toilet, good God. You're getting this and you're microwaving it there. So if you're, like, walking out the 7-Eleven chomping on The Bomb, like, better make it home in time. 'Cause oh, man, it's coming. Empanadas, right? Yuelei: Yeah. I don't want this. I'm gonna go ahead and put this in here and then close the lid like it's a coffin. Go away forever. All right, so here are my favorite bentos. Let's take a look at this one. It's called nori bento. This one is a pretty popular one in Japan. So it's got croquette, a deep-fried fish cake, fried fish with tartar sauce. Kinpira gobo. It's like Japanese traditional salad. Pickles. And as you can see right here, it's got spicy cod roe. Under this seaweed, it's got rice and fish flakes. I love this bento. Like, when I was a student, I think I would eat this every single day. So, after my favorite one, this one. Look at this! So this one is a Korean-style beef bento. Oh, man, smells so good. Whoo! Everything right here is so amazing. Fantastic. This is so mashisoyo. Tonkatsu bento, and it comes with this sauce for this tonkatsu. Look how thick it is. So, outside from bentos, we have soba, soba noodle. Put this sauce first. Put wasabi and dried seaweed. And then you put water onto soba noodle. It's getting moist. And don't forget to put green onions right here. Itadakimasu. So you put soba noodle in this box. [slurping] Umai! I guarantee you can't stop eating this, 'cause it's so delicious. Sorry I slurped the noodles. Because Japanese people or Asian people do make noises when you eat noodles. We slurp. Slurp! Slurp right now! They got the meals over there in Japan. We got meals too, like this ready-made ricotta-, Romano-, and Parmesan-cheese-stuffed ravioli topped with marinara sauce and mozzarella. Ugh. Just stop, stop doing this. Stop, please. Stop. Oden. So, oden is like Japanese traditional hot pot. It's got fish cake, fried tofu, noodle thing. This is made from potato. Egg, radish. In winter, when you eat this, this warms you up, from your heart. To your body. And next, gratin doria. So, obviously it's got meat sauce and a lot of cheese. Under this cheese, it's got a lot of rice in there. It's like Japanese Western food. We have 7-Premium main dishes. Naan and butter chicken curry. And next we have 7-Premium side dishes. Mackerel, grilled mackerel. We also have mackerel in miso. Saba miso is [chef's kiss]. Smoked tongue. In Japan, it's a pretty popular item, especially when you go to a Japanese barbecue restaurant, we order the beef tongue or pig tongue. So this one used to be like this. Smells so good. So fancy. It's marvelous. So, after this sexy tongue, we have sexy fish cake. And look at this bar. It's a chicken bar, so it's like a chicken nugget before it's fried. Octopus and wasabi. This is just raw octopus. Kinpira gobo. It's saut\u00e9ed burdock. Hijikini, stewed hijiki seaweed. And potato salad. So, when I go home, my mom always cooks this one, this one, this one. I love you, Mom. I miss Mom's cooking. And next we have Premium Gold main dishes. Shrimp with chili sauce. Beef stew. Hamburg steak. Sandwiches, 7-Eleven. Egg salad. Peanut butter and jelly. Turkey and cheddar cheese on a kaiser roll. So, we have the Italian-style sub, but then we also got The Italian Job. Turkey and ham with, is that cheese in the picture there? We got the smoked turkey and Monterey Jack cheese sandwich, and they separated the lettuce, so you add it right before you're ready to eat, so it's still nice and crisp. Salads, chicken Caesar salad. We also have a pepperoni pasta salad. So, here are my favorite sandwiches. It's got tuna right here and cheese and lettuce. And the rest of these are ham and egg. I thought this is normal, but you don't have this one, fruit sandwich. So it's got a whole bunch of fruits. It's got peach, pineapples, and oranges on whipped cream. So it's like cake. So, here is 7-Premium drip coffee. So I'm going to make myself a cup of coffee. Heyo! And he just sits on here. Ah! Ah ah ah! Ah! Mm. All right. Itadakimasu. It tastes like shit. So, for breakfast sandwiches at 7-Eleven, you can get yourself a croissant with ham, egg, and cheese. Ooh, an English muffin with bacon, egg, and cheese. We also have English muffins with sausage, egg, and cheese, sausage biscuits, and sausage, egg, and cheese croissants. The 7-Eleven signature brand also has mini doughnuts, chocolate, cinnamon, crunch, and, of course, powdered. Madeleines. 7-Eleven has cookies right at the register for a dollar. You can get yourself some macadamia nut cookies, oatmeal raisin, sugar, but there's also a chocolate chip cookie one. Baked goods, you get yourself some muffins. This is a blueberry muffin. Coffee cake. Crispy rice treat bar. Notice it doesn't say Rice Krispie, 'cause you know that's copywritten. Walnut fudge brownie, bear claw Danish, iced honey bun, cheese Danish, mixed berry Danish, glazed honey bun. I got these prepackaged, it says \"flavored snack pie.\" That's a weird way of putting it. Lemon, key lime, banana cream. I feel like they used the same -- that's the same. That's Photoshop right there, buddy. Boston cream, apple, and the last one, strawberry cheesecake. Key lime. Look at all that cream in there. It's key limey. Oh, yeah. Oatmeal! That's obviously maple syrup right there. But the first thing I did when I looked at it, I was like, \"Wait, does this have brandy in it?\" Boozy oatmeal. You can put hot water in here, Joe. Or hot milk, Yuelei. Or hot whiskey. Your boss won't notice the difference. Well, at first. Here we have Japanese type of bread. Stir-fried-noodles-and-sauce bread. We call it yakisoba pan. Now, you may be thinking what the [dolphin chirps] is this? So, it's like hot dog, but instead of sausage, we've got stir-fried noodle inside. Carb, carb. It makes you fat. Bread makes you fat?! So, kids love this noodle and bread. Itadakimasu. Mm! This one reminds me of my childhood, me playing tags in the mountain and chasing the girls. Now a lot of girls chasing me. This is a crab bread. It's got two crab-shaped bread. Now, the question is, does it taste like crab? It doesn't taste like crab. Taste like just bread. Pink bread. It's a cherry-blossom-flavored-coating bread. This pink stuff is, it's pretty sour. It tastes like cherry blossom and like my first kiss. This is the salty, savory snack zone. Ah, so much stuff. And I've hit the \"Food Wars\" wall. Hot and spicy cracklin curls, the original, and the fried pork rinds, chili lime. I'm not tasting anything pork-related to it. Little pig guy there. Little piggy guy. You're on the menu, buddy. Next, 7-Selects has their own veggie straws. This will be the trail mix and mix-like section. We got these cheese-pizza-flavored snack mix. You're gonna be a stinky boy if you have a bunch of these. Now they got the spicy ranch flavor mix. And this last one, just sesame sticks. For those of you who like to get your trail mix or your Chex Mix and then unmix them and organize them and eat them like that, 7-Eleven has got the snack for you. Oh, this is kind of a party snack mix. Eh. This is what I would totally get, yogurt pretzels. They put yogurt on there, and, like, you're thinking, \"Oh, yogurt, that's healthy, right?\" I mean, it's just, it's the same as icing. Now, you're looking at this going, \"Jack Link's beef jerky? That's not a 7-Eleven brand.\" No, it's not. But as you can see, exclusive 7-Eleven flavors. See, this was like, \"Hey, Jack Link's, guess what? We're about to push you out of our shelf space. So do a deal with us, or you're gone completely.\" And Jack Link's was like, \"No, I've got kids to feed, please!\" Brown sugar bourbon, original recipe, original. Hickory-smoked bacon. Like snacking on cheese and nothing else? Full house, baby. This one is mozzarella cheese wrapped in hard salami. Pepper Jack stick, Gouda cheese to go. Oh, the big one, the big cheese, the white cheddar. This ain't your grandma's cheese. It's the big one. Just two. Cheddar cheese. Colby-Jack, which is like camouflage cheese. Ugh! Pretzels. Mini twists, non yogurted. Pretzel nuggets. Ooh, gross. These ones have peanut butter inside of them. Pretzel sticks. I feel like there was a while there in the early '90s when they were like, \"Chips are bad for you. Eat pretzels instead.\" And these are really salty, too. A serving size of these is three. I would get this assuming I'm gonna sit and eat this whole bag in one sitting. I'm not gonna do three at a time. The whole bag is 1,160 milligrams, 50% of your sodium intake. Mini rice cakes. Chips. 7-Eleven has a bunch of their own potato chips, including the original, fiery hot. Kettle chips, which are way better than regular chips, again. Spicy jalape\u00f1o, smoked Gouda. Ooh, Gouda. Barbecue, salt and pepper. Ruffles rip-offs. We got cheddar and sour cream. Prime rib, I'm trying these. And Buffalo chicken dip. Prime rib? Woof, smells terrible. Oh, my God, that was so bad! It's definitely not this. Yeah, more like ground beef. And instead of one of these fancy forks, there'd be the plastic spork that they have at 7-Eleven. They're opening the bag with the spork, meat's pouring out of it, it's on the floor of a 7-Eleven, with a guy mopping around it. Nuts, baby. Nuts. The rise and shine fiber blend of a trail mix, whatever. Antioxidant. Yeah, right. Revive and thrive, another antioxidant mix. Should've just handed these out during COVID, would've bounced back in a week. Cashew halves. You like your nuts halved? Booyah. You like your nuts wholed? Booyah. Does it matter if they're whole or not? Would that affect the flavor at all? Who cares? Spicy ranch pistachios. And, of course, jumbo flavored wasabi and soy nuts. Nope. Wasabi will never touch my lips again after that video. So, here are my favorite instant noodles. Let's start. Ippudo ramen. Man, I love this. So, it's got some packets. Dried pork. It's a miso for the ramen soup. Dried veggies. And it's got noodles. All right. And you've got to wait for three minutes. So while I'm waiting for this, I'm gonna go this one. So it's called Ippei-chan. So it basically is a yakisoba. Yakisoba is like Japanese stir-fried noodles. So, you put some hot water until this line. All right, so it's been three minutes. Put this soup into this bowl. Mix it. Smells so good! Bravo. So, Ippudo has a lot of locations in Japan, including Tokyo, but this taste, this flavor is totally the same as the restaurant's serving. So just get it at 7-Eleven. Oh, shit, I totally forgot the, oh. So, I put some hot water, but -- oh, shit! I should have thrown the water away into the toilet. Gomen ne, noodles. Let's make yakisoba. [laughs] The volume of these noodles gets a lot bigger. OK, so put yakisoba sauce. And flakes. And most importantly, mayo. Mayo beam! Oh! And mix it up. Ta-da! So, this is yakisoba. We usually eat this, like, at summer festival. Pretty good, as always. Next, we have tako-meshi. Look at this. So, it's got green onions, and I believe this is tako. So, three minutes again. Look at this final noodle. It says ultra-spicy final. You're going to be crying because of the spiciness. It's too spicy. But I'm going to try this, only for shooting purpose. This is for you guys! We can do it. Clip: Never give up! Oh, man, I'm so scared. All right, so I think it's time to eat this one. So, I'm going to throw the water away in the toilet again. Let's go to the toilet. And put yakisoba sauce. All righty. And the taste itself is lighter than this one. I prefer this one, but, but, this is the king ramen. All right, so finally let's make the freaking spicy noodle. I call it death sauce. In case I'm dead, please find another Japanese host. It was nice to meet you, Food Insider. Go! Oh, man, look at this. It's not red, it's blood. I don't want to eat this. [coughing] Ah! Oh. Ah! I'm not joking, I'm not joking. Ah, ah. It hurts! Am I alive? Am I not dead? Am I in heaven? Hell? I feel like I'm in hell. It's not all junk food at the 7-Eleven, Joe and Yuelei. They also have delicious freshly sliced fruit. Prepackaged and everything, came straight from the ground, and it comes in a container that will be here until the sun explodes. This, I mean, this has to be an LA thing. You can get mango with tajin seasoning. Automated voice: Tajin. Fantastic combination. Finally, grape cup. 7-Eleven also has its own brand of packaged candies. Sour gummy bears, sour neon gummy worms, sour watermelon wedges, green apple rings, gummy worms for catching gummy fish. Heh-heh. You like that? Fruit leather, whatever we call this. Chili mango. Hell yeah, I'm trying these. Sweetened mango, and a sweetened fruit medley. Not bad. Oh, a little spicier that I thought, whoa. There's also gummy bears and gummy sharks. There's also gummy peach rings. They got jelly beans, and they got sour cherries. 7-Eleven Selects in the US also has their own line of sandwich cookies. Vanilla, pumpkin spice, double chocolate, peppermint, s'mores, the duplexes, lemon cr\u00e8me. Mm-mm-mm. So, here are Japanese sweets. Pink rice cake with red bean paste. So basically it's like cherry blossom mochi. Itadakimasu. Mm, mm. I want to eat this under the tree of cherry blossom. Cherry blossom, pew. Next, we have ninja gummy. He's like ninja salaryman. So, it's a hard gummy. It's really tough, like stones. [crunching] Toppo. It's like Pocky, but the chocolate is inside. I'm loving it. Look at this cute guy! Koala no Machi. Koala's March Chocolate. My favorite would be this one. When I was a kid, I would eat this every single day. And this taste is so nostalgic. Oh, little George is calling me like, \"Hey, I wanna eat this! I wanna eat -- \" Hey! We are filming right now. Later, after shooting, OK? \"OK.\" OK. We're good. Pudding. Please prepare the plate. And you just do like this. One, two, three, go. The shape is like cherry blossom. Look how jelly it is. Mm! This is the best pudding ever. We had to go on a run to get more stuff. That's why visually this all doesn't connect. 7-Eleven's got macarons, French macarons. Ooh, mini cheesecakes, New York style and strawberry swirl. These I can get behind. Our 7-Eleven in the US has ice cream, such as banana cream pie, caramel butter pecan, chocolate-covered strawberry, double cookie dough, cookies 'n' cream, sea-salt caramel, strawberry-banana shortcake. So, let's start with cold stuff. We've got fried dumplings. It's frozen. Frozen takoyaki, frozen fried rice. So, after these frozen meals, I got ice cream. Choco Monaka Jumbo. So, Choco Monaka Jumbo is like Japanese ice cream sandwich. Ah! Let me bite. Itadakimasu. Sorry, it looks gross. [laughs] So it's got ice cream, and it's got chocolate in the middle, and this crunchy on the outside. Every Japanese people get this one at least once in their life. And last ice cream, I got this one. Gorilla chocolate ice cream. [laughs] I don't know what this is. Ah. Ah! Ch-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t! Ah, sorry! Itadakimasu! This is delicious. Not only me, but Gorilla would love this. Lot of exclusive drinks. I don't know really where to begin, so I kind of lined them up by perception of healthiness. So, all the way down on this end, we've got 7-Eleven Select Go Smart cold organic pressed juices. This one's the tropical glow. And this gross-looking one is, of course, clean and green. After that, we got these prepackaged juices. These are the 7-Select Farmer's Grove. Cranberry cocktail, raspberry lemonade, orange juice, of course, regular lemonade. Then next up in the bigger ones we have the 7-Eleven teas. Peach black tea, sweet tea. They weren't kidding, man, look at that. Lemon sweet tea and green tea. Fruit punch, mango, guava. Energy, come on, herbal tonic. Herbal? This is herbal, guys? Yeah? 7-Eleven also their own brand of ... are these considered energy drinks? The Gatorades and Powerades and the like. So Replenish, and of course Replenish zero. I'm assuming zero added sugar. Orange mango, fruit punch, lemonade. The cherry is clear. What? Why is cherry clear? Guava splash, orange mango. \u266a These are bad \u266a 7-Eleven energy. \"Strawberry lemonade energy shot, one and half times the caffeine of a cup of coffee.\" Oh, good God. Undrinkable. How bad does it have to taste where this is too -- I couldn't get to this? You've seen this show, right? You'll see what I'll tolerate. This, I can barely tolerate this. Here's something that they don't have in Japan. They don't have Slurpees. That's nuts, right? Slurpees are -- how do you describe a Slurpee? It's like a flavored slush. We have endless Slurpee flavors. The ones currently you can get here in America are blue rocketberry, blood orange, Vitaminwater XXX, blue raspberry, blueberry lemonade bliss, cherry, Coca-Cola, Mountain Dew citrus, peach perfect, pi\u00f1a colada, and pineapple whip. So, here are Japanese exclusive drinks. We have vegetable juice, of course. Mm! Oishii. A lot of Japanese salarymen drink this one every morning to get their day started. So this one is for Joe. Joe, you're missing a lot of veggies, so you should drink this one. Oi Ocha, my favorite green tea. And these two are hot drinks, black coffee and caf\u00e9 latte. And this is our first time filming this. We have alcohol. We have 7-Premium beer. And this one is not beer. It's like Sprite with alcohol. It contains 9% of alcohol. It's pretty delicious, but at the same time, it's pretty dangerous. Japanese sake. When you come to Japan, you can see a lot of people drinking alcohol outside. They're like [groans]. They are not dead, they're just sleeping. They're drunk. Whisky. 7-Eleven in the US has its own private brand wines, Yosemite Road, Trojan Horse, Plot and Point, and Voyager Point. It also has its own canned wine brand, called Roamer. Perhaps the reason 7-Eleven has such a wide variety of products in Japan is that it's everywhere in Japan. There are 21,215 stores in Japan. That's crazy! Which is nearly 30% of all the 7-Elevens in the world. Of course, all 37 prefectures have a 7-Eleven. And out of all of them, the city of Tokyo has the most locations, with 2,850. To put that in perspective, the US has 9,417 7-Elevens, and there's no 7-Elevens in 18 states. As far as states, California has the most, 1,823. But as far as denseness in area, Las Vegas, Nevada, has the most, with 158. In Japan, our hot dog is 290 calories and 720 milligrams of sodium, which is 31.3% of your daily allowance. Our hot dog is 180 calories. Ooh. How about this? Our hot dog is 180 calories, but for the frank only. The stats, for some reason, don't say anything about the bun. But this isn't much better for you. It's 570 milligrams of sodium, so around 24.8% of your daily allowance. Japan's hand-rolled tuna and mayo onigiri has 258 calories and is very filling. Remember this guy? The tuna sandwich. Here in the US, ours is 420 calories and lots of sodium, over 800 milligrams. Fuck! And in the US, a Super Big Gulp of Coca-Cola, this isn't Coca-Cola, is 44 fluid ounces. It's 513 calories and 143 grams of carbs. That's over half your daily intake. In Japan, 7-Eleven does not disclose the ingredients list of its freshly made food items. It does, however, tell us the country of origin for the raw materials for certain items, like the fried food, yakitori, oden, and Chinese steamed buns. The chicken for our fried chicken is from Thailand. The pork for our sausages and hot dogs comes from USA, Canada, and Japan. The wheat for the buns comes from Canada, the USA, and Japan. And adzuki beans come from Canada, cheese comes from New Zealand, and the shrimp for the shrimp chili buns is from Vietnam. This is the pepperoni pizza in the US. And it contains all this junk. I mean, what's this thing? Never heard of that. What about chicken strips? It's got all this stuff! Just like mom used to make. And, of course, the 7-Eleven Select cheeseburger, which contains ... [sighs] sesame seed bun has enriched flour, excuse me, enriched wheat flour, wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, monoserititate, serotitititate, calcium propionate as a preservative, calcium sulfate, royal beef patty got smoke flavor added, and it's beef, encapsulated salt, potassium ... Is anything else after that? Salt, spice, pasteurized process American cheese. Ah, cheese -- they're sitting down. That's how long this is going. My cameraperson just sat down. A preservative, paprika, and annatto color. So I guess the last takeaway from this video is that in the US, some of our 7-Eleven items can be a little bit of a gamble with your health. Speaking of gambling, you know your boy got some scratchers when he was over at 7-Eleven. Mm-hmm, OK. So there's the winning numbers. OK, so we didn't win anything on that one. I have no clue how to do this. Did I win? If you haven't subscribed yet, subscribe now! 'Cause we were filming this for six hours."

      "corpus": "a place will not come in here alone it scared him they won't come back historic Harriman Hospital drawing and tourists paranormal investigators even Hollywood film Crews the old historic cameraman Hospital set empty for about 10 years Harriman hospital is one of probably the most active and haunted locations I have ever been in Travel Channel filmed an episode of destination fear here it's just amazing the amount of activity that's going on in that building you can [Music] all right so Tiffany and I are at the main entrance I want to welcome you guys to the old historic Cameron hospital hospital was built in 1938 opened in 39 to the public so far we know of has been added on three times one in 1953 this part four floors this was open in 1991-92 and the hospital eventually closed down in 2013. it's been unoperational since 2013 so it's been 10 years a lot of activity here lots of activity not very many people have come to make videos here though so this is going to be a lot of fun I have had some friends make some videos here exploring with Josh was in the same location he showed me this footage before he even released it on YouTube but he had a tripod right up prove it so look how the tripod standing nothing's moving it nothing's shaking it you know we're all moving around he's sitting down nothing's like making it fall off for no reason boom close right down and kicks it it goes Tiffany she's joining me on this adventure tonight I'm gonna tell you right now we got a tour of this place I experienced some stuff just on the tour so I'm really excited but at the same time I'm really scared yeah let's start out with this though okay I really hope it does not knock over this tripod because I would be really upset a smaller tripod is pretty sturdy I would say it's a lot sturdier than if you have it up high is there any Spirits here that want to communicate using my tripod maybe you want to knock it over so yeah it was crazy because wasn't it the security camera that caught like that getting knocked over I think it was that security camera right yeah there's a lot of cameras like there's one like right there there's cameras set up throughout the entire right the entire building so the owner Ronnie he was interested in purchasing this place and there's a whole story behind it because they were sharing it with us earlier on our tour and he likes to go and visit a place that is supposed to be haunted to see if it for sure is haunted he was with four other guys and let me just say this that what he caught made him buy this place on the spot because it was super haunted it was almost like the spirits were letting them know like yes you must buy this place the very first time we came here they saw him first and then they said there was somebody in in the hallway so we went down there and went running through the through the little area and doors were closing and everything and we chased them into an area where there's only one way in one one way out and the door shut we went in and there was no one in there five of us guys chased whatever it was in there but never saw anything so they ended up chasing a spirit some they thought it was somebody and they chased them and I'm going to take you to that location here in the hospital in a little bit but that was terrifying so as we're walking around we're gonna kind of keep an eye on that tripod to see if it gets knocked over if it does we do have a security camera hopefully they can share some of that footage with us can you knock over that tripod for us that's good I do a lot of exploring if you didn't know I have a farm also known as The Safe Haven Ranch and I ditched my boots as soon as I got these fresh shoes right here by Bessie they are the only shoes in my opinion that are not only comfortable but waterproof they keep my feet warm and they keep my feet cool as soon as you put them on it's like a nice snug sock and after a little while after wearing them for probably a couple days or it's almost like they conform to the Natural shape of your feet if you live in a snowy climate too I don't I live in Florida however I do get mud on my boots a lot and these guys are perfect easy to clean I step in a lot of my cows sometimes and all I do is I just take a water hose to them I could rinse them off with some soap and water check out the vessies and the other styles at vesti.com forward slash omargosh TV get your vessi sneakers and the size you want now using promo code Omar gosh TV for 15 off your entire order there's noises happening all around us right now so yeah I wanted to give this massive shout out to Bessie for sponsoring today's amazing video let's keep exploring this is fun we're gonna just kind of walk around we may come back and check on that tripod a little bit later but we were down this Hall earlier with one of the docents actually a couple of them and I saw what looked like a man standing here and this is something that they see a lot in fact this place is that haunted that even the police when they were doing their trainings here were so scared that they don't want to come back in here I wanted the police officers noticed somebody in a window on the first floor we pulled up at four in the morning he said were you over there and we said no so we had to go with him so we're turning on Breakers and looking for bad guys and it turned out when it was done now with it had to have been a spirit there was nobody here and the place will not come in here alone they have been in here so many times alone it scared them they won't come back fire department has already said that that if the building catches on fire it's going to burn like they're not coming no they're not coming in no they'll roast marshmallows outside but they won't come in somebody gets caught in here trespassing or whatever like they're not coming inside of this building they're that scared they're going to wait until you come out they're going to get you there's cameras all around here but yeah they're they're not going to be coming inside here is that a little watermelon I can't see because it looks like a ball I don't have a light so I can't oh well I can actually see on the on the camera yeah it in person that's wild it'd be crazy if we hear that tripod knock over like oh my God that'd be so cool no this is definitely one of those places where we got to keep our eyes open because you're gonna catch a lot there's a lot of Shadow activity uh not just shadow people that people see too like they see actual people like walking through here I mean this is a very active hospital at one point it's a very large Hospital wasn't this the morgue at one point yeah that's what they ended up making this okay Logan please wash hands quiet Please be aware of others so they turned it into an exam room later on and this was a morgue now the owner Ronnie how what was that I don't know oh no I'm not foreign that's outside okay so a lot of equipment came from a nursing home and it's like where all these chairs came from a lot of the hospital beds was wasn't it like they were it's donated or something um I think he went and bought them from oh he bought them I think so oh wow aren't you creepy This was um a waiting room at one point right and they have it set up still like a waiting room agree I look I was standing what is that about right here I don't know I keep hearing something but that's where I seen a man he was standing straight ahead in that room right over there oh you want to do like an on a loan challenge later no I'm okay I think so why not but would you hear that it sounded like Footprints right yeah foreign it doesn't look old I mean 10 years is a long time but you know they've really taken really good care of this place and kept it pretty clean definitely let me know if you guys see anything because there may be a lot that I Miss Tiffany misses oh this is the hallway where he's seen a hand right right over there she said a hand came out like that and she saw a hand and she took a deep breath come out and told us and we came in here with her it was just three of us in here so there's things you need to watch for when you come in here because this is newly open this used to be open when the police department was here and the fire department was here there was power to the hospital the doors are magnetic so from this end all the way down block long the doors would be open and that's where you can look and see people move in Shadow Hall can you show your hand again oh [Laughter] gosh we heard you all right I'm gonna use this brand new app and I don't believe it's out yet it's called necrometer I'm still beta testing it the same makers behind necrophonic created this app very similar to like the spirit talker app but I kind of feel like you get a little bit better responses with this and it's a little creepier we like creepy we like that scary scary so when did that happen that happened recently right [Music] all right we're gonna try to find out what it was that was creeping its hand on the other side we would love to see that again and catch that on camera but if we can't do you have anything to say it just said my name oh it's a semi ninja set my freaking name wait how did okay now I'm like I'm wait how does it know to say like I I don't I don't know I don't know I don't know these Spirits they can manipulate whatever they want how do you know his name how do you know my name I didn't introduce myself I mean you do be loud okay I don't think I even mentioned my name though so how do you know my name my name is Omar so you know I'm gonna introduce myself my name is Omar this is Tiffany I know we're in your space right now and we thank you for that break break I have heard that you need a break because a lot of people have been visiting the Harriman Hospital lately and sometimes y'all can get agitated but we're here respectfully we don't mean no harm we just George yes you will yes you will all right yes you will see George now this is one place where you don't want to antagonize Spirits you don't want to call them demons there's no demons here I mean some may argue that there could be things that could hurt you here nope yeah see if there's a grumpy old man that was crossed over into death and he doesn't like people he could probably not like people as a ghost too so it doesn't mean that he's a demon doesn't mean that you know he's evil he's just a grumpy old man that's not saying that things can't hurt you so you have to be respectful when you come to a place like this and that should be respectful when you go anywhere anywhere but especially a place like this because there is a lot what was that I don't know there's a lot of activity here we're going to explore a little bit more if you want to show your hands you can show your hands infect oh okay don't forget your battery I mean oh shut it what was the first word um wrong wrong shut it I'll leave you leave you okay so maybe we should walk out of here well this is where that that hand would okay oh this is a did they do like CT scans

o'clock right 11 o'clock or wow yeah good point and this would be one o'clock so this is another part to the hospital that they're going to eventually open up there's a lot to see here but they're still working on it they're trying to make it safe for everybody to come and visit when they come electricity there is no electricity yeah there is no electricity yeah so this is the way that takes us to the other area okay vulgar vulgar says vulgar um if we go up here and go to the left this is where she said a lot of activity happens over here bro what was that what I don't know it just sounded like there was somebody walking over there hello this is the hallway where they said that they seen a man and a hospital gown running all the way around and they chased them yeah into that room over

grandmother on the third floor okay it's a room like that though yeah was this triage like what was this is where if you needed anything you came over here and oh this is where you can knock sometimes you'll hear knocks because that's how you alerted the nurse that you needed them if there's a little kid standing at the end of that hallway right now can you do a knot for me that sound like it came from here dude it was a knock so you're a lot closer to us what I saw earlier came from down there where are you at now oh look another operating room oh there's a sterilizing that's another there's two of the sterilizing machines and this is there's one of them right here okay dude I heard that all right let's not be scared bet you this makes a amazing espresso foreign little kid are you in here did you die in this operating room no oh don't say that I mean it's a simple question wow sad that had been if a little kid died in here and they just probably wanted their mommy stop wow that's really sad just the empathetic side of me Tiffany's a mommy I knew where you were going please don't it's very she wants a hug can you stop why do you do that come touch Tiffany no come touch Omar he's the one that wants it why are you why don't stop doing that don't play with her hair she likes getting her hair do you like me coming on these things with you don't do that are you trying to say you want to walk around here alone I know where the exit is do you no okay well I might be in here alone sleek all right I want to go back to where I've seen that little kid that's to the right dude I'm telling you was wearing a striped shirt I mean it could have been a little girl too goes straight ahead goes right at the end of this hallway oh wait a minute isn't this where they said they chased that yeah it is actually they said actually if we sit here on this bench we can probably catch some things so look they went into this room and they chased this figure I mean I could have the story wrong no this was it and it's like it disappeared there's no windows over here or any doors that lead to outside this is called the Blue Room mm-hmm oh that's what it was she said if you sit down the hallway like down by the nurse's station then you can hear things coming from in here you can hear things but she said once you're in here if they stop oh I'm scared dude it was right here is that a kid's wheelchair where right here Daddy oh I i j I just looked at that and I was like wow that's really little and then it just dawned on me I wonder if that belonged to like a little kid I'm telling you there was a little kid standing right here so this here was the whoa that was cold what simple that was just really cold it was just really cold right here so this here was the um recovery room and this is where you would go and stay before you went home and then oh after your operations right did you hear that yeah another knock all right I have an idea little kid I saw you at the end of the hallway you were wearing a striped shirt weren't you was that you that made that knock guess where I am oh um can you give us a hint give me a hint I I mean I don't know they're asking I I would say right behind Tiffany around the corner is that where you're at maybe you're standing right next to Tiffany why does it always have to be me if you're a little kid why don't you go and grab her hand you're literally gonna make this my last one hold your hand out hold your hand out you're a dad did you keep forgetting that you're a parent too I know but kids like their moms more than their dads I mean you know my kids wanted me when it was time to like play and like play video games and rough house and I mean I was a cuddly dad though like kids want their moms when they're in the hospital and they're sick or not feeling well I don't know my kids wanted me to you want to reach out and grab my hand s well I could tell that this isn't the same ghost that I was speaking to earlier because they knew my name well that was on a completely different floor yes it was on the first floor right and there's a lot of spirits here supposedly my name is Omar nice to meet you this is Tiffany what's your name would you like for me to hold my hand out again I feel like this is probably dangerous yeah it is because you're like offering yourself so you should probably stop okay you got kind of quiet the children are heard the children are heard are we going to hear the children that'd be kind of cool the others scare me oh the others scare me is that like the child a child talking maybe or is it the living that's scary I don't know that's a good question is it the living that scare you are there others in here that scare you maybe others that aren't friendly really like to know what scares you the nurse is there a mean nurse Among Us I had a love-hate relationship with nurses when I was a kid I was a sick kid and there was always like these friendly beautiful young nurses that would check on me as a kid when I was in the hospital and there was these meanies kind of Grouchy and they'd like give you shots and stuff maybe that's what it is maybe you just don't like the nurse because she's going to give you a shot is that what it is that what you want to watch the woman scares me oh the woman scares me well a nurse is a woman I mean not all I mean not all nurses are women but I mean what is it okay I could have taken this a haunted house or a haunted prison it says it's saying nurse like we're in a hospital it's stuff that actually relates to the location that we're at right now can you tell me more about the woman that scares you or why she scares you you wanna hear look at what's crazy okay look I know this is so random but look what just came through on my notification no look from TMZ a nurse was snorkeling when a 220 pound like a nurse what are the odds that we're getting a nurse on the Spirit Box and then I get it a notification from tnz about a nurse tnz TMZ I mean that's just I don't know it's just weird this is the area that was kind of creeping me out [Music] that's wild girl this isn't that's what we're in this is insane like how look [Music] this is the way up if you wanted to go let's keep going that way I think this is a dead end yeah there's nothing down there are you sure yeah it's just like some more rooms all right where should we go should we go straight or should we go upstairs what's up with the doctor um it's just interesting yeah I'll go upstairs yeah you know what we didn't go to the basement I don't think we're supposed to go down there the woman scares me oh it's seeing that again the woman scares me what woman I've never heard it repeat the same thing like that no me either is the woman up here yo you know it was terrifying I don't know I heard like a Tapper it was like a loud bang down there was that the woman but you know it really terrified me it's very nasty here oh I thought that they were doing a good job cleaning up maybe they liked it maybe it was before they were yeah it's very nasty here what's so nasty why do I not remember this I don't know this is the third floor yeah how many floors oh I do remember okay yeah this is actually where what's your name Rhonda yeah okay so Rhonda was actually a patient here all right remember and this is where she was the heart um what does she call it the heart Ward yeah I think so bro there's noises all around us down there the basement or down here maybe down there why down where look at this like this is this is an old hospital room I just the children sing the children sing okay can the children sing for us right now I want to hear the children sing I wonder what he was trying to tell us not to go down hmm so don't go down there well you did talk about the basement and yeah maybe that's what it was yo I will have to say this though Colby Sammy Colby yeah they were here visiting not long ago is there anything you want to tell Colby all right so like this Spirit just a minute ago said don't go down there I'm gonna put I'm gonna put Spirit talker back on so you didn't give me a reason why we shouldn't go down there I mean is it too late for us now everything everything during my nfpl icism what the freak is going on right now ncaqx Johnny might just watch an ifbbq jkfhgcrg kg turn it off stop touching my phone please can you step away from the phone please vxjqn srk TV on look at vqnd and com QC rdtr jdc I I don't know I don't know it's this I've never had that happen ing it's literally off bro what I've heard never like it's when I asked it about oh my god I've never had that happen before yo I'm scared bro maybe we should go to a different part all right wait I I'm I'm really curious if that's gonna do that again okay what I just heard something over there what is this look what oh okay foreign what just happened right now dude I've never ever experienced anything like that it's almost like it got a hold of the app and just like it I hate to use that word possessed but yeah that was wild like what did it do it's it's like it manipulated in a way that and nothing was popping up which is crazy and you try to turn it off yeah and it was still going footsteps that's I'm going to ask again why shouldn't we have gone down here what's that device so you can talk into this device if you want to tell us something this is a phone it's a mobile phone you're probably used to like I don't know if you know what a phone is but at one time there were rotary they were connected to a line that sounded like a car I hope so but it didn't sound like a car because it would you would you would have kept hearing it where was that picture taken where it was like the burn victim at the end of the hallway it was on the third floor are we on the third floor yes we're on the third floor yeah how do I don't remember how to get back to it did you not want to talk to us anymore yeah no it's like so quiet yeah bro that was bizarre yeah that was pretty wild I've never had like I'm so glad we had the cameras on we use this throughout our whole that whole series remember and it never did that 16 different people using the spirit talker app that was a car guess where I am uh oh we played this game earlier uh I'm gonna guess behind this door right here am I right [Music] I'm sorry a little closer than I thought are you in there oh I'm upset you're upset okay why are you upset are you upset with us please stay back okay maybe don't go to that door we were kind of warned not to go somewhere down here was it down here though or was it down in the basement maybe that'll tell us oh there is something it's doing it again I turned it off we're not going this way because clearly it doesn't want us to okay maybe he was trying to get our attention to go back over here though I don't know it said stay back and then we start walking that way okay hold on it said don't go down there we started walking this way and then we start going down there and it's doing it again so maybe let's not go that way [Music] [Music] that's wild [Music] we got one more floor to go and then there's we haven't even been to the other side of the hospital yet I know doesn't it connect through up here do they go up here let's go maybe that's an attic or something what is that I just heard that yeah we'll just walk towards the noise that's what we're here for all right well let's go in there first no no this is your thing this is one place I would not go alone no definitely not too bad we didn't have this in the series I know oh so I forgot to mention the dude that owns this Hospital owns probably one of the scariest oh God hospitals that I've been in look that way yeah oh let's get the out of you didn't it yeah I thought there was somebody standing there so we gotta go this way so this is what it looks like when a hospital has all the lights off yeah isn't this the Burn Unit I think so I could be wrong oh yeah just oh I shook her hand earlier yeah okay come on but yeah Old South Pittsburg Hospital the guy owns this now this is like two hours away from there it's a little bit more south towards Chattanooga it's another waiting room um not because I feel anything evil here but it's just there's so much activity here and I think there's some conflicting spirits what what was that I don't know did you hear that was it okay it was like a Mumble there's no conflicting Spirits maybe that was something trying to correct you with that okay sorry if I said that and you didn't like it something on the Spirit Box did tell us it was like the woman scares me maybe he was talking about the heck sounds like there's somebody back there this was kind of nice somebody put it was like Christmas card was it Christmas cards in every room to invite them to a party I don't know if were they inviting The Ghosts no it was the patients that were here oh the patients yeah or like all the patients from the hospital when the hospital was when it was open okay right that was nice I think we're kind of lost I remember walking through here I just don't remember like where to go look how cool it is look at these rooms and apparently this is like the original hospital beds so you know what I have to say too with the vessi shoes they're very silent yeah when you're walking to but they're very comfy Okay so oh hello is that the way down I think it is like to the other area maybe but it sounded like something's coming from this room right here sounded like it was coming from the stairs to me oh so this is the icy okay this is ICU ICU and the reason why I remember is because all of the rooms had windows and had curtains because the nurses had to keep an eye on the patients oh now some parts of this Hospital are a little bit older than others like I mentioned earlier the front part that we were at where we have that tripod was built in the 90s and then some other parts were built what in the 1950s oh and I did forget to mention this too it's almost like this land was cursed from the beginning before this hospital was even built 1929 Harriman saw like one of the worst disasters ever a massive flood and lots of people died and then to top it off part of the hospital was a hotel at one point and that was on fire oh I don't I don't remember going down these stairs and didn't it burn down the hotel across the street did look oh be just maybe the wind from up there Maybe yeah I don't remember walking down these stairs either let's go down together okay you're technically going first you're taking forever to come okay ow I put my head on that wall uh oh no let's go see wait isn't this the floor that we were supposed to not be on I don't think so foreign wait this is the operating room again no wait where is this I don't know where this is we haven't been in here yet right I don't think so okay a lot of hospital rooms they have furniture in every room that's so cool and all that came from although there's something in here what like a ball oh it's a balloon or balloon okay is that Mike Wazowski one-eyed monster yes Mike Wazowski yeah I don't know it's like a dinosaur or something can you move that balloon for me whoever's up here if there's anybody I'll wait for it to go still I'll ask again it could even be lightly like a light tap maybe there's nobody in here okay well if there is anybody in here thank you anyways so that's the thing is like there is a lot of Souls here you know so I mean it's it's nothing demonic but there's just so much wait a minute this is where we were is it is it well we just this is where we weren't supposed to go wait what we just went in a circle we were supposed to go this way why did we do wait so we went down this okay yeah so then let's go back to okay remember this is where our yeah this is where we were earlier sorry for going down here we're literally going in circles foreign I think this is the stairs we went down to we went wait a minute we went uh oh but then we went down again right okay so we went in a circle we went we went this way and then we went around so let's go down here and then maybe go back to that other floor yeah all right we should go check on the tripod okay I don't remember how to even get back to that so what was the story that Rhonda was telling us about this girl that was antagonizing like a spirit and then like her backpack got through she was in the lobby and I guess she was here for like some type of like public event or something like that and she was in the lobby antagonizing a spirit and it was caught on their security footage here and it just picked up her book bag and like tossed it and they caught that on the security camera and supposedly they don't like that if you antagonize the spirits here and they won't let you come back you shouldn't be antagonizing anything anyway I mean seriously like I'm surprised that's all that Spirit through and whatever Spirits here we are here respectfully we're not here to antagonize you who's this we're just here to tell your story I don't we know that you have a voice that's where the little kid that's where I saw the little kid okay so this is the second floor okay so we go down one more okay right I think I wonder if this hospital has tunnels it is freezing down here so this is the first floor okay okay yeah we're back here's the lobby oh we got to go this way I know but then you want to check on the tripod you said yeah all right we just did a little circle but that's still there other end of the hospital we're gonna go to in a second I didn't get pushed over or anything nope so what do you think so far dude that thing like making our device go off like crazy like that I'm not gonna call it a thing but I mean just I I've never had that happen before like I manipulated it and not only once twice twice in the same area yeah I have to say that's probably been the most terrifying thing so far yeah well and like just the constant Footprints and like footsteps all the sounds yeah just because something is scary or terrifying does not mean that it's demonic or bad or evil or bad or evil I mean the unknown can be scary to most people I mean for me like I know that there's nothing in here that is going to harm me physically I mean of course it's possibility if you're mean and you antagonize the spirit is a possibility however it's not anything that is demonic in my opinion it's still scary though you know I mean like seeing like a dark shadow figure from far away is is pretty scary some people come in here just for like little events for like a couple minutes and they can I mean look the cops the cops are so scared they don't even want to come in here it's not because there's demons here is this because it's the fear of the unknown you know it's like they know that there's something here and it's scary three that's scary for some people and for some other people like some of you watching at home right now I mean even even for me even for Tiffany it's fascinating like the stuff we were hearing upstairs the stuff that was happening to us like with our device like yeah it was kind of creepy but it was cool like the cops had seen somebody from in the window on the Upper Floor or something like that there was somebody in the window and the cops called Rhonda ended up having to come here they asked her they were like is somebody there are you there and she was like no so she had to come here with the cops to search the entire premises and apparently cops were like with their guns and there was nobody here and they were like yeah we're not coming in here anymore like you're so pretty babe I love you I love you I'm glad you joined me on these Adventures I know it's not easy bro if you keep trying to volunteer my body parts and stuff I'm not volunteering your body parts are you not touch her hair cut touch her leg give her a hug okay goes come touch your butt out of you come touch your butt stop it right now she got a big juicy butt like you want me to continue on these adventures with you stop I'm glad that the tripod is in place I think it's the nurse she's like keeping an eye on it for us all right cool okay well let's so we have to go back this way then right and there's a lot more to see that way all right let's go so I had some microphones die so I'm gonna be using the built-in microphone for now well I mean you know it's a like a shotgun mic we also have these mics that are for the the iPhone 14 pro that we're using so yeah we're uh we're improvising sometimes it's good to have some backups but a lot of times in previous videos a lot of you are like you should definitely put like a GoPro or something behind you and I listened because y'all said this so many times so I'm gonna attach these these are like police body cameras and I use them a lot sometimes I'll put them in corners and stuff and and have them as like a security camera they're very durable waterproof I'm gonna put one on Tiffany's back right here okay it'll be hanging like so I'm gonna have one on my back too because we're gonna be shining some light in front of us but behind us is going to be pure Darkness these are infrared and they'll be able to see in the dark a little bit later tonight it'll be probably the last thing we do we're gonna turn off all the lights and we are just going to use these cameras in pure Darkness what else did she say about being alone that it's not safe supposedly the spirits will like kind of mess with you more so you can do that and I'll hang out in here come on like this place is cool I'm pretty sure if we rewind the footage you're like this is a place right never go alone oh that looks good all right I got your back babe I mean you know this thing has your back now you can see it's seeing in the dark pretty good already whoa that's cool all right little cameras behind us so this is the part of the hospital we have not been yet oh okay and you make it off right there's a huge hallway where they see all those oh there it is right there that's one of them yeah that's the hallway so supposedly spirits will sometimes Peak their heads so this is the area where she said to stay in the middle because the doors will slam and she said to stay in the middle because that way you know you didn't touch it okay oh like don't get near the doors yeah didn't somebody like go running out of here because the doors were slamming on them well apparently there was a paranormal um couple and it was like they had just recently started investigating and I guess when they did it the doors separated them too and the husband was like really freaking out was he really so this is the nursery area let me know if you see anything peeking its head around the corner if you see a hand or anything oh I just noticed this oh is this like a little another Nursery area now I know Rondo yeah so Rhonda was saying she was born here she was in this room this was like the nursery and they brought in some like bassinets but that's the original oh this is an original yes like oh wow okay that's pretty cool that baby looks really real too we just started moving see I think it's so cool that she was born here and her kids were born it's really neat are there any baby Spirits in here oh don't say that that would be really sad maybe we can get a little a little cry no that's horrible I want to know what it is I'm really curious as to what is closing these doors because there's not one window open can you close the door for us I was just like a it's like another all right I'm going to demonstrate my hospital stays when I was a kid I would usually be like right here and a bed and I'd ask the nurse can you bring me a bucket I need a book it right now I had a really bad stomach issue when I was a kid I still do yeah but I mean it was worse when I was a kid like really bad supposedly I was super lactose intolerant and I didn't know that I was allergic to milk and I was drinking this milk I don't know if that's what led to me having stomach ulcers when I was a kid but I had stomach ulcers I had a rough like six I was like I was a really sick kid yeah I was uh I spent a lot of time in the hospital as a kid like they did one of those endoscopies like two or three times to see what was wrong with my stomach that was milk are you scared we shouldn't be okay you're not scared tactics remember that show no oh yeah I do remember no I do I remember now that with Tracy Morgan yeah hmm oh look at those old terrazzo floors our schools used to have those yeah well if we like go around the corner and you see like a zombie feeding on somebody I don't know that's just what I was picturing right now you guys are awfully quiet this evening I don't know why is this chair tipped over uh you know what I saw that earlier when we came in here you did or when we walked by yeah should I pick it up no okay oh maybe it's holding up that whatever that is oh okay yeah so it's meant to be that way you can tell that this is like the older Park yeah of the hospital the original right yeah these Christmas cards are everywhere yeah they invited that was nice yep okay so this is the mental health area and this is where that old woman's room is remember one thing that's creepy about here at the Harriman hospital is these long hallways yeah and every single one of those long hallways people have seen apparitions but this was that old ladies room oh yeah if you want to go in here I remember feeling like there was like an elderly attachment here and I wonder if it has anything to do with it even has the golf ball like the nursing home Rhonda was I guess doing like a Spirit box or something in here and I know it wasn't a Spirit Box it was the EVP session with like a recorder and there was a spirit in here that did not want her to leave do you want us to leave nothing I don't think so oh and this is the door that supposedly is like really loud oh and I should take a picture right there because she said that commercial oh that's the where the burn victim yeah right here is where the hotel burnt down so that that was be even before the hospital opened so kind of you know people have said you know the movie crew people I smell flash uh people died in that fire yeah there were people that perished in the fire people that got burnt I do have a picture on my phone that glass right there when you're taking pictures and you got that window stand to the side because you don't want your reflection in it you got a moment to see it yes this was caught here and it was it was exciting I didn't see it my friend from Indiana saw it and he he was afraid he was going to scare me and freak me out and I said no please show me and he sent it to me so are you sure you're okay and I said yeah so when he showed it to me I thought it was just absolutely cool and several of the girls that work here I shared the picture with them now look in that window that little window you're gonna barely see somebody on the right side now we're gonna flip it you see I'm even better don't you oh wow now you'll see what you look like we kind of thought he looked like a burn victim but several say they think he looks like a clown well it's just like he has bandages this is off my cell phone I'm doing a video and he caught this bill Nolan hey Bill I know you're out there you're going to be watching this that's what it looked like blown up yeah that it looks like there's like bandages around yeah like a bandage or something and I was down here eight in the morning doing a video for Leanne and I'm here by myself and you look where I'm at you know you go from all the way over at the other end of the street and I'm doing a video for her and he I sent it to him because I wanted to see what we opened and this is what he came back with so dude that picture is scary but you have to get out of the way so it doesn't okay go ahead take some pictures there's something definitely cool to do during an investigation just take lots of photos you could do them with or without your flash and you'll be surprised what you can catch yeah let's get a little closer a Little Closer all right let's come over here on this way so you're not in there oh we're in the area where the hotel burned yeah and people have smelled flesh yeah move out of the way so you're not in the room in the reflection I'll look at those in a little bit this is the door that makes a particular noise that they say should be on TV let's see if [Music] we'll see if they do it [Music] it's not doing it she was saying that it wasn't working all of a sudden [Music] kind of oh [Music] gosh oh foreign [Music] so I guess this right here hold on let me close it first we're not locked down are we it's not this one I don't remember what it is here we have to go through this door here okay oh gosh it's dark oh man where does this take us I don't know we haven't been here yet okay we can't go that way oh wait we have been in here oh this is the this is the okay so this is where her grandma her grandmother died okay right there and then this is the nurses station where um when the nurse passed away she said that she was still going to come back here and I guess people have actually like caught her multiple times here oh the nurse I wonder if that's what the little Spirit the kid Spirit was saying like I said something about a nurse and it said that they're scared of her yeah but from what we hear she's not this way so her grandma died in this room yes her grandmother passed away when she was like 12. so she never Rhonda never met her grandmother right so she said the room used to have six people in it and she had her mother come here to show her exactly which room it was but it's changed since then but this was the room what her grandmother's name was which now it's I guess utility Rhonda's grandma no don't do that I'm just saying like we're sorry about what happened to you hope you're resting in Paradise and making occasional visits here and there they did a really good job cleaning this place oh yeah Ronnie did an amazing job yeah it's a really nice Hospital I've been to a couple being in hospitals in my day and they do not keep them up very I mean this place is so clean there's no electricity here but there's electricity downstairs in the in the lobby the lobby right like there's like some electricity but in these areas didn't they say something about the elevators like going ding and when there was no electricity on them and some of them were dinging I'm lost Hospital entrance so I think it's lost that way have you ever been in a hospital and like you get lost in an actual Hospital yeah I mean we're in an actual house that way and see if we can find that's one of those hallways huh yeah well let's walk down it okay let's see if anything looks familiar what is this oh these are frogs oh this is where she said if you sit outside the room this is the room where the guy was getting sucked in oh the gray yeah yeah so if listen so oh gosh that just scared me listen do you hear those yeah she said so if you sit out there you can hear that and you hear that then you know somebody's in here okay so Rhonda was down the hall I think was it no it wasn't Ronda it was somebody else was it it was oh no it was two girls it was two other girls yeah they said they walked by seen a man in there that looked like he was being sucked into something and he was like vacuumed he was getting like sucked in and it was right here I wonder if that has anything to do with the hotel that caught fire what are some things that would like suck you in I mean not necessarily a fire the flood oh like a Whirlpool yeah we'll flowed from 1929 supposedly like all the streets here I mean we're in downtown Harriman right now and just about every building here is haunted he says like the whole entire she's like you could literally go outside and do a Spirit Box and like get all types of right like right outside the hospital interesting hopefully my camera on my back catches that guy in the gray oh my God I'd be so terrifying to see later like when you're editing I'm just gonna stand right here for a second okay so that's the place where she said there is a kid's toy for us to make sure we always have a light so where did we go out at is there an exit right here no so where's the exit because we didn't walk all the way this way down no we didn't bro this hospital is huge didn't they say it was like what three blocks or something yeah see we can't go out these doors yeah that probably goes to the other part of the hospital so now we just have to find I'll just see a person walk over there wait what like well in the other building over there a lady just walked by oh that's part of the hospital isn't it wait that is there's nobody here that's part of the hospital I think so you saw a lady yeah please tell me you're recording please don't pray who the heck's gonna walk by at 2 30 in the morning [Music] are you sure you saw a lady yeah I'm positive yeah that's the hospital that's the other side of the hospital there's no ladies here well why where is that light on is that the lobby or something I think so I'm telling you that's the very front all right well then let's go to the front and see what we can find how many people you think diving this Hospital oh well she said it's not even just the hospital it's right yeah wait I felt did I film this when we walked by I don't know we had to okay looks like it lost wait that goes up we're lost there's a big place it's really big I think that's the only way all right well then let's go back up and then okay okay so confusing it is pretty confusing yeah we're kind of Awesome we got a tour earlier and we remember them taking us this way so there has to be a way out yeah I'm still tripping out about that Spirit Box yeah Okay so then we're gonna have to go this way we gotta go back and we're gonna have to find a door I'm telling you I think this is where we went when we left yeah so which one of these door because these are closed can't go through there can't go through there it's right through here and then we go up yeah I'm pretty sure this is the part of the video that we're going to do something extremely stupid what but not stupid it's gonna be cool I'm running out of SD card space on this camera so just spit it the hell out because like I'm already annoyed with you now we're gonna roll in the dark even though the lady told us not to okay I think we know our way around though sure we do let's go okay fam so we are in complete darkness the little bit of light that we can see is just like reflecting off of like these little lights that we have on our microphone and some ambient light it's throughout the hospital for safety that they use for little nightlights right so I mean I can't really see much where are you at I'm holding on to you all right oh my God I'm scared walking through this hallway before this song pops out shut up I don't know how you sign me up for this hey we do it for the thrill of it oh God it's so dark you know what I do for the thrill of it eat a couple slices of pizza and hope that I don't gain weight okay look this is way darker for us than it is for you oh there's something straight ahead boy if you don't I'm serious okay can we just see something why are we going towards it because this is the way out [Music] maybe it's not the way we should go oh my gosh my light thingy just went off so I can't even see now oh my just push the button I think it's this way to the left yeah this is the way up oh there's something down there okay I don't care yo it's dark isn't there like a staircase we're supposed to take uh maybe I think there was supposed to be a staircase um you wanna yeah we're gonna need some type of light because hold on where's my there I got the flashlight right here all right we cheated a little bit broke out a little bit of lighting is this it yeah well we had to because like we're going down a staircase okay yo I was legit lost though I know it was scary oh this place is so big there's so much to explore huh you know um not to knock on paranormal investigators because a lot of them are great and they're good at what they do but I feel if you're a Paranormal Investigator and you come to a large place like this you're almost cheating yourself out of a great investigation by staying in one room and just staying in the dark and asking questions and I mean there's nothing wrong with that but I think you could catch a lot more just going around and exploring and just maybe spending times in different areas and just like we got to cover this entire Place honestly I don't think we got to cover this entire place I mean there's places that are still kind of closed off of course and I we got lost a few times so there was a lot of places we did miss too however I feel like we may have caught some stuff that we wouldn't have if we just stayed put in one particular place and we did have fun staying in a couple different places too and doing the Spirit Box and whatnot but I don't know what was your favorite part honestly I don't know there was I think the most intense part was when the Spirit Box started going crazy when we were at that nurse's station yeah that was because we heard a bang we heard footsteps we heard the Spirit Box go I don't know that whole area was just like it freaked me out yeah I freaked me out too I'm hearing something behind me I know I keep looking back there on this night vision thing and I don't got my glasses yet so I keep thinking I'm saying something but my glasses didn't come in yet I'm telling you when we were walking down that hallway then you were like no we got to go there and we gotta gotta make a left I saw something at the end of that hallway well maybe if you had your thing facing it then hopefully uh maybe this camera caught it but I saw it with my eyes I mean your eyes adjust in the dark but of course they're not going to be as good as a night camera you know with infrared but I don't know I feel like I saw something they see that they catch stuff during the day too yeah during the daytime Devin and I were here Devin saw an apparition running down that way somebody in Scrubs looking straight ahead and run the only difference was there was a gray tent yeah this is one of those places big shout out to Tiffany for joining me on it a big shout out to the staff here at the Harriman Hospital amazing people Ronnie Ronda my boy Heath Leanne amazing people they don't get paid for this kind of stuff they do it for the pure love of the Paranormal and of the history here in Harriman if you come here to visit this amazingly haunted hospital make sure you tell them that Omar and Tiffany stay here gotta go for now before we leave laughs [Applause] [Applause] [Music]"

video thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign get all sorts of seafood rice bowls there's oysters there's king crab all you can eat snow crab or all you can eat any crab on this list let's do that [Music] this is really interesting first dish they brought over a giant tempura King Crab Claw squeeze of lemon looks like some pink Himalayan salt on the side this is a heavy heavy claw whoa this is dry so well you can pretty much eat that shell that is one of the most succulent tender chunk of king crab I've ever been into you can see already how juicy this is delight and pour a crunchy shell on the outside absolutely perfect a little dunk into the salt oh my gosh this thing is crunchy as tender it's just one of the sweetest things from the ocean you can put in your mouth again I never had king crabs and pearl like just before I'm gonna grilled plate of king crab just right in front of me let me finish this first this is incredible by the way a little salt all you need oh these are starting to smell really good around here by the way this is breakfast grilled king crab giant plate of I think boiled snow crab before I get into these two plates of crab they also brought over I think this is a snow crab sashimi it's my first time having snow crab Sashimi I tried king crab Sashimi before snow crab one might be more tender I mean this thing is just melting your mouth pure pure oceany sweetness hmm so soft and gentle I gotta find out those two things the tempura king crab and the Sashimi snow crab I gotta find out if that's all you can eat but let me get cracking on these crab legs and crab is grilled you can smell that awesome Briny charred Aroma just by being near this plate gonna give you some pretty hardcore scissors to cut the king crab with these are ginormous chunks of king crab all right picture of this deserves to be hung on the fridge oh my gosh this is better than any king crab you'll find in a Vegas buffet first of all it's real salt all that naturally sweet flavor of the crab that just accentuated by the grilling process you got the nice smokiness of the grill as well on the crab this is about as sweet as a crap as you can get I mean the crab here looks incredibly fresh so apparently this company is also a crab wholesaler unless you're eating a live King Crab it's about as fresh you're gonna get precise the sweetness there's also a burst of juice which you're pretty much tasting the sweetest part of the ocean It's gotta be careful operating these scissors I have a little soy sauce and wasabi but you don't need to dip this into anything I mean you really don't need to dip this anything but they do have butter available I like just a spray of lemon that's so perfect I know this place is in a very touristy area I'm packing let's genuinely tell you this is amazing next up let's dig into a snow crab oh yeah [Music] [Music] foreign does seem a little dry no but it can crab is great I mean it's still good but definitely a little dry as I was eating the snow crab they just brought over the hairy crab this is really a tasting of crap from around the world so this is taken apart so you'll have all that delicious meat there and then on the inside look at that they kept all that delicious flavor crab Essence inside the crab that is the Miso that is the best part of the crab that's why it's hidden all the way in these Chambers that's your treasure this seems like it's really fresh be careful this is kind of stabby as well oh break that open look at all that juicy sweet succulent meat oh that means it's not as sweet as the king or the snow crab is way more tender and if you want more flavor in this thing take some of that meat take some of that nice delicious miso put it on top of the crab meat so you're essentially seasoning this crab that bite might be better than a king crab this is one of my favorite crafts to eat in Japan because the inners of this crap the flavor is so rich creamy and deep it's basically the crabs flavor Essence and when you put that on top of the sweet crab meat it's like a taste budget just went for a swim in the ocean in the best way possible and this crab is definitely Super Fresh the meat from the joints this is actually some of the sweetest most tender meat and it's right by the dipping source so just go ahead and dunk into some of that miso holy moly crab eating it doesn't get much better than that what's also really cool is that they have an array of dipping sauces and sauce that you use to kind of keep it crabby Adventure more interesting and hot butter I always like to squeeze some lemon into that always just sew in all whenever I open up a king crab leg at this giant sweet piece of meat this time a little butter meets Ultra buttery this is actually a really nice Buffet I mean besides the snow crab if you told me the king crab and the hairy crab was still alive about 10 minutes ago I believe you [Music] just not many things in this world more beautiful than that I love it so much that they give you fresh Wasabi to you with your crab let's try something Wasabi and hot butter tip some king crab in there that is not a crabby combo fresh Wasabi is not nearly as spicy as the neon green stuff that looks like et's blood that you find in the tube and that sharpness is even more balanced out by the butter so it's buttery with a little Wasabi jab to go with that sweet king crab that's not bad anyway that buffet was 10 000 Yen each so about 70 US dollars for or you can eat snow King and Harry crap that's not a bad deal for the quality of the crab especially when along the streets of tsukiji you can probably get like three king crab pieces for 2 000 Yen so the buffet is a much better deal the thing with crab though not very filling already hungry as soon as I turned the corner on this alley this curry place right here it's got a line out the door I love hole in the world Curry shops they usually get into give you a cup of water and a little coffee foreign foreign it's probably the thickest Japanese Curry I've ever had it's really creamy almost as if like potato was already somehow mixed into the Curry on the top crisp looking concert and of course this whole thing just filled with minced meat [Music] Su insanely crispy on the Outside Inside very very tender and right now the heat of the curry is starting to hit me so a little iced coffee brings the heat down a little bit overall flavor is a really cheap and spicy and scrumptious definitely the thickest curry in the land more like a very thick grape the rice is really fragrant as well whether you're talking texture flavor overall Aroma of the dish miss wonderful oh there's a super Hefty portion about five US Dollars honestly the coffee it goes really well with the curry before leaving jambucha I really wanted to try this place out this we don't place look at the line at 3 P.M that's not even lunch time we're dinner time someone said that don't be intimidated by the lying because it's always a long line they move really really quickly gotta be honest a little intimidated that's a really long line I can imagine what lunch rush and dinner Russia look like and why wait teach ice cream from ministop oh that's ice cream any chance I get to eat at a convenience store in Japan I do it and this thing I think it has some like Peach caramelized sugar on top so ice cream is Sublime with some Peach puree I think on Top This is better than 99 ice cream I've had in my life if you see this ice cream at mini stop in Japan you gotta try this this is mind-blowing just got inside the wind wasn't that bad it took about 15 minutes got the beef though oh this broth is ridiculous so this thing tons of fatty and thin sliced beef tons of scallions of some garlic I put some pepper on here as well all right my beef is so tender that's super just pure flavor I'm gonna change the Dashi and the fattiness of the beef and I don't know what else they did with this I made it so magical I think a slurp of noodles which are nice and firm and chewy all right I'll definitely come here and get this I love this so much I got a second bowl and this one is pure beauty look at all those Centric lines on this thing some scallions on top it looks like a gentle windless Pawn on a cool windless summer day where everything's just perfectly still and beautiful broth um I feel like the last dish I like the broth more than the noodles banana noodles are chewy they are not nearly as chewy as these These are super springy I feel like Spiderman can use these to shoot out of his web shooter it's so elasticy and smooth the ramen is 100 the best part of this dish also at 500 yen there's about three dollars more delicious udon yeah this place has a line for a reason it's definitely worth a try nothing Wild on the menu everything's just executed perfectly I've never been in Japan during cherry blossom season before that's really beautiful I think I'm just gonna buy some snacks and sit here rest of the day seriously smells so nice as always I'll place a win to list it down below for you guys thank you all so much for watching until we eat again"

      "corpus": "one year ago I began studying Spanish for one main reason and that was to enable me to one day visit Venezuela and see for myself what life is like here well I've just flown into the country into Caracas an hour ago I'm totally on my own but I'm ready to explore I've already found a mosaic what comes to mind when you hear the name Venezuela probably not very positive images and that is not surprising Venezuela has an image problem brought on by a seemingly endless crisis that has seen its economy contract at an astronomical rate but it wasn't always like that in Venezuela in the past it had a thriving economy built on oil and its capital Caracas was the most modern and wealthy in Latin America and so I traveled all the way from Peru over Andes mountains along Amazon River to finally reach a country I'd always dreamed of visiting and to see how things were now was Venezuela really as bad as its image and more importantly would it ever be able to relive its past glories now I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little bit nervous we all know Venezuela's reputation for criminality and unlike every other YouTuber that has been here I'm totally on my own I've got no contacts I've got no contacts no friends no knowledge so um let's see it's bloody noisy let's see if I can survive the streets of Caracas on my own probably not too Fair IES we stumbled upon the Gordon Ramsay of Caracas Senora is anyone else seeing this [Applause] Venezuelan there we go we're into it now we're already into it we're into the string of things we've met our first [Music] it's not as dangerous as they say Sushi see they're a friendly bunch here in Venezuela [Music] wow Amigo okay okay wow the sad thing is Venezuela used to be one of the richest countries in the world that's hard to believe right Concord used to fly from Paris direct to Caracas but that was a long time ago and things have gone downhill and so the people now of the country have been reduced to selling some belongings here on the streets of Caracas wow what a place it is but I feel safe the people are friendly for God's sakes I hope [Music] he's singing me a slow romantic song I want something with energy so I can move so I can share my skills okay I'm paying you not to sing any more enough [Laughter] crikey that was the worst singing I've ever heard [Music] but a policy that is really taking place here in Venezuela there's a soup kitchen here people queuing up and a lot of old people bringing cups and all classic bottles cut in half so eat some food restaurants [Music] so there he goes these people are feeding the poor elements of society here in Caracas and it looks delicious in fact I might come back later and get your big food difficult times difficult times in Venezuela despite the fact it's sitting on top of billions of barrels of oil Edition s [Music] again Anton says wow [Music] wow so okay Clara so the guy was telling me I believe that it's safe up here in the barrier that we're about to go to so I'm going to show you something there and it's safe because it's not controlled by the police it's controlled by the people of the Barrio [Music] um architos Uno Uno vamos a man who's caught us on his motorbike he's going to take me to the top of the hill okay Suzuki [Applause] foreign [Music] well we've come to the very very noisy Barrio January 23. named after the day when democracy finally came to Venezuela back in the 50s but we've gone to see the statue of commandante Hugo Chavez let's move away from the music it's a little bit too louder let's move away Chavez was an incredibly charismatic man and he was elected and then re-elected by venezuelas well the poor and the downtrodden who in reality we're sick of being ignored by Venezuela's corrupt leaders high oil prices help Chavez run social programs into Barrios he nationalized the oil industry to help do this and for a long while things went very well until they didn't and here we've crossed the street and look what's here we've got the church of Saint Hugo Chavez look at it dios con Nosotros God is with us and who is against us and this picture of Jesus along with Hugo Chavez as you can see here where that kind of represents how some of the people are locked not but some of the people in Venezuela equate Hugo Chavez kind of as a kind of jesus-like figure helping the poor of Venezuela it's a bit more complicated than that but anyway here we are Santo Ugo Chavez Del 23 Barrio 23. do that in English [Music] [Music] well we've left the noisy part of the Barrio because I saw just down the road at some well pretty awesome street art check these places out look at this the sort of the sort of street art you see in all socialist countries here's one that says eterno Eternal commandante Venezuela Hugo Chavez look at it crikey and then on this side of this building here we've got a picture of Che Guevara check it out and then over here we've got one more of Presidente Chavez Chavez Bieber check this one out look at it Chavez Viva wow what an interesting place this is and um so far I'm liking Venezuela I've only been here about two hours but I like it let's have a little walk through the area where people live see what it's like down here where did Venezuelans actually live I'll tell you what they do like they do like a potted plant on their balcony let's see what it's like through here a little chilled piece of Caracas IO piece of crackers and look people look after their Gardens maybe grow a few veg few coconuts people hanging their washing out it's like italystas gracias gracias and Caracas is it always so we've come into a little Community Center here in the barrier here in the Barrio 23 and I suppose this is where they run education programs teach people things organize security before we were told that in this part the people run the security of the Barrios and here you can see so I'm writing I don't know what's going on and probably that's why they were Keen to like ask me what I was doing because they're in charge of the situation here they're running it making sure everything's safe and Gente so yeah so he's confirming that here the people control the barrier so that it's safe oh Manchester United Manchester United [Music] ah there we go we had a little tour of the little commune of um 23 January 23 right let's get out of here let's get out of here and head to other areas probably a lot more dodgy that was fun well we're walking down out of the Barrio and the truth is as I said before I don't know anyone I've got no knowledge about this bloody place I've got no contacts I'm on my own there's no one with me which means I don't know where I'm walking and if where I'm walking is going to be a really dodgy area I might just stumble into the worst part of Venezuela or Caracas anyway I feel okay feels good let's walk down head to another part of town mucho estas you do see all of the crackers lots of American cars in different states a little bit in a sense a bit like Cuba because in the past I mean there was a lot of American workers here America brought a lot of money here into the infrastructure because of the oil industry Venezuela has the most the most proven reserves of oil in the entire world more than Saudi Arabia more than Russia unfortunately it has no bloody idea how to manage that oil industry which is why instead of looking like Moscow probably Riyadh Caracas looks a bit run down whoa another American Truck vamos hola someone says [Music] yeah you see you trans sanctioned Venezuela impossible Coca-Cola look have you got Samba in your country hey yo who's this behind me okay guys on the motorbike aqui Venezuela in Venezuela same Coca-Cola problemos 500 meal wow okay battle usted Battle Is Dead boy races in Venezuela here in Venezuela you have two currencies you have the local currency bolivanos named after Simon Bolivar and you have dollars a lot of people use dollars and so sometimes you pay in dollars but if they don't have change they give you change in their money I can't show I've only got two bloody hands but anyway that's what happens you have to accept the old bolivanos which you don't really want you'd rather have dollars in your pocket anyway let's continue who section [Applause] you don't see that on Hove High Street [Music] [Applause] all right claro oh yeah I'll go wow I've discovered a little shop under a Motorway flyover let's have a look at it this is how people are surviving wow look at it this is how people make money here in Venezuela they just sell things wherever they can find basically and here under the flyover they set up a shop selling children's toys magazines functions we're off so he finds them from different people and stuff it's a little bit similar to the one that we found in Bogota [Music] biblicals wow maybe I should buy this for the melandros Para malandros s [Laughter] okay Clara oh no that's your sketch oh you know a cuantos anos wow eight annuals [Music] okay into the Santa oh I see so you've got some awards wow I don't know what he got this for but um pretty cool hey architect Architects see so this guy's an architect but he has a shot under a bridge situations he's disappeared into the hole the black hole of the bridge wow wow so he's an architect literally living under a bridge that's his house under there see you soon this is foreign [Music] that's the situation in here in Venezuela you can be a highly educated man An Architect no less and still you're forced to live under a bridge and sell pieces of crap that probably no one's ever going to buy sad however we can't blame all the poverty in Venezuela solely on government is management the US has sanctioned Venezuela's oil industry thus denying the country billions in foreign revenue and my own government the UK is stolen tons of Venezuela's gold which is being held in British Banks and who suffers from such actions that's right the people of Venezuela just like the people of Syria do and the people of Iran well you're disappointed aren't you this is all too safe for you not what you expected of Venezuela if you want danger and preferably some big old titties well I can't promise titties on the Eastern edge of Caracas is South America's biggest barrier and Venezuela's most dangerous it's called petari let's go and check it out now before we go to patare I want to buy something something that's going to give me protection and there's a shop up here that sells exactly what we need these shops or this shop here sells deities they're a kind of a pseudo Venezuelan religion that people believe bring the owners who have a bison Fortune luck safety which is very important in Venezuela and some of these statues depicts real-life melandros from the Barrios foreign [Music] in the 1960s he was a cop killer and um yeah so this is one of the most popular statues Ishmael [Music] and he looks just like me we bought our lucky Saint malandro Miguel so I think now we can go to patare and everything will be okay he'll look after me now truth be told I'm not the first YouTuber to visit in all honesty I've seen about three or four others go there before me the difference is however they all had local guides offering both knowledge and protection me however I'm just jumping on a bus and turning up sake we have a wrapper on the bus [Music] this is we've arrived with Miguel let's um let's hope everything goes okay well myself and Miguel have made it to the main square of patari the old Square named after

petara used to be a town it was it was founded by Farmers from the Canary Islands in fact it's a similar climate here to the Canary Islands and so everyone is staring at me I've never been so nervous anyway yeah that's it but it's not a town anymore it got so big that it kind of got encapsulated into Caracas and here we are being stared at by the entire town of patara do you speak English no why not you like Mr beasts okay YouTuber and Venezuela in Venezuela Mr Beast you've got fans here in Caracas okay [Applause] well this part of Qatari is nothing like I expected it's just like an old Colonial little Spanish Town and um yeah it's kind of better than the center of the city even this is the part obviously that was first founded by the people from um the Canary Islands as I said before and um yeah wow I'm being followed by school kids everywhere I go I'm going up on a register if I'm not careful hola como estas it was wow she's saying walk around and don't be afraid just do what you want it's very safe here let's see okay gracias well the guy there has told me that the part of bitari that I'm looking for the dodgy part is kind of up here and somewhere else so um let's go

check out this statue maybe it's a statue of melandro look at it well it's not a malandro it is Jesus it's the Jesus of Pizzaria look at it Plaza Sagrado the Heart of Jesus of potato look at him that's Jesus folks Jesus will protect me and so will Miguel Kontos right let's find a motor taxi hola Moto taxi quiero senor your boys [Music] oh go ahead we're going with a female motorcycle driver how is she gonna protect me Amiga [Music] okay right then we're on board we're going up high into the dodgy Barrio let's check it out there thank you we've stopped off halfway up the hill to the top of potato let me take my house off and you can just see these basically homemade houses I mean every home is homemade but still look at these old brick houses just thrown up by people people who have moved from all over Venezuela to Qatari this kind of illegally built barrier and there's some petarian people up there hello hello I didn't see them at first wow look at this and they run illegal electricity lines into their houses they don't pay bills wow look at it and down there we've got a big old football pitch and a swimming pool who expected that into the Santa so we've stopped off in

so far yeah people are friendly yeah I was real we're finally with with upsiders right okay yeah I think other people from other parts of Caracas believe that everybody here is a malandro or something like this yes but of course here is just normal families trying to survive no they're making a life they're wrong let's buy a beer in the commercial center of pitale Venezuela okay Venezuela it's the safest place in Venezuela here wow it smells strongest milk ah wow okay and Tom says so that's really interesting that these people saying that they feel extremely safe here they can walk in the night time the shop stays open in the night time no problems that it's just a reputation that came from the past when it really was dodgy but now the economy is a little bit improved people have a bit more money and stuff and so now it's in Venezuela it's like some gang signs I'm trying to pay for my beers and my drinks and they're saying it's on the house no no in Venezuela Carpenter [Laughter] adios

at these lovely Venezuelan people blowing me kisses husband doesn't look happy husband doesn't look happy husband was giving me the Death Star anyway let's walk along here a little bit see we can't find a bit of a better Beach because that beach was terrible what's interesting about this little coastal town is you can see that in the past it was so much better just like all of Venezuela principally Caracas is the same look you can see before there were like houses here maybe that was a restaurant or a hotel and now he's just completely destroyed there was obviously a Heyday in Venezuela and unfortunately for the people that Heyday has long passed maybe he'll come back one day I don't know but right at the moment he's pretty much at the bottom of its um a bits none hey danus I don't know anyway yeah lots of these kind of things around in Venezuela yes I'd like to make a long distance for long distance phone call please never mind wow they just came up to me walked out of their way came up to me and said be really careful with your camera here because you're on a very dangerous Street really Feels Alright to me but we will always heed the advice of a knowledgeable local and then just carry on doing whatever we're doing anyway let's walk on so after what that family just said now would be a good time to discuss dangers and how I feel being in Venezuela before I came I was absolutely bricking myself I tell you a story or I'll let you into a little secret I almost didn't come when Ben bottled out I was considering bottling out myself but um I've come and I've got to be totally honest with you I feel as safe here as I felt safe in any other country that I've been to this feels no worse look the melandros are asleep you guys are asleep this feels no worse to me than um any other country I've been to that's the truth I feel the safer as I do back in England so um yeah I don't know maybe it is dangerous I'm just very naive or maybe it's not anyway carry on those are my opinions on the dangers here in Venezuela Viva Venezuela see lots of cop is about if the old Bill are about it's okay I think behind this wall wow I think behind this wall is another Beach let's go and see what it's like oh listen here is the player no no okay gracias oh here we go this looks a bit more chill guys peep in the actual sea wow we're literally 150 meters away from the other pollution field beach but this one looks like it's a little bit better let's go and check it out well this is a little bit more like it this is different from the other Beach check it out people having barbecues people in the sea this reminds me of that town we went to in um Sinaloa Mazatlan check it out normal families clean Beach pretty much oh can I find some boobies for a thumbnail anyway this is it look at it the best beach in Caracas possibly with a lovely view of a factory behind it check it out oh and here comes some tourists ah okay this is your job wow medical see Medical Services okay uh so this is basically the medical services that they have here for people on the beach if there's an emergency or someone's drowning he's basically the David Hasselhoff of Venezuela this guy doesn't look like him but still he is and this is it wow the problems okay this is the Tiburon office if you have a problem on this filthy Beach you can come here they'll save you pull some plastic out of your mouth whatever [Music] wow this is so indicative of so many well no not socialist countries many countries in fact I suppose that just they built all this infrastructure when he had a Heyday and for Venezuela that was in the 50s and the 60s when oil prices were Sky High and I suppose they built all this infrastructure and then the crisis came and then everything just left I never understood that about countries whether that being Kyrgyzstan or whether it be here in Venezuela why they let the infrastructure just just why they let the infrastructure just fall apart because it's harder to build it than to maintain it surely but what whoa there's a guy having a piss in a bush put your knob away put your knob away no problem same problems see everyone needs to piss every now and then okay wow I never expected to see a Venezuelan knob not today when I was planning my trip to Venezuela I was told that my debit card probably wouldn't work here and so I got a load of USD out the bank in small denominations tens five ones to spend here but I have been using my debit card it's worked fine which means I'm left with a load of cash probably about 400 left and there's one person here in Caracas that I'd like to give it to senor senor oh no well that's the end of the film I suppose full roll senor missed out on a few great I feel bad now senor well that's it from Caracas I would like to explore more Venezuela but unfortunately my Spanish isn't quite good enough yet to do that kind of a journey justice so I'm now going to go away for a month or two try to study a little bit more and then come back when um yeah when I'm a little bit more fluent however I do hope that this video has maybe changed some perceptions or preconceptions that you had about this country because it certainly changed some of mine um yeah it's been a mega Journey that started all the way in Cusco in the undies and has finished all the way here in Caracas so um not much more to say but adios Mis Amigos adios misamorez from Caracas [Music] [Applause]"

      "corpus": "- [Announcer] Destination North Pole. - [Reporter] The North Pole. - [Reporter] North Pole. (engine roaring) (dog barking) (bright music) - Check out this newspaper article from 1913. \"Hope To Solve Earth's Final Puzzle-Icy Crocker Island.\" And then you see this map of like the North Pole and right next to it, the theoretical location of Crocker land. A lost continent that was supposed to be right next to the North Pole. This is the early 1900s. It's a time when the world map has been thoroughly explored and documented. There were just a few places that were still kind of blank and this was one of them, the high north, an icy ocean that was incredibly difficult to get through, but people thought there was this north polar continent unexplored for now but people wanted to get in on it. They wanted to see what was up here. And in fact, a couple explorers roaming around this area had reported seeing land up here. It created this frenzy, this wonder. Was there a lost polar continent up near the North Pole? I want to show you the story of how this all went down. It's the story of the explorers who decided to go into the most impossible terrain on earth just to explore it. And it led to a passionate rivalry between these two dudes with big egos. It's full of fake photos and smear campaigns and it was kind of like the space race of the day. A race to see who could be the first to get to the top of the world. (dramatic music) Okay, so let's get up to speed on what we're talking about here. The Arctic is kind of anything above this line, but we should ditch this map. This is the Mercator projection, which I kind of have thoughts on. Where the Mercator fails is its representation of size. It massively distorts everything in the north and south and it's just not gonna be good for this story. So we need a better map. Check out this map. This one's way better. Watch. This beautiful map I have had for a very long time and I'm finally going to be able to use it for a story. Look at that beauty! (dramatic music) Man, this is just such a beautiful map, just gorgeous. This is what we're going to use to tell the story. This is the top of the world. But anyway, before we go on, I need to say thank you to today's sponsor who made today's video possible. Thank you, BetterHelp for sponsoring today's video. I've said it before and I'm gonna continue to say it. I'm a massive fan of therapy. I believe that therapy has been stigmatized over the years and we're going through an era where it's finally being normalized. I've been in therapy for a few years now. It's changed my life. And one thing I know is that finding a therapist is really hard. Like it's a often very clunky process of, like, calling doctor's offices and checking insurance and all this stuff. BetterHelp is a platform that solves this. With BetterHelp you just take a quiz and then it pairs you up with a therapist in their giant network of, like, tens of thousands of licensed therapists that aren't confined to your geographic location. And you can communicate how you want, either through text message or a phone call or a video chat. You get to choose how you communicate with your therapist. If your therapist isn't a good fit, you can change for free, which if you've ever done traditional therapy before, that's much more difficult of a process. You can message your therapist at any time and schedule live sessions when it is convenient for you. All of this allows therapy to be more accessible, more affordable, and there's even financial aid for those who need it. So there's a link in my description. It is betterhelp.com/johnnyharris. Clicking that link helps support this channel. It also gets you 10% off your first month of BetterHelp. So you can try it out at a discount and hopefully see if it's good fit for you. Thank you, BetterHelp for sponsoring this video. Let's dive into this insane story about the North Pole. Okay, the North Pole, the top of the world. Reminder that this is just one giant ocean, but the reason it looks like this is because it's frozen. You can't just, like, sail through it. And yet many explorers had this lofty goal. They wanted to reach the North Pole, the arbitrary place on our planet that's just a bunch of ice sheets sliding around where all the longitude lines come together. The place that we just decided with math was the top of the earth. You know the North Pole where Santa lives, that's what we're talking about. That is what the explorers wanted to, like, get to. So why attempt to reach an arbitrary bit of ocean that's super impractical and risky? Because it's there, dummy. We're humans. We don't ask questions like that. We just have to go. (dramatic music) People had been trying to get up here for centuries, trying to figure out what they would find. Maybe if they got through the ice, there would be some warm water ocean here. Maybe there'd be new shipping routes over the top of the globe. By 1845, explorers were making custom ships. They were reinforcing the hulls of war ships with thicker wood that could take on the pressure of the ice and they would go and explore and they didn't find any useful shipping routes. But they did find people. These people, the Inuit, knew a thing or two about how to handle the cold. They knew how to build shelters out in the ice. They made kayaks and parkas. They used dog sledges to get around. Oh, and these dog sledges are pretty cool. (dramatic music) But let's not get distracted. That's for a totally different story that I'm doing on Greenland. The point is that these American and European explorers realized that any North Pole expedition with a chance of success would need to rely on Inuit guides. So it's the late 1870s and we start to see the first serious attempts to finally reach the North Pole. Every attempt being its own version of crazy. Let me show you some of these. All of these little lines are different explorers and their attempt to get here, to the center, to the North Pole, and each one was insane. Like this guy who intentionally floated from Russia, got his boat stuck in the ice on purpose and then let the ice, which is always moving around, sort of drift him around and carry him with the hopes that it would, like, carry him to the North Pole. But instead he just did these like sort of loopy loops and eventually got, like, spit out next to Svalbard. I mean these guys were climbing, like, 30 foot ice ridges. They were facing off with polar bears whose territory this is. I mean, these guys are out exploring in some of the harshest conditions ever in the name of adventure. Exploration? Like that is why they were doing this. They became heroes for kids back home. But anyway, this is all just backstory. Our story that I really want to tell you about starts now and it has to do with this guy Robert Peary. Arctic explorer who is obsessed with getting to the North Pole. I mean just look at Robert Peary's portrait. Peary was an American Navy engineer who was dead set on becoming famous, once writing a letter to his mother saying quote, \"Remember, Mother, I must have fame.\" Like, that's who this guy is. He and his obsession with being famous is a huge part of this story. So Peary is out exploring the Arctic. He makes Greenland his hopping off point, that's sort of his home base. And on his second expedition, he breaks his leg. Luckily in his expedition he's got this Greeny doctor who comes and helps mend his leg. And while his leg was healing, they stayed up in the Arctic for, like, six months. And during that time, this Greeny Dr. Frederick Cook learns a bunch of skills for surviving in the Arctic. He even starts picking up the Inuit language. Okay, so eventually Peary's leg heals and they head back down south and Peary is like pretty impressed with the Greeny doctor who's now learned all these new skills. He's like, wow, Cook, you're incredible. We'd love to have you on our next mission here in the Arctic. But Cook wasn't into it. He didn't want to be some footnote in history. He was feeling confident after his one expedition and he decided to strike out on his own as an explorer. Peary was kinda like, okay, cool Cook, like have fun trying to be an explorer. You're like super ungrateful for everything I've taught you, like, good luck. And thus the seeds of tension were planted between these two. Old school Peary versus newbie, starry-eyed Cook, both with big egos and both willing to do what it takes to show that they were great explorers. So they go their separate ways. The newbie doctor turned aspiring explorer, Frederick Cook sets out on his own expedition back to the Arctic, feeling super confident. Wait, no, this trip doesn't get any adventure music. It was a total failure, like they barely made it to here and then they had to like turn back and abandon their ship and like, ah, Cook. And Peary is, like, loving this. While Cook was getting owned in the Arctic, Peary continues to kill it as this engineer turned Arctic explorer who pines to be famous. He's busy going to Greenland and bringing back three giant meteorites. Who goes out on an expedition and comes back with meteorites, like, from space? Peary. You're the real deal. He writes a book about his adventures and starts to get heralded as the greatest Arctic adventurer of their day. I mean, look at this face, this guy's kind of a badass. True story. I was in Greenland a few weeks ago and I tried to take a photo just like this. It didn't really work out. Okay, so back to Cook. He doesn't give up. He's slowly getting better at this whole explore the Arctic thing. He goes south to Antarctica and goes on another expedition that goes horribly wrong, but this time Cook is ready. He meets the challenge and he makes it out alive, leveling up immensely in the process. By 1898, Peary moves to Greenland, like, kind of permanently and makes his focus on getting to the North Pole. Like, that is his dream. He is training, he's recruiting people and he starts to go out on attempts. He wants to be the first person to the top of the world. And this is where we kind of start to see Peary's true colors. Like, as much of a badass as this guy is, you do a little bit of research and you realize that he's actually kind of an (beep) and like there's so much to say about this, but little sampler here, he brings back six Inuit to New York. Four of them end up dying and there's this whole insane story that you can read about in the citations. But, yeah, he's not a great guy. He cheats on his wife with a 14-year old and has a kid with her. And then there's this guy, his number two, Matt Henson. Henson was like one of the best non Inuit dog sled drivers in the world. He even learned to speak the Inuit language, something that Peary wasn't even able to do. But Peary described him as quote, \"His assistant,\" because he's black and goes on to give him basically no credit for all of his achievements. So yeah, Peary's kind of an (beep) but that doesn't mean that he wasn't also an incredibly skilled, determined explorer. I mean he stays up here for four years, refining his technique to get to the North Pole. He obsesses over gear and designs custom sledges and even creates this perfect water boiler. And he keeps going back, making attempt after attempt and each time some disaster occurs and they have to turn back. In the process, he loses eight toes to frostbite, but he keeps going. He gets closer and closer and finally decides that it is his time. So he builds this custom ship, he mounts a massive expedition and he goes out. And on what he hopes is his last expedition, he claims to have passed by a piece of land sticking out of the ice. This would later go on to fuel the idea that there's a continent up here. All these newspaper articles I was showing you about, like, is there a continent near the North Pole? But anyway, on this expedition, he still doesn't make it. The furthest he was able to get was here, just 200 miles from the North Pole, but he had to turn back. So wait, is that it? Is Peary giving up? He lost eight toes to frostbite and he didn't make it to the North Pole? Wait, just pause on Peary for a second. We'll talk about what happens next, but first we gotta get back to this guy Cook. What's Cook up to? Well it turns out the Cook continued to level up, getting more and more experience, getting more and more famous. He goes to Alaska trying to be the first to summit Denali, which is the highest peak in North America. And he comes off the mountain saying that he made it to the top. Whoa, Cook! We're no longer playing in the minor leagues. He's a legit explorer now. He's even elected as the president of the Explorers Club in New York. By 1906, he's kind of like a BFD in the explorer scene and soon he's sitting in the bougie National Geographic Society dinner in Washington DC, a dinner that was put on to actually honor Peary for all of his Arctic explorations. Okay, so this is where it gets juicy and like the tension and drama really starts to, like, rise because during this dinner Alexander Graham Bell, the guy who invented the telephone, no big deal, he gets up and is like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Peary's cool and all I know we're like celebrating him here in this dinner. But what about Cook? Let's hear from Cook. A man who's gone to the top and the bottom of the earth and the largest peak in America. So Cook gets up and toots his own horn at this dinner that was supposed to be for Peary. Peary must have been pissed at this moment. Like, this was his moment to shine. He was getting all this attention and who's there? Cook, the guy who was like a Greeny doctor who's now his rival, but who Peary considers as a hack, like not a real explorer. But now Cook is feeling good. He's no longer a newbie. So he sets his sight on beating Peary to the North Pole. The race is now on. (dramatic music) So it's 1907 and Cook heads to the Arctic. He gathers a crew to go to the North Pole. There's one other westerner, he's got nine Inuits and a dog sledge team for each. Peary was pissed at Cook at this moment for even attempting to be the first one to the North Pole. And to make things worse, Cook was using a bunch of Peary's techniques and recruiting Inuit that Peary had built relationships with and doing this all just as Peary was about to head off on a final attempt of his own. So months go by, six months and then eight months and now it's been a year and no one has heard from Cook. Is he dead? Who cares, says Peary. He's getting ready for his own expedition to the north. Teddy Roosevelt wishing him well on his way. And just like that Peary and his crew are off, racing to the North Pole. Cook? Still out there somewhere. And the world wondering who will get there first. Newspapers start wondering does he still live? It is a seesaw of doubt and hope. Who may have the story of finding the North Pole or who may be buried somewhere in the snow and ice. And headlines back then were so cool. (dramatic music) And then on September 1st, 1909, on this little island in the north, a ragged Dr. Cook appears ashore. He heads straight to the telegraph station and sends this message. (dramatic music) This is huge news. Cook says he reached the North Pole and that he found land up here in what a lot of people thought was just a frozen ocean. Okay, but wait, it's not over. Literally five days later who shows up on the Labrador coast, but freaking Peary! What? Five days later he sends his own telegram. (dramatic suspenseful music) And if the press wasn't already stoked enough about Cook having come back and discovered land and got to the North Pole first, now they're going berserk. This is so juicy, the great rivalry, climaxing in this big fight. They can't, where you can't, like, make this stuff up. So they turn to Peary and they're like, \"Oh, Cook arrived five days ago and said that he was the first one to get to the North Pole before you did.\" What? He did not just get bested by the cocky newbie that he trained. \"No, Cook is lying,\" Peary says. The rivalry between these two guys is hitting a crescendo and the newspapers, their cartoonists and their readers are all loving it. It leads to this waterfall of memes depicting the rivalry, which at this point was about ego, fame, money, reputation, all playing out in the epic Arctic, the last frontier. I mean this should be like a miniseries on Hulu. Like I would watch the hell out of this. - [Announcer] The true story of two very different men in pursuit of the same goal. - My favorite cartoon is this one. It's a \"Puck\" cover showing the North Pole holding a bag of money, with Cook holding a note saying, \"I saw you first\" and Peary holding a note saying, \"So did I.\" (laughs) Oh, it's so good. Oh. Oh, and Cook was super into like gum drops apparently. Anyway, so now it's like full blown information warfare between these two. Peary's going out on this, like, smear campaign to undermine Cook's credibility saying that he's been lying about all of his accomplishments. \"He didn't actually summit Denali,\" says Peary. So then Cook fires back revealing kind of his snarky side reminding the world that Peary is this 52-year-old man with just two toes. Oh, and it's awfully suspicious that he didn't take anyone with him who could corroborate the latitude that he was at. Among all these memes and selling of newspapers and the public bickering, the question still remained who actually got there first? Well, shouldn't that be easy? Why don't we just go to the North Pole? We can obviously go there now and see what flag is planted there. No, because remember the North Pole is just a frozen ocean and the ice drifts like miles per day. So that won't work. The only way to actually prove who got there first is to review the evidence from these expeditions, the journals and the records that these guys kept and then compare that against solid evidence. And to be honest, both these guys' accounts are full of weaknesses and weird stuff. Like remember when Peary insisted that there was a land mass up here? Well, a later expedition went out and had this like horrendous experience of trying to look for that land and they discovered that it was not there, that this was totally made up. Many think that Peary made this up in an earlier expedition to rally excitement to raise money for future trips. So what did that mean? Who actually got there first? Was everyone just lying about everything? Has the North Pole ever been discovered? Well, it would actually be decades of exploration, observation, and analysis before some clear conclusions started to emerge. For this story we read through books written by scholars who have dedicated much of their professional lives to answering this question. And here's what we can finally say with some clarity. Peary probably made it to the North Pole on this trip. Academics have debated this and most say that he came between making it like within a hundred miles to actually making it dead center to the North Pole, just depending on who you ask. And while we're at it, it's also possible that Henson, remember Henson, the number two who didn't get any credit because Peary is probably racist, was actually the first to get there because he was the guy who forged the path for Peary to follow. Meaning it was very possible that the first person to step foot on the North Pole was a black man. Kind of cool. Okay, but what about Cook? Didn't he start his journey like almost a year before Peary? Did he actually get there first? No, Cook did not get there first. Years of research has revealed that Cook was a liar, like a full-blown liar. The furthest that he probably made it was like here, 400 miles off of the North Pole. AKA, he never actually traversed the really difficult portion in all of this. He made it far enough to be able to tell a convincing story and then he headed back and sent this telegram saying that he made it there first. Whoa, Cook. Okay. But at least he's like a legit explorer, right? Like he summited Denali first. I mean he had pics. Wait, no, turns out these pics are not the top of Denali. They're actually shots from like 15,000 feet further down. AKA, not even the elevation of Denver, Colorado. Like this was a total staged photo that he lied to the world about to say that he was the first one to make it to the tallest peak in North America. Cook was a liar. He had tricked the world and many believed him. Wow, okay. So Peary was a (beep) set on being famous, but at least he was a legit explorer who probably made it to the North Pole or close to it first. And Cook, seemingly a decent explorer, was actually just a much better storyteller and a full-blown liar. (sad deflated music) But this is kind of unsatisfying because we don't actually know definitively who was the first person to, like, touch their foot on the North Pole, which is like, why do we even need to know that? Why is that important? Because it is. No one gets the credit without needing to go into all of these caveats and there's way more caveats than I've gone into here. Instead, this is a story of reputation manipulation and media blitzes, of controversy and debate, optics and lying. And instead of seeing a Neil Armstrong, we're left with more of like a couple of Elon Musk types, but I won't leave you there. Let's just say definitively who made it to the North Pole first with no asterisks. In 1926, Roald Amundsen, the man who had previously won the race to the South Pole, became the first to get to the North Pole undisputed by flying over it. So he didn't actually touch the ice, he just flew over it. But it wasn't until 1948 that a Russian was the first verified person to walk on the pole, like actually like put your boot on the North Pole. He took a plane to get there and then just like walked on the North Pole. In 1958- - [Announcer] The USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear powered submarine. - Went under the pole, which was another first, and submarines are really awesome and we made a whole video about them that you should watch. Then finally, the first undisputed person to reach the North Pole by land was a guy from Minnesota. It was essentially the culmination of like a bar bet that got way out of hand. That's a whole other story. But yeah, it was 1968 and with a snowmobile. So it really gives you an appreciation of what Peary was capable of doing decades earlier using Inuit wisdom, his own clever inventions and a lot of sled dogs. (bright music) So today the question of who got to the North Pole first is not really a question that most people are thinking about a lot when it comes to the Arctic. I went to Greenland a few weeks ago and have been reporting on the changing Arctic, exploring how different countries are vying for ownership and influence in this space because this frozen ocean won't be frozen for long and now it's opening up to new shipping routes, new resources unlocked as the ice melts. But one thing that hasn't changed is how the media treats a story like this. A race, a rivalry of public gossip fest with big egos, hungry for attention and especially when there's imagery to go along with it. I think we're all eager to believe what we see when it fulfills some deep need to witness the excitement of exploration. And today, the people who still want to be in the spotlight do so by bickering and boasting about how great they are. And the media still gleefully covers it all. Covering the lies, covering the deceptions, as long as there's a great story and a great image to go along with it. And sometimes that's fact checked and the truth comes out and sometimes we just never know. (dramatic music) Wasn't this a nuts story? Like, isn't it just wild, these two characters and how it's like not that much different from people on Twitter today? Anyway, this was another deep dive where we had so much stuff and if you look at the info doc, which is like our kind of research doc for this, it's literally hundreds of pages long. So anyway, thanks for watching. I hope this was a fun one for you. And, yes, this map is permanently just up in my studio because I want to look at it every day of my life. Speaking of maps, let me show you something. I made a poster about maps and I'm very, very excited about it. It is called All Maps are Wrong, and it is a display of a bunch of map projections, basically the mathematical algorithms that we use to take a spherical thing called the Earth and put it onto a flat thing called a piece of paper. This map kind of celebrates that. It has a little explainer in the middle that explains why we need to do this. And then it has a name of all of the map projections that are displayed on this poster. This is beautiful and cool and fun and I've been wanting to design something like this for years, but it's also a way that you can help support what we're doing here. We're trying to make rigorous journalism on YouTube, not as a part of like a big corporate entity, but just like us. And to do that we more and more rely on our community to help us do it better and to be able to pour ourselves into these stories. And we kind of have a big team that helps us do this now, like our team is growing. In fact, speaking of our team, we publish an extra video every month that introduces you to the behind the scenes of what we do here. It is an intro to our team, to all of the people and the processes and the shenanigans of running this studio. That is available to people who are members of The Newsroom, which is just what we call our Patreon. The Newsroom is a place that supports us, but also gets you this extra video every month. It gets you access to scripts, you get royalty free music that you can use, and it's just a fun community. I like post things there like, like I ask for help on thumbnails and titles. I get feedback every once in a while. Do a Q&A with the community. So that is patreon.com/johnnyharris. We have lots and presets that we use to color our videos and photos. We're publishing more courses over at Bright Trip, which is the travel startup that we started a few years ago and is growing. I think that's it. So thank you all for being here. Thanks for watching this video. We've got a lot more coming and I'll see you in the next one. Bye. What? - [Director] And go get your poster. - And go get your poster. And go get your poster. Should I reference Greenland? I should. I'd be like, I just was up here. Like, I can't not be like by the way, like. - [Director] No, it's not relevant. - Really. - [Director] You can say that at the end of a video. We have all this footage. Can I not be, like, keep me honest with Peary. (slurping)"

      "corpus": "[Music] 10 years ago I went to Brunei and I hated it I was kicked out of this mosque and yelled at for no reason despite being respectful I became terrified to hear about their strict Islamic laws which involved stoning gay people to death and on top of all of that I found the country to be extremely boring with literally nothing to do except eat I shared all of my thoughts in a video which was viewed by more than 15 million people on the internet but at that time I was young and naive as a 22 year old Backpacker so I decided to go back to give Brunei a second chance with an open mind and a willingness to uncover the true story but I have to admit I am pretty nervous my face is all over the Internet saying bad things about Brunei and surely everyone in the country including the sultan himself has seen the video what if I am blacklisted what if the immigration officer captures me and takes me to jail there's only one way to find out and I'm on my way [Music] there's no chance they would take me to prison right if I was blacklisted my name would be on a system for sure yeah I'm unlisting all my brunette content right now because I'm worried that I'm going to be caught and seeing just gotta play safe 2013 was the last time I went to Brunei must be different this is actually a new Airline for me last time I flew AirAsia so Royal Brunei Airways new always touch the plane for good luck [Music] that sound is the Quran the holy book of Islam which makes me feel like I'm on a plane to Saudi Arabia or Yemen here goes nothing it's a weird feeling to be here in like the population of this country is like less than a million the videos that I made here have gotten over like 25 million views let's just get through immigration with them you feel better I was greeted at the airport by a local friend named Bryant who I met just a week before on Instagram how are you doing that's a bad dude I was worried about the immigration with like dude is that right yeah Brunei is a tiny country in Southeast Asia on Borneo Island in between Malaysia and Indonesia the population is only 450 000 and culturally it feels like Singapore with a mix of ethnic malays Chinese Indonesians Indians and Filipinos and everyone speaks English welcome to Brunei both Singapore and Brunei are small and clean and the two currencies are pegged to each other which means they always have the exact same value however unlike Singapore Brunei is very laid back without many things to do and it's also a lot cheaper as you drive around the country you'll see an assortment of really cool looking mosques and buildings and a lot of flags on the streets a lot of this has to do with the government there is a sultan or a king and he can be seen on every single building and household in the country so every establishment is by law is required to have the two pictures of the sultan and his wife by law can't open up a place without it let's just say that the Sultana Brunei is a very interesting man in recent years he implemented Sharia law which is a strict Islamic code of conduct that bans liquor and forces Muslims to live a certain way under constant surveillance thanks to a booming oil industry the sultan is known to be one of the top 10 richest men on Earth with an estimated wealth of 30 billion dollars therefore all bruneians get benefits like free health care no income tax and free education I think to the outside world is very fascinating thing because here you know his word is law but I think with Brunei the sultan he is very very generous and he's very kind and like whenever I talk to people about Bruno oh yeah my country has no taxes free education free healthcare they were like oh can we move there if no taxes and free health care sound like a sweet deal just wait until you see these gas prices we are rolling up to a gas station now and because Brunei is such an oil rich country gas is subsidized and it's super cheap and as Karen said it's cheaper than water one liter of petrol cheaper than one liter water one liter water is a dollar yeah hi hello how are you you're going to be surprised when you see the prices it costs just 13 bucks to fill up his entire car in my country this would be like 120 dollars after fueling up for the day Brian took me to get some breakfast at the most local Brunei and Joint that's been around since World War II it is a pretty festive scene in here of a lot of people eating breakfast I've been to a lot of restaurants in my life and I've never seen a menu that looks like this every single item is made from bread sugar and eggs after all we are in Southeast Asia and that means you can find something different on every menu whoa yeah it's really sweet really good though it's like peanutty like a custard this is one of the stranger breakfast experiences I've ever had but I mean everyone's here and loving it like it's busy here it is hi I hope you enjoy a good night this time very much yeah because I love video you're not really keen on good night what did you think about my last video uh to pick some of the fake stuff right yeah I know then uh there's something wrong with your visit to the mall yeah because normally stop service going to the bus I'm gonna head back there and check it out yeah so far Brunei is a lot better than I remembered it being and I hope that continues throughout the trip I was trying to say like last time at Candy Brunei I did not see this cool hipster graffiti on the walls yeah yeah I don't know if Brunei has changed or if I just didn't come to the right places I think you just thinks dude I used to love The Simpsons growing up hey you're that guy yeah I'm that guy you're that guy how are you I'm good man you live here uh yeah I live here what's it like to live here it's fun it's such a great place I mean very peaceful I already love it way better like and I didn't really know what's going on yeah I think I saw your video like when it first came out do you think all the people here were pissed I think a lot of people here requests I mean there was some truth to it yeah yeah I mean I understand it's so crazy to be here man like I'm getting flashbacks from my last trip here but it's just different and obviously being with Bryant like he's taking me to the cool spots and that just shows you like having a local friend is

back to Brunei as Bryant was driving me around bandar sari begawan yes that is actually the name of the capital city I found out something really interesting about him you're in a band yeah dude it's a pop punk band music similar to like Simple Plan uh link most importantly show me one of your songs [Applause] I feel like I'm in high school again Middle School it's pretty cool man thanks man punk rock aside I am really eager to see the everyday life of regular people in Brunei away from all the restaurants mosques and plazas this brings me to a really unique settlement along the river which I wasn't able to visit on my last trip to Brunei right now we are cruising around kampong aie which is the water Village here of Brunei you can see the houses are literally made on sticks in the water so like on this side a couple mayor people usually Drive their cars they pop and then they can walk into caboir but this side mostly is taking boat we've got some fishermen here you guys catch any fish can I see it awesome have a good day guys thank you crazy to be out here in like see this community there's 11 000 people living out here in this Village it's just surreal as I understand that is the current Palace of the king yep the king stays there right now how big is it oh it's huge man I think there's about 1 788 rooms in there 1 700 radio rooms so how big is his family and people here like are they friendly with him like does he go walk around on the streets um this time to time when he does like uh surprise visits and like people just love it man everybody loves the salsa here that's good to hear it's always a good thing when the people like the leader of their country yeah because most of the time it's the opposite exactly yeah that is true how many planes does he have three planes two helicopters three planes three helicopters all right it's a good life sold that many money [Music] this bridge definitely wasn't here last time I was in Brunei pretty cool so we made it on land kind of on land we're still over the water it's cool like it's pedestrian only up here there's no motorbikes there's no bicycles there's no cars it's just like a sidewalk yeah and you walk around and so the guy was telling you that the bathroom like it's just a hole in the ground yeah everything goes straight into the water because there's no Plumbing uh for this for the new houses yeah they do but the old ones you know there's this really beautiful mosque right in front of me check this out Little Blue Dome mosque I must say that brunette is pretty patriotic because everywhere you go in this country you see Flags waiting the local life up here is pretty cool you can see just here's the front house of someone doing the laundry outside got a garden what do you think of this place it's nice dude it's just very hot it's peaceful though it is not a lot of noise you know no road noise yeah we're near the equator down here in Borneo Island man it's no joke I mean everything is basically rainforest when you get outside the city after wandering around the village aimlessly for 20 minutes Bryant took me to his friend's house to try some local bruneian food how are you nice to meet you for my home state yeah this is beautiful my son what is it like to live here yeah yes we love to live in kamoha I am it's very nice in here yeah few of the residents are have moved on to land as well so most of the houses are left abandoned here yeah so we are the one of the ones come back and just make it alive again and share it to people to come and experience the componential how people live in caboir so ambuyen is a very traditional uh dish here in Brunei mainly known as our national dish we're actually going to show you how we're gonna make it so it's the from the bark of the Sago tree which is turned into powder rice sounds cool remember a few months ago when I ate Sago on Papua Island well this is the same dish just prepared a little differently yeah and we're gonna soften a little bit with a little bit of water it looks like cotton candy well some people more like it's not Mochi yeah it's not really my second guess yeah Abu where do we start so we are gonna poke it a little bit and then you you pull it up and then you twist it with that poke it yeah and you hold it like yes correct and then you you pull it up and then you twist it yeah I'm kind of nervous to eat this right now Cheers Cheers Cheers it tastes good because of the sauce yeah without it it's just tasteless it's the weirdest texture [Music] epic failure it's too far away just pull the ball near to you you guys only with your hands like traditionally yeah we have this traditional portable sink here where you wash rinse off your hands she just she put it in her mouth and it swallowed into it exactly so it probably fills you up because it sticks yes yes so the ambuya is actually it digests and turns into water in your stomach okay so it is normal to feel a little bit bloated because you're done loaded good word choice yeah okay so a whole conversation went out within the community here in Brunei the fact that you got kicked out of the Moss yeah I really I really did by the way yeah I didn't have footage of it because um I went in 2013 and then I wasn't filming back then what after that video went out what happened here I mean there was a whole conversation about what happened and I mean I heard from the tourist guide communities because I'm quite close to them and they were talking about it and I feel like I mean I don't know have you been there back there since my first time back in Brunei okay I came here to give Brunei a second chance yeah which as you can see is a lot better than the first time yeah the hospitality that I've received so far in Brunei is incredible and not what I expected that just goes to show the value in giving a place a second chance with a fresh mind and New Perspectives the call to prayer has just come on so cool it's weird to be in Brunei like so far away from the Middle East and experience the culture here also Malaysia and Indonesia are predominantly Muslim the whole Borneo island is Muslim but I don't know Brunei it's just a different different world out here I must say that this water Village has been fantastic but I'm nervous to head back to the mainland and into that mosque behind me is the famous soas mosque and this is the one that I entered 10 years ago and I got kicked out after respecting everything I took off my shoes I had pants below my knees it wasn't prayer time and I walked in and the guy was like get out you can't be here so I'm gonna give another chance have you ever been inside no personally I haven't first time for you first time you're gonna try with me yeah all right I'm sure it's gonna go great but we're gonna enter the Omar I'm not gonna try to pronounce it Sultan Omar let's go I may look calm on camera but internally I am shaking if there's any chance of getting arrested and thrown in the hands of the government it'll happen right now while I'm re-entering in this mosque [Music] thank you foreign how do you feel in here nice it's very nice I really like it man this is your country man it's cool that you get to finally like see inside which is fine crazy moment like I have very Vivid memories of being in here I'm getting yelled at so it was through the other door I think there's a door right there and then I was like he was like get out of here what a moment to be here right now I'm trying to separate my previous experience at the mosque with the present moment but as any traveler who revisits a site knows it's difficult to get rid of those preconceptions all I can say is that I am just stunned by this architecture and the spirit of reverence [Music] come back okay okay thank you thank you oh nice to meet you I'm a local here oh really yeah so last time I came here I had a bad experience oh yeah yeah but I just had a great experience oh yeah thank you so much that's why I came back they just kicked me out for no reason yeah yeah but uh it's a pretty special place yeah do you guys like living here yeah yeah yeah it's very peaceful yeah it's a nice place and you know yeah low crime as well yeah yeah very beautiful as well I like your T-shirt you're all the same yeah yeah so I'm Jewish you're Muslim it doesn't matter yeah it's all the same bro yeah goodbye I must say that this mosque is epic I mean even at night time everything lights up but just walking around this place I just met like the coolest people that came up to me and I don't know everyone's super friendly here that's why you always got to give a place a second chance because when you go the first time there's so many variables that can make her make a trip like the weather or how you're feeling or how you're treated or who you're hanging out with but you got to come back a second time and things are different you know I'm much older and wiser and we're more respectful and more educated and so this time this is so much better than last gotta go back see it with a different lens in the main walking street by the mosque there's all these food vendors and they open up at night and there's one place here selling durian Kendall Kendall is like this dessert so uh we're gonna try it out see how it is I bet it's good for those who don't know durian is a tropical spiky fruit native to Borneo Island and it's famous for its pungent smell and custard-like taste sweet put it this way durian is banned on the Metro in Singapore and when you eat it you burp up The Taste the next day but I must say after trying it over 20 times I've come to like it we don't have durian in America I'm not sure what to think right now I could smell that smells like durian where which one is the durian upstairs so I'm not in the bottom oh no you mix it up first you know you're drinking pure like syrup okay I'm a mess right now dude I don't know how I don't know how to approach this I don't know how to eat this it's actually pretty good yeah it's good yeah some cream on your mustache appreciate that that is real sweet mix it up dude this is like a heart attack in a cup just to show how friendly the people are this vendor would not accept my money because I am a tourist and she wanted to make sure that I walked away with a positive impression of Brunei that is amazing I'm a boss thank you she's so nice she didn't even want the tip well it looks like I'm having fun and I certainly am if you compare it to 10 years ago I must admit that Brunei is very odd as you've learned from the Sultan of Brunei there is a lot of wealth floating around this country and you can see it in the form of ridiculous buildings and I mean ridiculous there is this so-called eight-star Hotel and golf course called the Empire hotel which overlooks the South China Sea in the middle of nowhere it costs more than 1.5 billion US dollars to build back in the year 2000 and I'm here to see it with my own two eyes welcome to Brunei God I feel like I'm in Dubai or something the street level that we just walked in is the fifth floor actually it goes down look all the way down there's a big pool right here and that's the sea I'm really enjoying my time here this country is really cool and special and unique but I do get slight Turkmenistan Vibes here gosh this city is completely over the top and bizarre just because you have these like crazy buildings and cool things around you beautiful mosques but the streets are pretty dead I mean really dead it's weird that like you would expect there to be a lot of people around and you don't see much of it but nonetheless it's cool it's different it's Unique yeah man I mean it's like the most luxury as you can get here in Brunei like people from all over the world they come here and they stay here and they just have a like a good time what do you think it costs a night 300 500 maybe maybe a small room for like a standard room [Music] we're on negative one floor I'm so confused right now I don't know what I don't know what's going on there's so much space in here you can fit the whole country of Brunei in this one building [Music] if I took a golf ball and I teed it up right here I could take a full swing with a pitching mode and it would land inside of the building that's how big it is saying bro feels like a big mall with no stores in it I've never seen Windows this big before in my life apparently this hotel has hosted multiple presidents it's just like the place to be if you're a tourist and you want luxury there's definitely no second option of where to stay this is the place it's hard to comprehend this multi-billion Dollar Hotel in the middle of nowhere I wonder how that money could be used to benefit the local population instead of just showing off on that same note life in Brunei is so strict with bizarre laws like the complete ban of cigarettes alcohol and bars there is an eerie Vibe on the streets because everything is dead even the street signs are strange because they're all in Arabic and few people here speak Arabic not to mention that we are 6 000 miles away from the Middle East right in front of us there's a Jollibee sign but it's in Arabic why because all science here need to have Arabic in it Arabic has to be the biggest as you can see like all the different signs here Arabic biggest Malay second and then English is smaller we learned it in school to write to write it yeah yeah mommy yeah last time I was in Brunei I remember vividly it was a Friday night I could hear a pin drop on the street because there's nothing to do all the restaurants were closed all the people went home by like nine o'clock so I want to challenge ourselves to like have fun I don't know what that means it means throw a house party go to McDonald's order a bunch of food like what do you what do you think we can do you know what maybe we should go to border dude which border the Malaysian border the Malaysian border how far away is it 45 minutes half an hour depends how fast you drive and what's what's happening there you'll find out I imagine on the other side they sell booths yeah for people that want to drink yep so we can just roll up and cross the border immigration no problem no problem we have to do it voter time let's go man everywhere you drive in this country is just like another stunning mosque we're approaching the Palace of the sultan and there's like 2 000 rooms for just the workers on the side of the house this is just the entrance right here yep holy crap whoa insanely big after about 30 minutes we've arrived we're approaching the Malaysian border and I've never been to Malaysian Borneo before all right for your time first time first time man they don't they don't care going into Malaysia the last border I was at was the Indonesia Papua New Guinea border and I got the United entrance in the Papua New Guinea I'm standing in no man's land but I'm not allowed to cross over unfortunately sad times got it yeah dude we're in sweet oh dude welcome to Mexico oh the count is here dude literally it's literally like 20 meters away from the book checkpoint I understand why people not even come here it makes perfect sense to me right behind me is the actual border and these guys can hear the music of the bars in front of me so epic man let's get some drinks bars on both sides lots and lots of people everywhere they're from Malaysia but they're sticking Mandarin we just left Brunei let's go thank you it is insane the contrast here it is like a full-on party does this work Yep this is squid squid this is chicken oh yeah it's a party in Malaysia man this is the best food I've ever had it's basically like a hawker Center yeah everywhere around here they're selling different foods it is so hot here and there's a bucket of ice water so you know what I'm about to do oh my god oh that feels good you're very busy yeah around like 45 US Dollars yep for all of that Ivy is so cheap here you need to pay money thank you bye-bye you like it yeah it's a bit like you know right outside the country there's this whole setup I think when my friends visited they were like wow what is a different world what a different one like right outside the immigration yeah how are you finding the experience incredible yeah very shocked first time good on Alberta this is way better okay we just ate our food it was delicious now we just crossed the street like a 10 second walk and we enter the nightclub let's go [Music] [Music] how are we near Brunei right now what started out as my most stressful trip of the year ended in a wild party and local Shenanigans this goes to show that giving any destination a second chance is always worthwhile my first trip to Brunei was bad and it's been bothering me for the last decade but back then I was young and naive I didn't know where to go or who to hang out with and maybe I'll admit that I was a little close-minded but travel changes you this trip taught me that Brunei is a land full of contrast from strict rules to laid-back mindsets from luxury Lifestyles to Humble societies I am so grateful that I was able to experience that water Village for real this time as well as step inside that lovely Moss that I was kicked out of 10 years ago the friendliness and Hospitality of Brunei is something that will leave a lasting impression until I come back and this party across the border is really something unique so thank you guys for watching this video my voice is completely dead right creep [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]"

      "corpus": "we are two days into this thing called the monkey run 40 people from around the world were crazy enough to attempt to drive a thousand kilometers across Peru on these little things called Monkey Bikes hence the monkey onesies this adventure is completely unsupported and there's no set route I think about the worst possible thing just happened which is a pretty good recipe for an adventure my clutch literally snapped in half especially since these motorcycles are reliably unreliable oh the starting line was in the town of ayakucho high in the Andes mountains and we have eight days to get all the way to the Finish Line deep in the Amazon jungle oh I could possibly go wrong so far we've only made it to here and still have to get here wondering how we're gonna finish before the cutoff so are we in case you missed part one of this series let me catch you up you almost got first of all we have to learn how to drive a manual motorcycle because neither of us had done that before minor wrecks that's been going well we were off to a decent start the views were beautiful we met lots of friendly locals but unfortunately day two is when things started going downhill I think this is the fastest I've ever gotten sick of my life and neither of our motorcycles would start well to start to the morning he's pulled the entire carburetor off of cares bike that night we found ourselves in the middle of nowhere desperate for a place to sleep it's possible but thankfully this local family took us in and we got to have a sleepover with several guinea pigs beneath our bed after our 6 a.m wake-up call to Madre literally chopping wood right next to our bed we unfortunately realized our cold sleep did not help Nate's illness so after finally getting my motorcycle to start again we said goodbye to our family and plan to have a nice easy drive to the next big town so that we could get Nate some medicine and a nice bed to rest and recover in spoiler alert that is not what happened at all I think about the worst possible thing just happened [Music] holy cow we just drove 30 kilometers through a cloud on wet Gravelly roads I am completely Frozen do you see how white my fingers are oh you're never gonna get better I'm currently wearing every single piece of clothing that I brought I thought we were gonna throw away these monkey onesies after day one I'm so glad we kept them it was supposed to be like a joke I don't know we would have done without it honestly it looks beautiful we were pretty on edge and put our cameras away because we realized we were potentially driving through cartel country [Music] thankfully we made it down the mountain drama-free but we weren't celebrating yet here's where things started to go south we had to get across this River and there was only one way to get to the other side good time we hadn't seen anyone else on this bridge and had no idea if it was safe after he made it across I had no choice but to follow nice not only is that the sketches Bridge I've ever watched across but I walked across it with a motorcycle even though we had just spent all morning descending it was already time to climb up and over Another Mountain but little did we know this was the beginning of the worst Road of the entire trip let me tell you what these monkey bikes are not made for gravel roads with baseball-sized gravel every time your front wheel hits one it just shoots the bike in a different direction we're literally having to walk the bikes up the hill so one of the most tiring things I've ever done I think about the worst possible thing just happened we've been on this road for two hours we haven't seen any other cars we decided to stop and have a water break put my kickstand down walked away my bike fell over and look at this clutch literally snapped in half this means I can't change gears can't turn the bike on the bike is useless without this we haven't seen any cars this is by far the worst maintained road that we've been on we're literally stuck in the middle of nowhere the only thing I can think is URI take my bike up and try to find somebody with a truck or we try to start it without the clutch somehow just go in first the whole way up and then figure it out up there and I don't know what's up there but it's got to be more than down here yeah well so much for making it to the big town with the pharmacy I was literally just thinking if one of us popped a tire on one of these sharp rocks we would be in so much trouble and something even worse happened I cannot believe this so here's what we're thinking since it's stuck in first there's a chance that I can start it oh I can still oh this is good [Applause] hold it down hold on I'm gonna pop and see what happens wish me luck all right see you later my goodness I can't believe that worked like this oh okay you guys I better get going okay rarely does the situation get so intense and challenging that we don't pick up the camera but that's what happened here just trust us when we say that this afternoon was the most challenging of the entire trip real quick Nate from the future here as you can tell this is a bit of a spoiler work that we did indeed survive the monkey run but just because you're watching this and I'm sitting in a nice hotel doesn't mean that we actually finished so we have to keep watching but for

description below okay that's all the energy I have back to the bike ride oh my gosh that was the most exhausting drive but we've made it to civilization we were literally pushing our bikes up this mud hill into the first town that we've seen in Forever look how much mud is caked on my tires and my bike literally shut down right in front of a mechanic shop like what are the chances and the next thing we knew he took off Nate's clutch so hopefully he's about to fix that too so away first stop to ask if he could help fix the clutch and he said no that I think he could see how desperate we were so now he's pulled the clutch off of this bigger motorcycle use an angle grinder to cut it down to size drilled holes in it and he's got to try to fit it on this tiny bike good no way well he starts not the best place to check your clutch oh yes I will love it it depends on his ear and everything my eyes are tearing up just the fact that this worked out we could have still been on the side of the mountain with no one I love these people I can't get in my pocket which is gracias he was only going to charge me five dollars for that anyway I try to give him more money he refused crazy [Music] fancy [Music] wow oh my gosh I never thought we would get here look at my leg I'm so wet we are so dirty I haven't even brushed my teeth today oh today was just fall on from the moment I was conscious this morning like literally I woke up to Madre chopping wood and it has just been non-stop I don't think I've ever been so tired of my whole life um day four feels like it's been a lifetime so yesterday I was probably feeling a two out of ten today I have a little bit more of my voice back and I'm feeling maybe five out of ten still a bit feverish but way better than yesterday but up at dilla's point it has been all that we could do to make it from point A to point B and that's included driving in the dark every single night and we have made it 340 kilometers in total in three days we have three and a half days left until the Finish Line party which is the cut off for finishing the monkey run and we have 664 kilometers left so basically we have to do twice as much mileage every day just to make it to the finish line which may sound impossible but I think we have about two hours left on dirt roads today and then we connect to a highway the plan was to avoid the highway because that's where all the dangerous traffic is but at this point we have no other option if we want to finish so that's the plan [Applause] it is sunny it is warm and we're gonna drive so far today the next two hours are potentially our last two hours on back roads this whole trip and I know as soon as we hit the highway I'm gonna miss these back roads in a weird way so yeah today is all about embracing the camera waving at all the locals and the cows look at that monkey go this road is so fun it's like I'm playing Mario Kart I'm going max speed and avoiding the potholes and these mountains are gorgeous this road is a little bumpy but 100 better right now we're never gonna make it because we keep stopping and taking photos look at these switchbacks no this is amazing this turn on day one would have freaked me the heck out not today baby oh not that we needed any more drama but I just crashed the Drone into the side of the mountain and I had to climb down and get it and it might as well have been Mount Everest climbing back up here with the way I feel oh my gosh I'm a tiny bit embarrassed to admit this but we learned this morning day four the proper way to start these bikes I was having trouble starting it as usual and our host at the hotel came over to Nate and showed him how to just barely turn the I don't even know the proper words well we got the Drone back it only took me about 30 minutes to find it so so there's like the start button and then you kind of pull the handle back to get it started I've just been going all the way back like full sin to start it and it's just like he just pulled it back just the slightest like not even half an inch started no problem I think I've been the problem better late than never I guess thank you [Music] a little traffic jam this morning oh shoot you think it had the hang of that by now I can't believe it three people I want a motorcycle chocolate gracias oh life is good we have ice cream we're on paved roads I'm feeling optimistic right now that we're gonna make it this morning I was convinced we were trying to do the impossible we kind of embraced the last two hours a little too much because it ended up taking us three so instead of stopping for a proper lunch we're having ice cream and Doritos all right so we're currently in the town of euripa and we've decided let's not even set a goal for tonight we're just gonna drive as far as we can and if we don't set a goal we can't fail if you look at a map right now at how like I could have walked to where we are ready also both of our ice creams together seven soles all right back on the bike look at that City foreign [Music] I'm honestly not sure how it gets better the kilometers are ticking away we're on top of the Andes there's a herd of alpaca behind us it's sunny oh today is so good [Music] [Music] thank you we're not in the mountains anymore I'm in a little bit of like culture shock right now [Music] okay so mileage wise today has been our biggest day yet and it is only 4 32 which means we still have two hours of daylight we've made it to andelias and we have stopped for a coffee now we have a very important decision to make the question is did we stop here find a hotel before it gets dark or do we press on through what looks like an incoming rainstorm and most likely end up driving in the dark just like we have every night the problem is according to Google Maps there are no hotels for 150 kilometers so once we start there's no turning back and there's a chance we'll be driving until midnight but we know if we stop now and that's just that much more mileage that we have to do the last two and a half days well I hate to complain but this is the smallest number all right so we're taking a risk we've decided to stay put for the night honestly I just started feeling terrible again I've got the sweats and I yeah I did not want to be stuck in the rain in the dark between two towns but that means that we have to do almost 300 kilometers of driving tomorrow it sounds impossible and it probably is but the plan is to get up at 6 a.m and be heading out I don't know we're close to not finishing at this point to be fair we haven't left earlier than 9 30 this whole time and tomorrow will be our first day doing all highway driving so it is possible I'm just not in a good place right now yeah you need to go to bed wow I just had my first hot shower of the whole trip and we just had the most delicious quinoa for dinner I'm feeling so refreshed Nate and I did end up getting two separate rooms I just wanted to have the best night's sleep possible but since I'm alone I just wanted to take this opportunity just to say how much I admire Nate like I don't say it enough but he constantly blows me away with his determination his good attitude his strength I am perfectly healthy right now and I literally almost didn't make it yesterday I cannot fathom what it must be like to do what we're doing right now while being sick and he has not complained a single time I'm just so proud of him I love him so much I hope he gets better also I think we've hit a new low we got coffees to go and in the morning I'm gonna have room temperature coffee from the night before that's where we are right now [Music] [Music] all right we got some good sleep last night we have 12 hours until the sun sets let's see if we can do 300 kilometers [Music] come on I know how to solve this problem [Music] foreign [Applause] getting up at 5am was so worth it this early morning drive was beautiful the Sun was shining there was hardly any traffic and we made amazing time 300 kilometers all the way to Cusco just kidding this is the monkey run nothing went as planned let me tell you what really happened about 30 minutes into the drive this morning it got to the point where I could have run faster than my bike was moving so we pulled over to check it out we tightened some things we loosened some things we tweaked the chain we cleaned the filter probably the most manly thing I've ever done but somehow I think we just made it worse we've been feeling really behind schedule and worried about making it to the Finish Line in time plus with Nate still being sick I was so hopeful we'd get to Cusco today this sucks I'm just mad it's already eight o'clock this is supposed to be our big day we're 30 minutes outside of town it's looking like we're gonna have to go back let's go back I was emotional for lots of reasons but I really just felt like it was my fault we weren't gonna make it next we went on a hunt for oil thinking maybe that would help because mine was low tennis is that oil hopefully that fixes it but it didn't after what felt like an eternity we finally made it 150 kilometers to the next big town where we could see a mechanic thankfully a nice man met us on the street and literally used his bare hands to adjust some things on my bike 30 seconds later he claimed my motorcycle was fixed well that's not good it's supposed to look like that finally snapped wow if you missed the first episode I spent the majority of training day building those baskets on the back of our bikes and I was pretty proud that they had held up this long but I finally broke off in traffic and by some miracle my backpack did not fall out in they can't survive City paved roads the mistake we made today was setting expectations that we were going to do a lot of driving it's almost comical at this point honestly like what else could I'm not even gonna say it but we did find a really nice guy who is now cut all my hack job off and now he's actually going to solder a piece of metal onto the rack to hold the basket so surely that will get my backpack to the end of this journey if I had to go out on a limb I'm going to say we're not going to make 300 kilometers today I really respect this guy he's not cutting any Corners he's been working on this for a very long time and it looks really nice I want to get mine done but one I feel kind of bad because this is probably not what he enjoys doing and also we got to get on the road we're just gonna hope mine stays look at this beauty I'm not sure how the people with the monkey run are gonna fill it out they permanently of fixing a ratchet the back of their bike it's on there now we had 300 deposits on both of these I think when we pull up to the Finish Line we're just gonna say keep it just don't even look at it just we asked how much and he said NADA wasn't gonna charge us we've been here for an hour he's worked on both of our bikes of course we've gave him money but the fact that he said no I love this place foreign hours of sunlight left and we're just gonna make it as far as we can with no expectations I'm not even gonna look for a hotel room Google Maps we're just gonna drive until it gets dark [Music] that mechanic was really good at building a rack but not so good at fixing bikes Cara's bike fighting me going slower than it was this morning I literally think I could run I'll kill faster than it's going it's ridiculous [Music] Morgan's dark foreign [Music] okay so a lot has transpired in the last 15 minutes this was the last town we were passing through before the sunset so we decided to stop and see one more mechanic to see if anybody could get us idea of why Karen's bike is moving 10 miles an hour we're going uphill we don't know the exact translation but from what I understood there's a smaller chain inside of the bike that may be broken and the closest place to get one of those is Cusco which is still two and a half hours away on Kara's bike it's probably eight hours away so long story short this guy is about to attempt to put our motorcycles on top of his Minivan and take us to Cusco what an adventure uh muy Fuerte um this motorbike is tiny but it probably weighs at least 300 pounds I have no clue how we're gonna get this onto the roof and neither do they okay so it started at 150 pesos which was ridiculously cheap to be fair it went up to 200 now it's gone up to 300. a quick math off the top of my head I think that's 75 for a three hour taxi ride that sounds pretty good all right looks a lot smaller when it's not inside a minivans good day Gasolina see you we have one bike in it's taking us I think he said it's leaking gas which is what happens when you turn these bikes sideways maybe he's unfamiliar with monkey bikes he knows how like real functioning motorcycles work and maybe they aren't supposed to leak gas when you lay them sideways but that's been the case 100 of the time with these fights I thought I was optimistic because these guys think they're gonna fit two motorcycles can you cut it's up to you I do really appreciate this guy's help he was very enthusiastic to take us to cousins every time the bite doesn't fit like he wants it to then he gets mad at me I mean it is our fault he was the one that wanted to take us in the minivan we thought he had a plan is what we're saying he said yes so quickly it was like he did this all the time oh my yes I want to see even the locals are filming which is when you know it's good so that's the seat cushion that just came out they've honestly got it further than I expected whatever [Laughter] three hours all right home sweet home for the next three hours [Music] okay I can guarantee that Jeff Gordon is going to get us there in less than three hours I'm not sure if my life was safer on that bike in the dark or in this van [Music] so it really smells like gas and I may just die from a Haywood infused before we get there why would you do that I was already freaking out because they just stopped here and got out I don't know where he went wow made it to Cusco I think I might be high from inhaling gas fumes that could also just be from being on a bike for 12 hours or who knows I'm so happy we're here oh okay so I am officially a crazy person this morning I woke up at 6am and I was like here we gotta go we gotta get the bikes fixed we have a day and a half to make it 220 kilometers okay I was like I thought to finish that was on Sunday I was like what's today Friday somehow we have an extra day that I never accounted for so things are a little less stressful but we still have all the same problems that we had yesterday actually somehow we have more problem number one my new beautiful rack lasted about three hours they broke both of the baskets off our bikes in order to get them in the cars yesterday so we've got to figure out how to put our baskets back on I'm really hoping this isn't gonna break off okay okay I don't know it might actually just work all right we might be off to a really strong start okay so it's a little more wonky than it was yesterday but I think it's gonna hold Kara's is another story this one I do not expect to be so easy what is going on back here I only have two more of these white zip ties so if I mess one of these up we're in trouble ready for this I'll knock the bike over I honestly think that's better than it was before problem number two will our bike start and we laid on their side yesterday during transport we learned from care crashed the bike a couple times that the bikes really don't like to start after they've been laid on their side so we're in the middle of nowhere what are we supposed to do also there's a great chance that there's no gasoline left because I think it all leaked out during the drive both of our eyes were so bloodshot when we got to the hotel last night it was crazy yeah I'm not sure what was more dangerous inhaling gasoline for three hours or trying to drive that road at night what first try what today is our day I really don't want to push this to the mechanic uphill it's even idling today's our day so now we head to the mechanic to hopefully get Care's bike in Tip Top shade for the last 220 kilometers while we were out looking for mechanics 2 Angels on the side of the road had a look at my engine tweaked a few things and told me it should be working perfectly fine now we were very tired so we decided to trust them and we went back to try to get some much needed rest I think my body knew that it didn't have to survive yesterday so all the sickness it's it's been holding and it just let out I was in bed for 16 hours yesterday which might be the longest that I've ever slept but I did start some antibiotics yesterday on the recommendation of my brother-in-law who is a doctor so hopefully those kick in soon definitely feeling a little better this morning and uh telling my body it's time to go back into survival mode oh also this is by far the nicest hotel we've booked on this trip you could tell cusco's a much more touristy area because this hotel costs 10 times more than what we have been paying for hotels but it was still less than a hundred dollars [Music] all right goodbye Cusco we officially have a day and a half to get to the Finish Line it is 220 kilometers away and after we leave the city we are heading into the jungle which is going to be a whole new challenge first we have to see if my bike starts putting my key in would help look oh come on hey something it smells so crazy riding Monkey Bikes in the main square of Cusco there's a bunch of other tourists walking around hi everyone I'm feeling great all right we just pulled off the main road there's more things to get interesting well it feels good to be off that Main Road still doesn't probably feel like we made it to the Jungle yet though also for the record my bike is not fixed at least not all the way fixed I haven't tested it on a uphill yet but it's still making that really awful noise but there's no turning back now [Music] all right gracias so the corn kernels in Peru are massive and they also make massive popcorn we've been driving past these bags for days and it wasn't until yesterday I discovered what it was and they make you kind of sweet like kettle corn this is one of my new favorite foods and save this for a better viewpoint [Music] s foreign it almost feels like we're cheating with how smoothly today is going both of the bikes are running great the road's beautiful I'm feeling healthy I think the antibiotics are kicking in and we've just stopped in the most beautiful little town for lunch I just keep feeling like something should go wrong at any moment it just hasn't yet [Applause] [Music] [Applause] getting some Gasolina and hitting rooms yeah how do you say the jungle Manu manuf we're ready to the Jungle I cannot believe we're here we are far from the Finish Line we can't celebrate yet but we've made it to the National Park the final stretch you ready for this [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] well that makes sense we're in a cloud forest we're in a cloud I can see it I can see the mist and that's why everything is foggy the camera lenses helmet goggles you can't see continue almost a la jungle oops I forgot to hold the glitch in I've forgotten everything well I think we can officially say that today has been the smoothest day of the entire trip we did 140 kilometers super easily it's 4 30. we're already at our accommodation for the night we found a lodge in the middle of the cloud forest and listen you know it's not going to wake us up tonight cars dogs people yelling guinea pigs roosters pigs a lady chopping wood at the foot of my bed I mean that was probably already my favorite night of the trip but this is gonna be so nice we're just perched on the side of a mountain right now and even when it gets really dark and cold these are windows so we can see the view from the inside this is the best day ever day seven we figured out the monkey run inside we have two beds which usually would make me sad but with Nate being a little under the weather it's been nice having separate beds then he can roll around get comfortable doing it he needs to do oh it was a nice bit this might be the best one we've had yet we have desk we have a what do you call these this has a name a very nice bathroom a shower with hot water he says I'll believe it when I feel it and a toilet where the number one rule it says is not to flush the toilet paper because outside of the mountain and I assume it all goes into a composting situation but overall very comfortable very happy we're here and there's coffee like right now we should go get it [Applause] what a life career living [Applause] like a monkey run anymore I mean who knows what tomorrow will bring this is so Nate and I didn't quite agree on this plan my vote was to go a bit further tonight and get as close to the Finish Line as possible and that way tomorrow there's no way that we are not crossing the Finish Line during the hours that it's open I know that sounds kind of weird but the finish line is only there from 4 to 6 p.m and if we don't cross during that time frame did we even do the monkey run we're currently 67 kilometers away from the finish line which sounds like no big deal we've done that every day of this trip no problem however we have not been in the Amazon jungle this entire trip we have no idea what's down there but of course Nate saw this place it seemed too good to be true and now that I'm here I'm very happy this was amazing it is 10 out of 10. we're currently getting a fire made for us as long as we cross that Finish Line tomorrow this was the best decision but that is to be determined last 67 kilometers of the trip I think he's gonna be a wet one and a fun one I'm feeling way better the end is in sight and weirdly enough I'm already feeling sad that it's over in a way it's a trip because and you try to stay alive like in a way I don't want it to be over but I am looking forward to getting to the Finish Line that's gonna feel good it's gonna be so fun since bit wet this morning let's see if she starts one last time it's gonna be a good day I might be a bit too optimistic [Music] place [Music] we'll see it's so foggy I already had to take my sunglasses off there we go the wet Trail has begun who knows if we'll be on Dry Road Again in the next 65 kilometers is this a tunnel oh my gosh it is the tunnel turns into a bridge oh this is crazy oh it's wet it's deep keep going my feet are soaked guys way to go she did it oh my gosh way to go are your feet wet barely ah of course that was nuts what do those signs mean it probably just means like okay donate I think these caves might be a thing you can't see anything it's better I'm so scared it's so dark okay that wasn't so bad oh man oh gosh I can't see anything oh okay this is not as bad it's not as wet baby check this out it's just right off the road what an amazing last day can't believe we're stopping to do sightseeing [Music] that was beautiful and terrifying I'm really hoping these are the river crossings that they were referring to because I got those down pat all right I know this sounds completely crazy to say after everything we've been through this week but at this point we were both starting to feel genuinely sad that this adventure was coming to an end it's amazing how quickly the miserable moments can fade from your memory as we drove down this beautiful Jungle Road all we could think about was how grateful we were for the lifelong memories we take away from this trip the intense challenge of this adventure made even the little things like a working bike and sunshine on our faces feel like the best possible things we can imagine in life and we're gonna miss the Simplicity that a journey like this brings to life there's something really beautiful about how the complexity of normal daily life just Fades away when the only goal of the day is to get from point A to point B without dying as this journey comes to a close we'd like to say the biggest thank you possible to the incredible people of Peru that we met along the way they're the only reason we finish this trip and we will never forget their generosity and Hospitality ready I hear music [Music] [Music] well I love you all right oh my gosh I almost went down [Music] believe it I can't believe it either oh nice one I'm so proud of you I did not have enough voice during this trip to express how proud I am of Kara she showed up having never driven a manual two-wheel vehicle and drove all the way across Peru honestly I feel so lucky this is probably the luckiest I've felt to not be injured after something cheers [Music] foreign [Music]"

Airbus uh but we said okay enjoy the flight I see the point that it's really made you uh you know very enjoyable okay because it's a level five skill is a more negative to fly however you go to the open side they always compute computerized so you enjoy to upload Those computer software or computer technique to find a modern airplane so I think it's a totally different philosophy between two companies so all different which way you are more interested you know so difficult to say who is a painter [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] is the Truffle waffle start thank you enjoy

we had two toys the first one is before coffee control and the other one is the shrimp pasta [Music] how's your business experience cheers very nice very nice what airline you normally fly to Taiwan even so I've been here with uh I've been Eva for years but most thing I don't like about it is that their flight they're playing to LA and Taiwan pretty aged yeah so they haven't upgrade and this is a nice change because a lot more privacy flying humor on your plane it's a much nicer experience so Sam what I have here is our business class mail for the optimizer we have the dog Stella with the balsamic Dresden and this is the mushroom with a Taco on it and we do have selections of the bread so for the business pass entree we do have three choices and this is the I'm showing you one of the choice which is the Hong Kong style halibut together with the rice and assorted vegetables foreign [Music] so the sliding door will be operated like this you can just close it for your own privacy we've got about seven and a half hours to go they dim the lights and first in business class get these pajamas they're green color not quite sure about this it's like a military kind of color and the cool thing is I didn't even go to the bathroom there was a cue so I actually changed the pajamas in my private Suites because it's got full privacy and the bedding where I'm still sitting on top is extremely soft I'm pretty sure I'm going to sleep quite well today [Music] it feels like you guys prepared a lot for this inaugural flight it's like one of your biggest milestone in this three-year-old airlock history we actually practiced once for the whole entire service for the first class and business class where did you practice you practice on the plane on the planet wow really yeah we we did like a hot run for that so I hope like everybody gets to enjoy this flight and then because we do put on a lot of effort on it good morning this one and a half hour from now before landing I wish the flight goes longer such a good flight uh there's a couple glitch happened during the middle nights one thing was my seats got stuck when I um you know uh go into the bathroom and it doesn't go recline and they have to reset and here I want to show you um this is a Bluetooth headset there's no wire it's amazing but there's also a glitch after 10 15 minute pairing with the entertainment system it just you know lost the sound and then I have to use the old um with a cable to connect again so hopefully they can iron this out I have nothing to say about the food it just the top I think this is what differentiate the starlux business class to the first class is the food is I'll give a 10 out of 10 just awesome especially if you love Asian food there's lots of Taiwanese local produce local influence in that I've never seen an airline serving boba tea and Boba latte and it started from Taiwan right rightfully Starbucks is serving what taiwan's doing the best boba tea cheers the only downside is because without a war divider without a bulkhead there's a bit of noise when during the meals you know everyone's using the Mills there's a bit of noise coming from the front of the galley and also the rare in the business class [Music] [Music] we are on design to Los Angeles so talk about starlux Airline I've been following them since 2020 when they launched they had a tough time because Colbert hit and they came in the worst time of Aviation and now three years later they launched Los Angeles I think the advantage of this Airline is they have new airplanes they started with a clean sheets new design so everything is brand new I think there might be a chance for them because the trans-pacific market hasn't fully recovered yet so with Starbucks adding service to Los Angeles if they are quick enough to adding more and more frequency they might be able to capture more traffic through Taiwan between us and Southeast Asia and the Taiwanese airport is quite easy to transfer as well it's not a very Mega airport not a complex Airport I spoke to the chairman earlier he said the next after La will be San Francisco and then Seattle and then we'll be Dallas and they're getting also the 8350 1000 in early 2025 and I wish the airline good luck [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] your Landing was one of the best on the E350 I have done a lot of hard Landings on the 350 slamming on the runway what's your secret what's their secret no secret just the prettiest prettiest and pretties okay the new Master you know always encourage yourself to face all the time very very happy with today's flight yeah and congratulations congratulations to La thank you so much foreign [Music]"

Konjac noodles and mushroom are placed into the pot It looks good! The meat was amazing It was so soft and tasted so beautiful The steaming hot vegetables went nicely in the creamy raw egg The other cut of the Yonezawa Beef is Tenderloin Normally each course is for 1 person but we requested to share The set comes with tea, pickled vegetable, miso soup and rice Japanese mustard greens spouts Wow, this cut was even more soft and tender! Must be the most tender meat I have ever eaten! It is so good I can\u2019t bear to finish it in 1 bite The sweet and savory flavors of the Sukiyaki flavored the ingredients nicely The miso soup came with beancurd skin and mini tofu cubes While there was a nice variety of pickles Overall this was a well pampered meal with the most delicious beef!
